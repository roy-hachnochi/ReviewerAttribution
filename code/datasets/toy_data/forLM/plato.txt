introduction.

in what relation the apology of plato stands to the real defence of
socrates, there are no means of determining. it certainly agrees in
tone and character with the description of xenophon, who says in the
memorabilia that socrates might have been acquitted 'if in any moderate
degree he would have conciliated the favour of the dicasts;' and who
informs us in another passage, on the testimony of hermogenes, the
friend of socrates, that he had no wish to live; and that the divine
sign refused to allow him to prepare a defence, and also that socrates
himself declared this to be unnecessary, on the ground that all his life
long he had been preparing against that hour. for the speech breathes
throughout a spirit of defiance, (ut non supplex aut reus sed magister
aut dominus videretur esse judicum', cic. de orat.); and the loose and
desultory style is an imitation of the 'accustomed manner' in
which socrates spoke in 'the agora and among the tables of the
money-changers.' the allusion in the crito may, perhaps, be adduced as a
further evidence of the literal accuracy of some parts. but in the
main it must be regarded as the ideal of socrates, according to plato's
conception of him, appearing in the greatest and most public scene of
his life, and in the height of his triumph, when he is weakest, and yet
his mastery over mankind is greatest, and his habitual irony acquires a
new meaning and a sort of tragic pathos in the face of death. the facts
of his life are summed up, and the features of his character are brought
out as if by accident in the course of the defence. the conversational
manner, the seeming want of arrangement, the ironical simplicity, are
found to result in a perfect work of art, which is the portrait of
socrates.

yet some of the topics may have been actually used by socrates; and
the recollection of his very words may have rung in the ears of his
disciple. the apology of plato may be compared generally with those
speeches of thucydides in which he has embodied his conception of the
lofty character and policy of the great pericles, and which at the same
time furnish a commentary on the situation of affairs from the point of
view of the historian. so in the apology there is an ideal rather than a
literal truth; much is said which was not said, and is only plato's view
of the situation. plato was not, like xenophon, a chronicler of facts;
he does not appear in any of his writings to have aimed at literal
accuracy. he is not therefore to be supplemented from the memorabilia
and symposium of xenophon, who belongs to an entirely different class of
writers. the apology of plato is not the report of what socrates said,
but an elaborate composition, quite as much so in fact as one of the
dialogues. and we may perhaps even indulge in the fancy that the actual
defence of socrates was as much greater than the platonic defence as the
master was greater than the disciple. but in any case, some of the words
used by him must have been remembered, and some of the facts recorded
must have actually occurred. it is significant that plato is said to
have been present at the defence (apol.), as he is also said to have
been absent at the last scene in the phaedo. is it fanciful to suppose
that he meant to give the stamp of authenticity to the one and not to
the other?--especially when we consider that these two passages are the
only ones in which plato makes mention of himself. the circumstance that
plato was to be one of his sureties for the payment of the fine which he
proposed has the appearance of truth. more suspicious is the statement
that socrates received the first impulse to his favourite calling of
cross-examining the world from the oracle of delphi; for he must already
have been famous before chaerephon went to consult the oracle (riddell),
and the story is of a kind which is very likely to have been invented.
on the whole we arrive at the conclusion that the apology is true to the
character of socrates, but we cannot show that any single sentence in it
was actually spoken by him. it breathes the spirit of socrates, but has
been cast anew in the mould of plato.

there is not much in the other dialogues which can be compared with the
apology. the same recollection of his master may have been present
to the mind of plato when depicting the sufferings of the just in the
republic. the crito may also be regarded as a sort of appendage to the
apology, in which socrates, who has defied the judges, is nevertheless
represented as scrupulously obedient to the laws. the idealization
of the sufferer is carried still further in the gorgias, in which the
thesis is maintained, that 'to suffer is better than to do evil;' and
the art of rhetoric is described as only useful for the purpose of
self-accusation. the parallelisms which occur in the so-called apology
of xenophon are not worth noticing, because the writing in which they
are contained is manifestly spurious. the statements of the memorabilia
respecting the trial and death of socrates agree generally with plato;
but they have lost the flavour of socratic irony in the narrative of
xenophon.

the apology or platonic defence of socrates is divided into three
parts: 1st. the defence properly so called; 2nd. the shorter address in
mitigation of the penalty; 3rd. the last words of prophetic rebuke and
exhortation.

the first part commences with an apology for his colloquial style;
he is, as he has always been, the enemy of rhetoric, and knows of
no rhetoric but truth; he will not falsify his character by making a
speech. then he proceeds to divide his accusers into two classes; first,
there is the nameless accuser--public opinion. all the world from their
earliest years had heard that he was a corrupter of youth, and had seen
him caricatured in the clouds of aristophanes. secondly, there are
the professed accusers, who are but the mouth-piece of the others. the
accusations of both might be summed up in a formula. the first say,
'socrates is an evil-doer and a curious person, searching into things
under the earth and above the heaven; and making the worse appear the
better cause, and teaching all this to others.' the second, 'socrates is
an evil-doer and corrupter of the youth, who does not receive the gods
whom the state receives, but introduces other new divinities.' these
last words appear to have been the actual indictment (compare xen.
mem.); and the previous formula, which is a summary of public opinion,
assumes the same legal style.

the answer begins by clearing up a confusion. in the representations
of the comic poets, and in the opinion of the multitude, he had been
identified with the teachers of physical science and with the sophists.
but this was an error. for both of them he professes a respect in the
open court, which contrasts with his manner of speaking about them in
other places. (compare for anaxagoras, phaedo, laws; for the sophists,
meno, republic, tim., theaet., soph., etc.) but at the same time
he shows that he is not one of them. of natural philosophy he knows
nothing; not that he despises such pursuits, but the fact is that he is
ignorant of them, and never says a word about them. nor is he paid for
giving instruction--that is another mistaken notion:--he has nothing to
teach. but he commends evenus for teaching virtue at such a 'moderate'
rate as five minae. something of the 'accustomed irony,' which may
perhaps be expected to sleep in the ear of the multitude, is lurking
here.

he then goes on to explain the reason why he is in such an evil name.
that had arisen out of a peculiar mission which he had taken upon
himself. the enthusiastic chaerephon (probably in anticipation of the
answer which he received) had gone to delphi and asked the oracle if
there was any man wiser than socrates; and the answer was, that there
was no man wiser. what could be the meaning of this--that he who knew
nothing, and knew that he knew nothing, should be declared by the oracle
to be the wisest of men? reflecting upon the answer, he determined to
refute it by finding 'a wiser;' and first he went to the politicians,
and then to the poets, and then to the craftsmen, but always with the
same result--he found that they knew nothing, or hardly anything more
than himself; and that the little advantage which in some cases they
possessed was more than counter-balanced by their conceit of knowledge.
he knew nothing, and knew that he knew nothing: they knew little or
nothing, and imagined that they knew all things. thus he had passed
his life as a sort of missionary in detecting the pretended wisdom of
mankind; and this occupation had quite absorbed him and taken him away
both from public and private affairs. young men of the richer sort had
made a pastime of the same pursuit, 'which was not unamusing.' and hence
bitter enmities had arisen; the professors of knowledge had revenged
themselves by calling him a villainous corrupter of youth, and by
repeating the commonplaces about atheism and materialism and sophistry,
which are the stock-accusations against all philosophers when there is
nothing else to be said of them.

the second accusation he meets by interrogating meletus, who is present
and can be interrogated. 'if he is the corrupter, who is the improver of
the citizens?' (compare meno.) 'all men everywhere.' but how absurd, how
contrary to analogy is this! how inconceivable too, that he should make
the citizens worse when he has to live with them. this surely cannot be
intentional; and if unintentional, he ought to have been instructed by
meletus, and not accused in the court.

but there is another part of the indictment which says that he teaches
men not to receive the gods whom the city receives, and has other new
gods. 'is that the way in which he is supposed to corrupt the youth?'
'yes, it is.' 'has he only new gods, or none at all?' 'none at all.'
'what, not even the sun and moon?' 'no; why, he says that the sun is a
stone, and the moon earth.' that, replies socrates, is the old confusion
about anaxagoras; the athenian people are not so ignorant as to
attribute to the influence of socrates notions which have found
their way into the drama, and may be learned at the theatre. socrates
undertakes to show that meletus (rather unjustifiably) has been
compounding a riddle in this part of the indictment: 'there are no gods,
but socrates believes in the existence of the sons of gods, which is
absurd.'

leaving meletus, who has had enough words spent upon him, he returns to
the original accusation. the question may be asked, why will he persist
in following a profession which leads him to death? why?--because he
must remain at his post where the god has placed him, as he remained
at potidaea, and amphipolis, and delium, where the generals placed him.
besides, he is not so overwise as to imagine that he knows whether death
is a good or an evil; and he is certain that desertion of his duty is
an evil. anytus is quite right in saying that they should never have
indicted him if they meant to let him go. for he will certainly obey god
rather than man; and will continue to preach to all men of all ages the
necessity of virtue and improvement; and if they refuse to listen to him
he will still persevere and reprove them. this is his way of corrupting
the youth, which he will not cease to follow in obedience to the god,
even if a thousand deaths await him.

he is desirous that they should let him live--not for his own sake, but
for theirs; because he is their heaven-sent friend (and they will never
have such another), or, as he may be ludicrously described, he is the
gadfly who stirs the generous steed into motion. why then has he never
taken part in public affairs? because the familiar divine voice has
hindered him; if he had been a public man, and had fought for the right,
as he would certainly have fought against the many, he would not have
lived, and could therefore have done no good. twice in public matters
he has risked his life for the sake of justice--once at the trial of
the generals; and again in resistance to the tyrannical commands of the
thirty.

but, though not a public man, he has passed his days in instructing
the citizens without fee or reward--this was his mission. whether his
disciples have turned out well or ill, he cannot justly be charged with
the result, for he never promised to teach them anything. they might
come if they liked, and they might stay away if they liked: and they
did come, because they found an amusement in hearing the pretenders to
wisdom detected. if they have been corrupted, their elder relatives (if
not themselves) might surely come into court and witness against him,
and there is an opportunity still for them to appear. but their fathers
and brothers all appear in court (including 'this' plato), to witness
on his behalf; and if their relatives are corrupted, at least they
are uncorrupted; 'and they are my witnesses. for they know that i am
speaking the truth, and that meletus is lying.'

this is about all that he has to say. he will not entreat the judges to
spare his life; neither will he present a spectacle of weeping children,
although he, too, is not made of 'rock or oak.' some of the judges
themselves may have complied with this practice on similar occasions,
and he trusts that they will not be angry with him for not following
their example. but he feels that such conduct brings discredit on the
name of athens: he feels too, that the judge has sworn not to give away
justice; and he cannot be guilty of the impiety of asking the judge to
break his oath, when he is himself being tried for impiety.

as he expected, and probably intended, he is convicted. and now the tone
of the speech, instead of being more conciliatory, becomes more
lofty and commanding. anytus proposes death as the penalty: and what
counter-proposition shall he make? he, the benefactor of the athenian
people, whose whole life has been spent in doing them good, should at
least have the olympic victor's reward of maintenance in the prytaneum.
or why should he propose any counter-penalty when he does not know
whether death, which anytus proposes, is a good or an evil? and he is
certain that imprisonment is an evil, exile is an evil. loss of money
might be an evil, but then he has none to give; perhaps he can make up
a mina. let that be the penalty, or, if his friends wish, thirty minae;
for which they will be excellent securities.

(he is condemned to death.)

he is an old man already, and the athenians will gain nothing but
disgrace by depriving him of a few years of life. perhaps he could have
escaped, if he had chosen to throw down his arms and entreat for his
life. but he does not at all repent of the manner of his defence; he
would rather die in his own fashion than live in theirs. for the penalty
of unrighteousness is swifter than death; that penalty has already
overtaken his accusers as death will soon overtake him.

and now, as one who is about to die, he will prophesy to them. they have
put him to death in order to escape the necessity of giving an account
of their lives. but his death 'will be the seed' of many disciples who
will convince them of their evil ways, and will come forth to reprove
them in harsher terms, because they are younger and more inconsiderate.

he would like to say a few words, while there is time, to those who
would have acquitted him. he wishes them to know that the divine sign
never interrupted him in the course of his defence; the reason of which,
as he conjectures, is that the death to which he is going is a good and
not an evil. for either death is a long sleep, the best of sleeps, or
a journey to another world in which the souls of the dead are gathered
together, and in which there may be a hope of seeing the heroes of
old--in which, too, there are just judges; and as all are immortal,
there can be no fear of any one suffering death for his opinions.

nothing evil can happen to the good man either in life or death, and his
own death has been permitted by the gods, because it was better for him
to depart; and therefore he forgives his judges because they have done
him no harm, although they never meant to do him any good.

he has a last request to make to them--that they will trouble his sons
as he has troubled them, if they appear to prefer riches to virtue, or
to think themselves something when they are nothing.

*****

'few persons will be found to wish that socrates should have defended
himself otherwise,'--if, as we must add, his defence was that with which
plato has provided him. but leaving this question, which does not admit
of a precise solution, we may go on to ask what was the impression which
plato in the apology intended to give of the character and conduct of
his master in the last great scene? did he intend to represent him (1)
as employing sophistries; (2) as designedly irritating the judges? or
are these sophistries to be regarded as belonging to the age in which
he lived and to his personal character, and this apparent haughtiness as
flowing from the natural elevation of his position?

for example, when he says that it is absurd to suppose that one man is
the corrupter and all the rest of the world the improvers of the youth;
or, when he argues that he never could have corrupted the men with whom
he had to live; or, when he proves his belief in the gods because
he believes in the sons of gods, is he serious or jesting? it may be
observed that these sophisms all occur in his cross-examination of
meletus, who is easily foiled and mastered in the hands of the great
dialectician. perhaps he regarded these answers as good enough for his
accuser, of whom he makes very light. also there is a touch of irony
in them, which takes them out of the category of sophistry. (compare
euthyph.)

that the manner in which he defends himself about the lives of his
disciples is not satisfactory, can hardly be denied. fresh in the memory
of the athenians, and detestable as they deserved to be to the newly
restored democracy, were the names of alcibiades, critias, charmides. it
is obviously not a sufficient answer that socrates had never professed
to teach them anything, and is therefore not justly chargeable with
their crimes. yet the defence, when taken out of this ironical form,
is doubtless sound: that his teaching had nothing to do with their evil
lives. here, then, the sophistry is rather in form than in substance,
though we might desire that to such a serious charge socrates had given
a more serious answer.

truly characteristic of socrates is another point in his answer, which
may also be regarded as sophistical. he says that 'if he has corrupted
the youth, he must have corrupted them involuntarily.' but if, as
socrates argues, all evil is involuntary, then all criminals ought to be
admonished and not punished. in these words the socratic doctrine of the
involuntariness of evil is clearly intended to be conveyed. here
again, as in the former instance, the defence of socrates is untrue
practically, but may be true in some ideal or transcendental sense. the
commonplace reply, that if he had been guilty of corrupting the youth
their relations would surely have witnessed against him, with which he
concludes this part of his defence, is more satisfactory.

again, when socrates argues that he must believe in the gods because he
believes in the sons of gods, we must remember that this is a refutation
not of the original indictment, which is consistent enough--'socrates
does not receive the gods whom the city receives, and has other new
divinities'--but of the interpretation put upon the words by meletus,
who has affirmed that he is a downright atheist. to this socrates fairly
answers, in accordance with the ideas of the time, that a downright
atheist cannot believe in the sons of gods or in divine things. the
notion that demons or lesser divinities are the sons of gods is not
to be regarded as ironical or sceptical. he is arguing 'ad hominem'
according to the notions of mythology current in his age. yet he
abstains from saying that he believed in the gods whom the state
approved. he does not defend himself, as xenophon has defended him,
by appealing to his practice of religion. probably he neither wholly
believed, nor disbelieved, in the existence of the popular gods; he
had no means of knowing about them. according to plato (compare phaedo;
symp.), as well as xenophon (memor.), he was punctual in the performance
of the least religious duties; and he must have believed in his own
oracular sign, of which he seemed to have an internal witness. but the
existence of apollo or zeus, or the other gods whom the state approves,
would have appeared to him both uncertain and unimportant in comparison
of the duty of self-examination, and of those principles of truth
and right which he deemed to be the foundation of religion. (compare
phaedr.; euthyph.; republic.)

the second question, whether plato meant to represent socrates as
braving or irritating his judges, must also be answered in the negative.
his irony, his superiority, his audacity, 'regarding not the person of
man,' necessarily flow out of the loftiness of his situation. he is not
acting a part upon a great occasion, but he is what he has been all his
life long, 'a king of men.' he would rather not appear insolent, if
he could avoid it (ouch os authadizomenos touto lego). neither is
he desirous of hastening his own end, for life and death are simply
indifferent to him. but such a defence as would be acceptable to his
judges and might procure an acquittal, it is not in his nature to make.
he will not say or do anything that might pervert the course of justice;
he cannot have his tongue bound even 'in the throat of death.' with
his accusers he will only fence and play, as he had fenced with other
'improvers of youth,' answering the sophist according to his sophistry
all his life long. he is serious when he is speaking of his own mission,
which seems to distinguish him from all other reformers of mankind, and
originates in an accident. the dedication of himself to the improvement
of his fellow-citizens is not so remarkable as the ironical spirit in
which he goes about doing good only in vindication of the credit of the
oracle, and in the vain hope of finding a wiser man than himself. yet
this singular and almost accidental character of his mission agrees with
the divine sign which, according to our notions, is equally accidental
and irrational, and is nevertheless accepted by him as the guiding
principle of his life. socrates is nowhere represented to us as a
freethinker or sceptic. there is no reason to doubt his sincerity when
he speculates on the possibility of seeing and knowing the heroes of the
trojan war in another world. on the other hand, his hope of immortality
is uncertain;--he also conceives of death as a long sleep (in
this respect differing from the phaedo), and at last falls back on
resignation to the divine will, and the certainty that no evil
can happen to the good man either in life or death. his absolute
truthfulness seems to hinder him from asserting positively more than
this; and he makes no attempt to veil his ignorance in mythology and
figures of speech. the gentleness of the first part of the speech
contrasts with the aggravated, almost threatening, tone of the
conclusion. he characteristically remarks that he will not speak as a
rhetorician, that is to say, he will not make a regular defence such as
lysias or one of the orators might have composed for him, or, according
to some accounts, did compose for him. but he first procures himself a
hearing by conciliatory words. he does not attack the sophists; for they
were open to the same charges as himself; they were equally ridiculed by
the comic poets, and almost equally hateful to anytus and meletus. yet
incidentally the antagonism between socrates and the sophists is allowed
to appear. he is poor and they are rich; his profession that he teaches
nothing is opposed to their readiness to teach all things; his talking
in the marketplace to their private instructions; his tarry-at-home life
to their wandering from city to city. the tone which he assumes towards
them is one of real friendliness, but also of concealed irony. towards
anaxagoras, who had disappointed him in his hopes of learning about mind
and nature, he shows a less kindly feeling, which is also the feeling
of plato in other passages (laws). but anaxagoras had been dead thirty
years, and was beyond the reach of persecution.

it has been remarked that the prophecy of a new generation of teachers
who would rebuke and exhort the athenian people in harsher and more
violent terms was, as far as we know, never fulfilled. no inference
can be drawn from this circumstance as to the probability of the
words attributed to him having been actually uttered. they express the
aspiration of the first martyr of philosophy, that he would leave behind
him many followers, accompanied by the not unnatural feeling that they
would be fiercer and more inconsiderate in their words when emancipated
from his control.

the above remarks must be understood as applying with any degree of
certainty to the platonic socrates only. for, although these or similar
words may have been spoken by socrates himself, we cannot exclude the
possibility, that like so much else, e.g. the wisdom of critias, the
poem of solon, the virtues of charmides, they may have been due only to
the imagination of plato. the arguments of those who maintain that the
apology was composed during the process, resting on no evidence, do not
require a serious refutation. nor are the reasonings of schleiermacher,
who argues that the platonic defence is an exact or nearly exact
reproduction of the words of socrates, partly because plato would not
have been guilty of the impiety of altering them, and also because many
points of the defence might have been improved and strengthened, at all
more conclusive. (see english translation.) what effect the death of
socrates produced on the mind of plato, we cannot certainly
determine; nor can we say how he would or must have written under the
circumstances. we observe that the enmity of aristophanes to socrates
does not prevent plato from introducing them together in the symposium
engaged in friendly intercourse. nor is there any trace in the dialogues
of an attempt to make anytus or meletus personally odious in the eyes of
the athenian public.




apology


how you, o athenians, have been affected by my accusers, i cannot tell;
but i know that they almost made me forget who i was--so persuasively
did they speak; and yet they have hardly uttered a word of truth. but
of the many falsehoods told by them, there was one which quite amazed
me;--i mean when they said that you should be upon your guard and not
allow yourselves to be deceived by the force of my eloquence. to say
this, when they were certain to be detected as soon as i opened my lips
and proved myself to be anything but a great speaker, did indeed appear
to me most shameless--unless by the force of eloquence they mean
the force of truth; for if such is their meaning, i admit that i am
eloquent. but in how different a way from theirs! well, as i was saying,
they have scarcely spoken the truth at all; but from me you shall hear
the whole truth: not, however, delivered after their manner in a set
oration duly ornamented with words and phrases. no, by heaven! but i
shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the moment; for
i am confident in the justice of my cause (or, i am certain that i am
right in taking this course.): at my time of life i ought not to be
appearing before you, o men of athens, in the character of a juvenile
orator--let no one expect it of me. and i must beg of you to grant me
a favour:--if i defend myself in my accustomed manner, and you hear me
using the words which i have been in the habit of using in the agora, at
the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere else, i would ask you not
to be surprised, and not to interrupt me on this account. for i am more
than seventy years of age, and appearing now for the first time in a
court of law, i am quite a stranger to the language of the place; and
therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger,
whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native tongue, and after the
fashion of his country:--am i making an unfair request of you? never
mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the
truth of my words, and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly
and the judge decide justly.

and first, i have to reply to the older charges and to my first
accusers, and then i will go on to the later ones. for of old i have had
many accusers, who have accused me falsely to you during many years;
and i am more afraid of them than of anytus and his associates, who are
dangerous, too, in their own way. but far more dangerous are the others,
who began when you were children, and took possession of your minds with
their falsehoods, telling of one socrates, a wise man, who speculated
about the heaven above, and searched into the earth beneath, and made
the worse appear the better cause. the disseminators of this tale are
the accusers whom i dread; for their hearers are apt to fancy that such
enquirers do not believe in the existence of the gods. and they are
many, and their charges against me are of ancient date, and they were
made by them in the days when you were more impressible than you are
now--in childhood, or it may have been in youth--and the cause when
heard went by default, for there was none to answer. and hardest of all,
i do not know and cannot tell the names of my accusers; unless in the
chance case of a comic poet. all who from envy and malice have persuaded
you--some of them having first convinced themselves--all this class of
men are most difficult to deal with; for i cannot have them up here, and
cross-examine them, and therefore i must simply fight with shadows in my
own defence, and argue when there is no one who answers. i will ask you
then to assume with me, as i was saying, that my opponents are of two
kinds; one recent, the other ancient: and i hope that you will see the
propriety of my answering the latter first, for these accusations you
heard long before the others, and much oftener.

well, then, i must make my defence, and endeavour to clear away in a
short time, a slander which has lasted a long time. may i succeed, if to
succeed be for my good and yours, or likely to avail me in my cause!
the task is not an easy one; i quite understand the nature of it. and so
leaving the event with god, in obedience to the law i will now make my
defence.

i will begin at the beginning, and ask what is the accusation which has
given rise to the slander of me, and in fact has encouraged meletus to
proof this charge against me. well, what do the slanderers say? they
shall be my prosecutors, and i will sum up their words in an affidavit:
'socrates is an evil-doer, and a curious person, who searches into
things under the earth and in heaven, and he makes the worse appear the
better cause; and he teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others.' such is
the nature of the accusation: it is just what you have yourselves seen
in the comedy of aristophanes (aristoph., clouds.), who has introduced a
man whom he calls socrates, going about and saying that he walks in
air, and talking a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which i do
not pretend to know either much or little--not that i mean to speak
disparagingly of any one who is a student of natural philosophy. i
should be very sorry if meletus could bring so grave a charge against
me. but the simple truth is, o athenians, that i have nothing to do with
physical speculations. very many of those here present are witnesses to
the truth of this, and to them i appeal. speak then, you who have heard
me, and tell your neighbours whether any of you have ever known me hold
forth in few words or in many upon such matters...you hear their answer.
and from what they say of this part of the charge you will be able to
judge of the truth of the rest.

as little foundation is there for the report that i am a teacher, and
take money; this accusation has no more truth in it than the other.
although, if a man were really able to instruct mankind, to receive
money for giving instruction would, in my opinion, be an honour to him.
there is gorgias of leontium, and prodicus of ceos, and hippias of elis,
who go the round of the cities, and are able to persuade the young men
to leave their own citizens by whom they might be taught for nothing,
and come to them whom they not only pay, but are thankful if they may be
allowed to pay them. there is at this time a parian philosopher residing
in athens, of whom i have heard; and i came to hear of him in this
way:--i came across a man who has spent a world of money on the
sophists, callias, the son of hipponicus, and knowing that he had sons,
i asked him: 'callias,' i said, 'if your two sons were foals or calves,
there would be no difficulty in finding some one to put over them; we
should hire a trainer of horses, or a farmer probably, who would improve
and perfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence; but as they
are human beings, whom are you thinking of placing over them? is there
any one who understands human and political virtue? you must have
thought about the matter, for you have sons; is there any one?' 'there
is,' he said. 'who is he?' said i; 'and of what country? and what does
he charge?' 'evenus the parian,' he replied; 'he is the man, and his
charge is five minae.' happy is evenus, i said to myself, if he really
has this wisdom, and teaches at such a moderate charge. had i the same,
i should have been very proud and conceited; but the truth is that i
have no knowledge of the kind.

i dare say, athenians, that some one among you will reply, 'yes,
socrates, but what is the origin of these accusations which are brought
against you; there must have been something strange which you have been
doing? all these rumours and this talk about you would never have arisen
if you had been like other men: tell us, then, what is the cause of
them, for we should be sorry to judge hastily of you.' now i regard this
as a fair challenge, and i will endeavour to explain to you the reason
why i am called wise and have such an evil fame. please to attend then.
and although some of you may think that i am joking, i declare that i
will tell you the entire truth. men of athens, this reputation of mine
has come of a certain sort of wisdom which i possess. if you ask me what
kind of wisdom, i reply, wisdom such as may perhaps be attained by man,
for to that extent i am inclined to believe that i am wise; whereas the
persons of whom i was speaking have a superhuman wisdom which i may fail
to describe, because i have it not myself; and he who says that i have,
speaks falsely, and is taking away my character. and here, o men of
athens, i must beg you not to interrupt me, even if i seem to say
something extravagant. for the word which i will speak is not mine. i
will refer you to a witness who is worthy of credit; that witness shall
be the god of delphi--he will tell you about my wisdom, if i have any,
and of what sort it is. you must have known chaerephon; he was early a
friend of mine, and also a friend of yours, for he shared in the recent
exile of the people, and returned with you. well, chaerephon, as you
know, was very impetuous in all his doings, and he went to delphi and
boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether--as i was saying, i must beg
you not to interrupt--he asked the oracle to tell him whether anyone was
wiser than i was, and the pythian prophetess answered, that there was no
man wiser. chaerephon is dead himself; but his brother, who is in court,
will confirm the truth of what i am saying.

why do i mention this? because i am going to explain to you why i have
such an evil name. when i heard the answer, i said to myself, what can
the god mean? and what is the interpretation of his riddle? for i know
that i have no wisdom, small or great. what then can he mean when he
says that i am the wisest of men? and yet he is a god, and cannot lie;
that would be against his nature. after long consideration, i thought of
a method of trying the question. i reflected that if i could only find
a man wiser than myself, then i might go to the god with a refutation in
my hand. i should say to him, 'here is a man who is wiser than i am; but
you said that i was the wisest.' accordingly i went to one who had the
reputation of wisdom, and observed him--his name i need not mention; he
was a politician whom i selected for examination--and the result was as
follows: when i began to talk with him, i could not help thinking that
he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and
still wiser by himself; and thereupon i tried to explain to him that he
thought himself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was
that he hated me, and his enmity was shared by several who were present
and heard me. so i left him, saying to myself, as i went away: well,
although i do not suppose that either of us knows anything really
beautiful and good, i am better off than he is,--for he knows nothing,
and thinks that he knows; i neither know nor think that i know. in this
latter particular, then, i seem to have slightly the advantage of him.
then i went to another who had still higher pretensions to wisdom, and
my conclusion was exactly the same. whereupon i made another enemy of
him, and of many others besides him.

then i went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the
enmity which i provoked, and i lamented and feared this: but necessity
was laid upon me,--the word of god, i thought, ought to be considered
first. and i said to myself, go i must to all who appear to know, and
find out the meaning of the oracle. and i swear to you, athenians,
by the dog i swear!--for i must tell you the truth--the result of my
mission was just this: i found that the men most in repute were all but
the most foolish; and that others less esteemed were really wiser and
better. i will tell you the tale of my wanderings and of the 'herculean'
labours, as i may call them, which i endured only to find at last the
oracle irrefutable. after the politicians, i went to the poets; tragic,
dithyrambic, and all sorts. and there, i said to myself, you will be
instantly detected; now you will find out that you are more ignorant
than they are. accordingly, i took them some of the most elaborate
passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning of
them--thinking that they would teach me something. will you believe me?
i am almost ashamed to confess the truth, but i must say that there is
hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their
poetry than they did themselves. then i knew that not by wisdom do poets
write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like
diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not
understand the meaning of them. the poets appeared to me to be much in
the same case; and i further observed that upon the strength of their
poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things
in which they were not wise. so i departed, conceiving myself to
be superior to them for the same reason that i was superior to the
politicians.

at last i went to the artisans. i was conscious that i knew nothing at
all, as i may say, and i was sure that they knew many fine things; and
here i was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which i
was ignorant, and in this they certainly were wiser than i was. but i
observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the
poets;--because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew
all sorts of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed their
wisdom; and therefore i asked myself on behalf of the oracle, whether
i would like to be as i was, neither having their knowledge nor their
ignorance, or like them in both; and i made answer to myself and to the
oracle that i was better off as i was.

this inquisition has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most
dangerous kind, and has given occasion also to many calumnies. and i
am called wise, for my hearers always imagine that i myself possess
the wisdom which i find wanting in others: but the truth is, o men of
athens, that god only is wise; and by his answer he intends to show
that the wisdom of men is worth little or nothing; he is not speaking
of socrates, he is only using my name by way of illustration, as if
he said, he, o men, is the wisest, who, like socrates, knows that his
wisdom is in truth worth nothing. and so i go about the world, obedient
to the god, and search and make enquiry into the wisdom of any one,
whether citizen or stranger, who appears to be wise; and if he is not
wise, then in vindication of the oracle i show him that he is not wise;
and my occupation quite absorbs me, and i have no time to give either to
any public matter of interest or to any concern of my own, but i am in
utter poverty by reason of my devotion to the god.

there is another thing:--young men of the richer classes, who have not
much to do, come about me of their own accord; they like to hear the
pretenders examined, and they often imitate me, and proceed to examine
others; there are plenty of persons, as they quickly discover, who think
that they know something, but really know little or nothing; and then
those who are examined by them instead of being angry with themselves
are angry with me: this confounded socrates, they say; this villainous
misleader of youth!--and then if somebody asks them, why, what evil does
he practise or teach? they do not know, and cannot tell; but in order
that they may not appear to be at a loss, they repeat the ready-made
charges which are used against all philosophers about teaching things
up in the clouds and under the earth, and having no gods, and making
the worse appear the better cause; for they do not like to confess that
their pretence of knowledge has been detected--which is the truth; and
as they are numerous and ambitious and energetic, and are drawn up in
battle array and have persuasive tongues, they have filled your ears
with their loud and inveterate calumnies. and this is the reason why my
three accusers, meletus and anytus and lycon, have set upon me; meletus,
who has a quarrel with me on behalf of the poets; anytus, on behalf of
the craftsmen and politicians; lycon, on behalf of the rhetoricians: and
as i said at the beginning, i cannot expect to get rid of such a mass of
calumny all in a moment. and this, o men of athens, is the truth and the
whole truth; i have concealed nothing, i have dissembled nothing. and
yet, i know that my plainness of speech makes them hate me, and what is
their hatred but a proof that i am speaking the truth?--hence has arisen
the prejudice against me; and this is the reason of it, as you will find
out either in this or in any future enquiry.

i have said enough in my defence against the first class of my accusers;
i turn to the second class. they are headed by meletus, that good man
and true lover of his country, as he calls himself. against these, too,
i must try to make a defence:--let their affidavit be read: it contains
something of this kind: it says that socrates is a doer of evil, who
corrupts the youth; and who does not believe in the gods of the state,
but has other new divinities of his own. such is the charge; and now let
us examine the particular counts. he says that i am a doer of evil, and
corrupt the youth; but i say, o men of athens, that meletus is a doer of
evil, in that he pretends to be in earnest when he is only in jest, and
is so eager to bring men to trial from a pretended zeal and interest
about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest. and
the truth of this i will endeavour to prove to you.

come hither, meletus, and let me ask a question of you. you think a
great deal about the improvement of youth?

yes, i do.

tell the judges, then, who is their improver; for you must know, as you
have taken the pains to discover their corrupter, and are citing and
accusing me before them. speak, then, and tell the judges who their
improver is.--observe, meletus, that you are silent, and have nothing to
say. but is not this rather disgraceful, and a very considerable proof
of what i was saying, that you have no interest in the matter? speak up,
friend, and tell us who their improver is.

the laws.

but that, my good sir, is not my meaning. i want to know who the person
is, who, in the first place, knows the laws.

the judges, socrates, who are present in court.

what, do you mean to say, meletus, that they are able to instruct and
improve youth?

certainly they are.

what, all of them, or some only and not others?

all of them.

by the goddess here, that is good news! there are plenty of improvers,
then. and what do you say of the audience,--do they improve them?

yes, they do.

and the senators?

yes, the senators improve them.

but perhaps the members of the assembly corrupt them?--or do they too
improve them?

they improve them.

then every athenian improves and elevates them; all with the exception
of myself; and i alone am their corrupter? is that what you affirm?

that is what i stoutly affirm.

i am very unfortunate if you are right. but suppose i ask you a
question: how about horses? does one man do them harm and all the world
good? is not the exact opposite the truth? one man is able to do them
good, or at least not many;--the trainer of horses, that is to say, does
them good, and others who have to do with them rather injure them?
is not that true, meletus, of horses, or of any other animals? most
assuredly it is; whether you and anytus say yes or no. happy indeed
would be the condition of youth if they had one corrupter only, and
all the rest of the world were their improvers. but you, meletus, have
sufficiently shown that you never had a thought about the young: your
carelessness is seen in your not caring about the very things which you
bring against me.

and now, meletus, i will ask you another question--by zeus i will:
which is better, to live among bad citizens, or among good ones? answer,
friend, i say; the question is one which may be easily answered. do not
the good do their neighbours good, and the bad do them evil?

certainly.

and is there anyone who would rather be injured than benefited by those
who live with him? answer, my good friend, the law requires you to
answer--does any one like to be injured?

certainly not.

and when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth, do you
allege that i corrupt them intentionally or unintentionally?

intentionally, i say.

but you have just admitted that the good do their neighbours good, and
the evil do them evil. now, is that a truth which your superior wisdom
has recognized thus early in life, and am i, at my age, in such darkness
and ignorance as not to know that if a man with whom i have to live is
corrupted by me, i am very likely to be harmed by him; and yet i corrupt
him, and intentionally, too--so you say, although neither i nor any
other human being is ever likely to be convinced by you. but either i do
not corrupt them, or i corrupt them unintentionally; and on either view
of the case you lie. if my offence is unintentional, the law has
no cognizance of unintentional offences: you ought to have taken me
privately, and warned and admonished me; for if i had been
better advised, i should have left off doing what i only did
unintentionally--no doubt i should; but you would have nothing to say to
me and refused to teach me. and now you bring me up in this court, which
is a place not of instruction, but of punishment.

it will be very clear to you, athenians, as i was saying, that meletus
has no care at all, great or small, about the matter. but still i should
like to know, meletus, in what i am affirmed to corrupt the young. i
suppose you mean, as i infer from your indictment, that i teach them not
to acknowledge the gods which the state acknowledges, but some other new
divinities or spiritual agencies in their stead. these are the lessons
by which i corrupt the youth, as you say.

yes, that i say emphatically.

then, by the gods, meletus, of whom we are speaking, tell me and the
court, in somewhat plainer terms, what you mean! for i do not as yet
understand whether you affirm that i teach other men to acknowledge
some gods, and therefore that i do believe in gods, and am not an entire
atheist--this you do not lay to my charge,--but only you say that they
are not the same gods which the city recognizes--the charge is that they
are different gods. or, do you mean that i am an atheist simply, and a
teacher of atheism?

i mean the latter--that you are a complete atheist.

what an extraordinary statement! why do you think so, meletus? do you
mean that i do not believe in the godhead of the sun or moon, like other
men?

i assure you, judges, that he does not: for he says that the sun is
stone, and the moon earth.

friend meletus, you think that you are accusing anaxagoras: and you have
but a bad opinion of the judges, if you fancy them illiterate to such
a degree as not to know that these doctrines are found in the books of
anaxagoras the clazomenian, which are full of them. and so, forsooth,
the youth are said to be taught them by socrates, when there are not
unfrequently exhibitions of them at the theatre (probably in allusion to
aristophanes who caricatured, and to euripides who borrowed the notions
of anaxagoras, as well as to other dramatic poets.) (price of admission
one drachma at the most); and they might pay their money, and laugh at
socrates if he pretends to father these extraordinary views. and so,
meletus, you really think that i do not believe in any god?

i swear by zeus that you believe absolutely in none at all.

nobody will believe you, meletus, and i am pretty sure that you do not
believe yourself. i cannot help thinking, men of athens, that meletus
is reckless and impudent, and that he has written this indictment in a
spirit of mere wantonness and youthful bravado. has he not compounded a
riddle, thinking to try me? he said to himself:--i shall see whether
the wise socrates will discover my facetious contradiction, or whether i
shall be able to deceive him and the rest of them. for he certainly does
appear to me to contradict himself in the indictment as much as if he
said that socrates is guilty of not believing in the gods, and yet of
believing in them--but this is not like a person who is in earnest.

i should like you, o men of athens, to join me in examining what i
conceive to be his inconsistency; and do you, meletus, answer. and
i must remind the audience of my request that they would not make a
disturbance if i speak in my accustomed manner:

did ever man, meletus, believe in the existence of human things, and not
of human beings?...i wish, men of athens, that he would answer, and not
be always trying to get up an interruption. did ever any man believe
in horsemanship, and not in horses? or in flute-playing, and not in
flute-players? no, my friend; i will answer to you and to the court, as
you refuse to answer for yourself. there is no man who ever did. but now
please to answer the next question: can a man believe in spiritual and
divine agencies, and not in spirits or demigods?

he cannot.

how lucky i am to have extracted that answer, by the assistance of the
court! but then you swear in the indictment that i teach and believe in
divine or spiritual agencies (new or old, no matter for that); at any
rate, i believe in spiritual agencies,--so you say and swear in the
affidavit; and yet if i believe in divine beings, how can i help
believing in spirits or demigods;--must i not? to be sure i must; and
therefore i may assume that your silence gives consent. now what are
spirits or demigods? are they not either gods or the sons of gods?

certainly they are.

but this is what i call the facetious riddle invented by you: the
demigods or spirits are gods, and you say first that i do not believe in
gods, and then again that i do believe in gods; that is, if i believe in
demigods. for if the demigods are the illegitimate sons of gods, whether
by the nymphs or by any other mothers, of whom they are said to be the
sons--what human being will ever believe that there are no gods if they
are the sons of gods? you might as well affirm the existence of mules,
and deny that of horses and asses. such nonsense, meletus, could only
have been intended by you to make trial of me. you have put this into
the indictment because you had nothing real of which to accuse me. but
no one who has a particle of understanding will ever be convinced by you
that the same men can believe in divine and superhuman things, and yet
not believe that there are gods and demigods and heroes.

i have said enough in answer to the charge of meletus: any elaborate
defence is unnecessary, but i know only too well how many are the
enmities which i have incurred, and this is what will be my destruction
if i am destroyed;--not meletus, nor yet anytus, but the envy and
detraction of the world, which has been the death of many good men, and
will probably be the death of many more; there is no danger of my being
the last of them.

some one will say: and are you not ashamed, socrates, of a course of
life which is likely to bring you to an untimely end? to him i may
fairly answer: there you are mistaken: a man who is good for anything
ought not to calculate the chance of living or dying; he ought only to
consider whether in doing anything he is doing right or wrong--acting
the part of a good man or of a bad. whereas, upon your view, the heroes
who fell at troy were not good for much, and the son of thetis above
all, who altogether despised danger in comparison with disgrace; and
when he was so eager to slay hector, his goddess mother said to him,
that if he avenged his companion patroclus, and slew hector, he would
die himself--'fate,' she said, in these or the like words, 'waits for
you next after hector;' he, receiving this warning, utterly despised
danger and death, and instead of fearing them, feared rather to live
in dishonour, and not to avenge his friend. 'let me die forthwith,'
he replies, 'and be avenged of my enemy, rather than abide here by the
beaked ships, a laughing-stock and a burden of the earth.' had achilles
any thought of death and danger? for wherever a man's place is, whether
the place which he has chosen or that in which he has been placed by a
commander, there he ought to remain in the hour of danger; he should
not think of death or of anything but of disgrace. and this, o men of
athens, is a true saying.

strange, indeed, would be my conduct, o men of athens, if i who, when i
was ordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at potidaea
and amphipolis and delium, remained where they placed me, like any other
man, facing death--if now, when, as i conceive and imagine, god orders
me to fulfil the philosopher's mission of searching into myself and
other men, i were to desert my post through fear of death, or any other
fear; that would indeed be strange, and i might justly be arraigned in
court for denying the existence of the gods, if i disobeyed the oracle
because i was afraid of death, fancying that i was wise when i was not
wise. for the fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom, and not
real wisdom, being a pretence of knowing the unknown; and no one knows
whether death, which men in their fear apprehend to be the greatest
evil, may not be the greatest good. is not this ignorance of a
disgraceful sort, the ignorance which is the conceit that a man knows
what he does not know? and in this respect only i believe myself to
differ from men in general, and may perhaps claim to be wiser than
they are:--that whereas i know but little of the world below, i do not
suppose that i know: but i do know that injustice and disobedience to a
better, whether god or man, is evil and dishonourable, and i will never
fear or avoid a possible good rather than a certain evil. and therefore
if you let me go now, and are not convinced by anytus, who said that
since i had been prosecuted i must be put to death; (or if not that i
ought never to have been prosecuted at all); and that if i escape now,
your sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my words--if you
say to me, socrates, this time we will not mind anytus, and you shall
be let off, but upon one condition, that you are not to enquire and
speculate in this way any more, and that if you are caught doing so
again you shall die;--if this was the condition on which you let me go,
i should reply: men of athens, i honour and love you; but i shall obey
god rather than you, and while i have life and strength i shall never
cease from the practice and teaching of philosophy, exhorting any
one whom i meet and saying to him after my manner: you, my friend,--a
citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of athens,--are you
not ashamed of heaping up the greatest amount of money and honour and
reputation, and caring so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest
improvement of the soul, which you never regard or heed at all? and if
the person with whom i am arguing, says: yes, but i do care; then i do
not leave him or let him go at once; but i proceed to interrogate and
examine and cross-examine him, and if i think that he has no virtue in
him, but only says that he has, i reproach him with undervaluing the
greater, and overvaluing the less. and i shall repeat the same words to
every one whom i meet, young and old, citizen and alien, but especially
to the citizens, inasmuch as they are my brethren. for know that this is
the command of god; and i believe that no greater good has ever happened
in the state than my service to the god. for i do nothing but go about
persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take thought for your
persons or your properties, but first and chiefly to care about the
greatest improvement of the soul. i tell you that virtue is not given
by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of
man, public as well as private. this is my teaching, and if this is the
doctrine which corrupts the youth, i am a mischievous person. but if
any one says that this is not my teaching, he is speaking an untruth.
wherefore, o men of athens, i say to you, do as anytus bids or not
as anytus bids, and either acquit me or not; but whichever you do,
understand that i shall never alter my ways, not even if i have to die
many times.

men of athens, do not interrupt, but hear me; there was an understanding
between us that you should hear me to the end: i have something more to
say, at which you may be inclined to cry out; but i believe that to hear
me will be good for you, and therefore i beg that you will not cry out.
i would have you know, that if you kill such an one as i am, you will
injure yourselves more than you will injure me. nothing will injure me,
not meletus nor yet anytus--they cannot, for a bad man is not permitted
to injure a better than himself. i do not deny that anytus may, perhaps,
kill him, or drive him into exile, or deprive him of civil rights; and
he may imagine, and others may imagine, that he is inflicting a great
injury upon him: but there i do not agree. for the evil of doing as
he is doing--the evil of unjustly taking away the life of another--is
greater far.

and now, athenians, i am not going to argue for my own sake, as you may
think, but for yours, that you may not sin against the god by condemning
me, who am his gift to you. for if you kill me you will not easily find
a successor to me, who, if i may use such a ludicrous figure of speech,
am a sort of gadfly, given to the state by god; and the state is a great
and noble steed who is tardy in his motions owing to his very size,
and requires to be stirred into life. i am that gadfly which god has
attached to the state, and all day long and in all places am always
fastening upon you, arousing and persuading and reproaching you. you
will not easily find another like me, and therefore i would advise you
to spare me. i dare say that you may feel out of temper (like a person
who is suddenly awakened from sleep), and you think that you might
easily strike me dead as anytus advises, and then you would sleep on
for the remainder of your lives, unless god in his care of you sent you
another gadfly. when i say that i am given to you by god, the proof of
my mission is this:--if i had been like other men, i should not have
neglected all my own concerns or patiently seen the neglect of them
during all these years, and have been doing yours, coming to you
individually like a father or elder brother, exhorting you to regard
virtue; such conduct, i say, would be unlike human nature. if i had
gained anything, or if my exhortations had been paid, there would have
been some sense in my doing so; but now, as you will perceive, not even
the impudence of my accusers dares to say that i have ever exacted
or sought pay of any one; of that they have no witness. and i have a
sufficient witness to the truth of what i say--my poverty.

some one may wonder why i go about in private giving advice and busying
myself with the concerns of others, but do not venture to come forward
in public and advise the state. i will tell you why. you have heard me
speak at sundry times and in divers places of an oracle or sign
which comes to me, and is the divinity which meletus ridicules in the
indictment. this sign, which is a kind of voice, first began to come
to me when i was a child; it always forbids but never commands me to
do anything which i am going to do. this is what deters me from being a
politician. and rightly, as i think. for i am certain, o men of athens,
that if i had engaged in politics, i should have perished long ago, and
done no good either to you or to myself. and do not be offended at my
telling you the truth: for the truth is, that no man who goes to war
with you or any other multitude, honestly striving against the many
lawless and unrighteous deeds which are done in a state, will save his
life; he who will fight for the right, if he would live even for a brief
space, must have a private station and not a public one.

i can give you convincing evidence of what i say, not words only, but
what you value far more--actions. let me relate to you a passage of my
own life which will prove to you that i should never have yielded to
injustice from any fear of death, and that 'as i should have refused to
yield' i must have died at once. i will tell you a tale of the courts,
not very interesting perhaps, but nevertheless true. the only office of
state which i ever held, o men of athens, was that of senator: the tribe
antiochis, which is my tribe, had the presidency at the trial of the
generals who had not taken up the bodies of the slain after the battle
of arginusae; and you proposed to try them in a body, contrary to law,
as you all thought afterwards; but at the time i was the only one of the
prytanes who was opposed to the illegality, and i gave my vote against
you; and when the orators threatened to impeach and arrest me, and you
called and shouted, i made up my mind that i would run the risk, having
law and justice with me, rather than take part in your injustice because
i feared imprisonment and death. this happened in the days of the
democracy. but when the oligarchy of the thirty was in power, they sent
for me and four others into the rotunda, and bade us bring leon the
salaminian from salamis, as they wanted to put him to death. this was a
specimen of the sort of commands which they were always giving with
the view of implicating as many as possible in their crimes; and then i
showed, not in word only but in deed, that, if i may be allowed to use
such an expression, i cared not a straw for death, and that my great and
only care was lest i should do an unrighteous or unholy thing. for
the strong arm of that oppressive power did not frighten me into doing
wrong; and when we came out of the rotunda the other four went to
salamis and fetched leon, but i went quietly home. for which i might
have lost my life, had not the power of the thirty shortly afterwards
come to an end. and many will witness to my words.

now do you really imagine that i could have survived all these years,
if i had led a public life, supposing that like a good man i had always
maintained the right and had made justice, as i ought, the first thing?
no indeed, men of athens, neither i nor any other man. but i have been
always the same in all my actions, public as well as private, and never
have i yielded any base compliance to those who are slanderously termed
my disciples, or to any other. not that i have any regular disciples.
but if any one likes to come and hear me while i am pursuing my mission,
whether he be young or old, he is not excluded. nor do i converse only
with those who pay; but any one, whether he be rich or poor, may ask and
answer me and listen to my words; and whether he turns out to be a bad
man or a good one, neither result can be justly imputed to me; for i
never taught or professed to teach him anything. and if any one says
that he has ever learned or heard anything from me in private which all
the world has not heard, let me tell you that he is lying.

but i shall be asked, why do people delight in continually conversing
with you? i have told you already, athenians, the whole truth about this
matter: they like to hear the cross-examination of the pretenders to
wisdom; there is amusement in it. now this duty of cross-examining other
men has been imposed upon me by god; and has been signified to me by
oracles, visions, and in every way in which the will of divine power was
ever intimated to any one. this is true, o athenians, or, if not true,
would be soon refuted. if i am or have been corrupting the youth, those
of them who are now grown up and have become sensible that i gave them
bad advice in the days of their youth should come forward as accusers,
and take their revenge; or if they do not like to come themselves, some
of their relatives, fathers, brothers, or other kinsmen, should say what
evil their families have suffered at my hands. now is their time. many
of them i see in the court. there is crito, who is of the same age and
of the same deme with myself, and there is critobulus his son, whom i
also see. then again there is lysanias of sphettus, who is the father of
aeschines--he is present; and also there is antiphon of cephisus, who is
the father of epigenes; and there are the brothers of several who have
associated with me. there is nicostratus the son of theosdotides, and
the brother of theodotus (now theodotus himself is dead, and therefore
he, at any rate, will not seek to stop him); and there is paralus the
son of demodocus, who had a brother theages; and adeimantus the son of
ariston, whose brother plato is present; and aeantodorus, who is the
brother of apollodorus, whom i also see. i might mention a great many
others, some of whom meletus should have produced as witnesses in
the course of his speech; and let him still produce them, if he has
forgotten--i will make way for him. and let him say, if he has any
testimony of the sort which he can produce. nay, athenians, the very
opposite is the truth. for all these are ready to witness on behalf of
the corrupter, of the injurer of their kindred, as meletus and anytus
call me; not the corrupted youth only--there might have been a motive
for that--but their uncorrupted elder relatives. why should they too
support me with their testimony? why, indeed, except for the sake of
truth and justice, and because they know that i am speaking the truth,
and that meletus is a liar.

well, athenians, this and the like of this is all the defence which i
have to offer. yet a word more. perhaps there may be some one who is
offended at me, when he calls to mind how he himself on a similar, or
even a less serious occasion, prayed and entreated the judges with many
tears, and how he produced his children in court, which was a moving
spectacle, together with a host of relations and friends; whereas i,
who am probably in danger of my life, will do none of these things. the
contrast may occur to his mind, and he may be set against me, and vote
in anger because he is displeased at me on this account. now if there
be such a person among you,--mind, i do not say that there is,--to him i
may fairly reply: my friend, i am a man, and like other men, a creature
of flesh and blood, and not 'of wood or stone,' as homer says; and i
have a family, yes, and sons, o athenians, three in number, one almost a
man, and two others who are still young; and yet i will not bring any of
them hither in order to petition you for an acquittal. and why not? not
from any self-assertion or want of respect for you. whether i am or am
not afraid of death is another question, of which i will not now speak.
but, having regard to public opinion, i feel that such conduct would be
discreditable to myself, and to you, and to the whole state. one who
has reached my years, and who has a name for wisdom, ought not to demean
himself. whether this opinion of me be deserved or not, at any rate the
world has decided that socrates is in some way superior to other
men. and if those among you who are said to be superior in wisdom
and courage, and any other virtue, demean themselves in this way, how
shameful is their conduct! i have seen men of reputation, when they have
been condemned, behaving in the strangest manner: they seemed to fancy
that they were going to suffer something dreadful if they died, and that
they could be immortal if you only allowed them to live; and i think
that such are a dishonour to the state, and that any stranger coming in
would have said of them that the most eminent men of athens, to whom the
athenians themselves give honour and command, are no better than women.
and i say that these things ought not to be done by those of us who have
a reputation; and if they are done, you ought not to permit them; you
ought rather to show that you are far more disposed to condemn the man
who gets up a doleful scene and makes the city ridiculous, than him who
holds his peace.

but, setting aside the question of public opinion, there seems to be
something wrong in asking a favour of a judge, and thus procuring an
acquittal, instead of informing and convincing him. for his duty is,
not to make a present of justice, but to give judgment; and he has sworn
that he will judge according to the laws, and not according to his own
good pleasure; and we ought not to encourage you, nor should you allow
yourselves to be encouraged, in this habit of perjury--there can be
no piety in that. do not then require me to do what i consider
dishonourable and impious and wrong, especially now, when i am being
tried for impiety on the indictment of meletus. for if, o men of athens,
by force of persuasion and entreaty i could overpower your oaths, then
i should be teaching you to believe that there are no gods, and in
defending should simply convict myself of the charge of not believing in
them. but that is not so--far otherwise. for i do believe that there
are gods, and in a sense higher than that in which any of my accusers
believe in them. and to you and to god i commit my cause, to be
determined by you as is best for you and me.

*****

there are many reasons why i am not grieved, o men of athens, at the
vote of condemnation. i expected it, and am only surprised that the
votes are so nearly equal; for i had thought that the majority against
me would have been far larger; but now, had thirty votes gone over to
the other side, i should have been acquitted. and i may say, i think,
that i have escaped meletus. i may say more; for without the assistance
of anytus and lycon, any one may see that he would not have had a fifth
part of the votes, as the law requires, in which case he would have
incurred a fine of a thousand drachmae.

and so he proposes death as the penalty. and what shall i propose on my
part, o men of athens? clearly that which is my due. and what is my due?
what return shall be made to the man who has never had the wit to be
idle during his whole life; but has been careless of what the many care
for--wealth, and family interests, and military offices, and speaking in
the assembly, and magistracies, and plots, and parties. reflecting that
i was really too honest a man to be a politician and live, i did not go
where i could do no good to you or to myself; but where i could do the
greatest good privately to every one of you, thither i went, and sought
to persuade every man among you that he must look to himself, and seek
virtue and wisdom before he looks to his private interests, and look to
the state before he looks to the interests of the state; and that this
should be the order which he observes in all his actions. what shall be
done to such an one? doubtless some good thing, o men of athens, if he
has his reward; and the good should be of a kind suitable to him. what
would be a reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor, and
who desires leisure that he may instruct you? there can be no reward so
fitting as maintenance in the prytaneum, o men of athens, a reward which
he deserves far more than the citizen who has won the prize at olympia
in the horse or chariot race, whether the chariots were drawn by two
horses or by many. for i am in want, and he has enough; and he only
gives you the appearance of happiness, and i give you the reality. and
if i am to estimate the penalty fairly, i should say that maintenance in
the prytaneum is the just return.

perhaps you think that i am braving you in what i am saying now, as in
what i said before about the tears and prayers. but this is not so. i
speak rather because i am convinced that i never intentionally wronged
any one, although i cannot convince you--the time has been too short; if
there were a law at athens, as there is in other cities, that a capital
cause should not be decided in one day, then i believe that i should
have convinced you. but i cannot in a moment refute great slanders; and,
as i am convinced that i never wronged another, i will assuredly not
wrong myself. i will not say of myself that i deserve any evil, or
propose any penalty. why should i? because i am afraid of the penalty of
death which meletus proposes? when i do not know whether death is a good
or an evil, why should i propose a penalty which would certainly be an
evil? shall i say imprisonment? and why should i live in prison, and be
the slave of the magistrates of the year--of the eleven? or shall the
penalty be a fine, and imprisonment until the fine is paid? there is the
same objection. i should have to lie in prison, for money i have none,
and cannot pay. and if i say exile (and this may possibly be the penalty
which you will affix), i must indeed be blinded by the love of life, if
i am so irrational as to expect that when you, who are my own citizens,
cannot endure my discourses and words, and have found them so grievous
and odious that you will have no more of them, others are likely to
endure me. no indeed, men of athens, that is not very likely. and what
a life should i lead, at my age, wandering from city to city, ever
changing my place of exile, and always being driven out! for i am quite
sure that wherever i go, there, as here, the young men will flock to
me; and if i drive them away, their elders will drive me out at their
request; and if i let them come, their fathers and friends will drive me
out for their sakes.

some one will say: yes, socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue, and
then you may go into a foreign city, and no one will interfere with you?
now i have great difficulty in making you understand my answer to this.
for if i tell you that to do as you say would be a disobedience to the
god, and therefore that i cannot hold my tongue, you will not believe
that i am serious; and if i say again that daily to discourse about
virtue, and of those other things about which you hear me examining
myself and others, is the greatest good of man, and that the unexamined
life is not worth living, you are still less likely to believe me. yet
i say what is true, although a thing of which it is hard for me to
persuade you. also, i have never been accustomed to think that i deserve
to suffer any harm. had i money i might have estimated the offence at
what i was able to pay, and not have been much the worse. but i have
none, and therefore i must ask you to proportion the fine to my means.
well, perhaps i could afford a mina, and therefore i propose that
penalty: plato, crito, critobulus, and apollodorus, my friends here, bid
me say thirty minae, and they will be the sureties. let thirty minae be
the penalty; for which sum they will be ample security to you.

*****

not much time will be gained, o athenians, in return for the evil name
which you will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that
you killed socrates, a wise man; for they will call me wise, even
although i am not wise, when they want to reproach you. if you had
waited a little while, your desire would have been fulfilled in the
course of nature. for i am far advanced in years, as you may perceive,
and not far from death. i am speaking now not to all of you, but only to
those who have condemned me to death. and i have another thing to say to
them: you think that i was convicted because i had no words of the sort
which would have procured my acquittal--i mean, if i had thought fit to
leave nothing undone or unsaid. not so; the deficiency which led to my
conviction was not of words--certainly not. but i had not the boldness
or impudence or inclination to address you as you would have liked me to
do, weeping and wailing and lamenting, and saying and doing many things
which you have been accustomed to hear from others, and which, as i
maintain, are unworthy of me. i thought at the time that i ought not to
do anything common or mean when in danger: nor do i now repent of the
style of my defence; i would rather die having spoken after my manner,
than speak in your manner and live. for neither in war nor yet at law
ought i or any man to use every way of escaping death. often in battle
there can be no doubt that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall
on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death; and in other
dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing to
say and do anything. the difficulty, my friends, is not to avoid death,
but to avoid unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death. i am old
and move slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken me, and my accusers
are keen and quick, and the faster runner, who is unrighteousness, has
overtaken them. and now i depart hence condemned by you to suffer the
penalty of death,--they too go their ways condemned by the truth
to suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong; and i must abide by my
award--let them abide by theirs. i suppose that these things may be
regarded as fated,--and i think that they are well.

and now, o men who have condemned me, i would fain prophesy to you;
for i am about to die, and in the hour of death men are gifted with
prophetic power. and i prophesy to you who are my murderers, that
immediately after my departure punishment far heavier than you have
inflicted on me will surely await you. me you have killed because you
wanted to escape the accuser, and not to give an account of your lives.
but that will not be as you suppose: far otherwise. for i say that there
will be more accusers of you than there are now; accusers whom
hitherto i have restrained: and as they are younger they will be more
inconsiderate with you, and you will be more offended at them. if you
think that by killing men you can prevent some one from censuring your
evil lives, you are mistaken; that is not a way of escape which is
either possible or honourable; the easiest and the noblest way is not
to be disabling others, but to be improving yourselves. this is the
prophecy which i utter before my departure to the judges who have
condemned me.

friends, who would have acquitted me, i would like also to talk with you
about the thing which has come to pass, while the magistrates are busy,
and before i go to the place at which i must die. stay then a little,
for we may as well talk with one another while there is time. you are my
friends, and i should like to show you the meaning of this event which
has happened to me. o my judges--for you i may truly call judges--i
should like to tell you of a wonderful circumstance. hitherto the divine
faculty of which the internal oracle is the source has constantly been
in the habit of opposing me even about trifles, if i was going to make
a slip or error in any matter; and now as you see there has come upon me
that which may be thought, and is generally believed to be, the last and
worst evil. but the oracle made no sign of opposition, either when i was
leaving my house in the morning, or when i was on my way to the court,
or while i was speaking, at anything which i was going to say; and yet i
have often been stopped in the middle of a speech, but now in nothing
i either said or did touching the matter in hand has the oracle opposed
me. what do i take to be the explanation of this silence? i will tell
you. it is an intimation that what has happened to me is a good, and
that those of us who think that death is an evil are in error. for the
customary sign would surely have opposed me had i been going to evil and
not to good.

let us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great
reason to hope that death is a good; for one of two things--either death
is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say,
there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another.
now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like
the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by dreams, death will be an
unspeakable gain. for if a person were to select the night in which his
sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the
other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many
days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more
pleasantly than this one, i think that any man, i will not say a private
man, but even the great king will not find many such days or nights,
when compared with the others. now if death be of such a nature, i say
that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single night. but if
death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the
dead abide, what good, o my friends and judges, can be greater than
this? if indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world below, he is
delivered from the professors of justice in this world, and finds the
true judges who are said to give judgment there, minos and rhadamanthus
and aeacus and triptolemus, and other sons of god who were righteous in
their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth making. what would not a
man give if he might converse with orpheus and musaeus and hesiod and
homer? nay, if this be true, let me die again and again. i myself, too,
shall have a wonderful interest in there meeting and conversing with
palamedes, and ajax the son of telamon, and any other ancient hero who
has suffered death through an unjust judgment; and there will be no
small pleasure, as i think, in comparing my own sufferings with theirs.
above all, i shall then be able to continue my search into true and
false knowledge; as in this world, so also in the next; and i shall find
out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise, and is not. what would
not a man give, o judges, to be able to examine the leader of the great
trojan expedition; or odysseus or sisyphus, or numberless others, men
and women too! what infinite delight would there be in conversing with
them and asking them questions! in another world they do not put a man
to death for asking questions: assuredly not. for besides being happier
than we are, they will be immortal, if what is said is true.

wherefore, o judges, be of good cheer about death, and know of a
certainty, that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or
after death. he and his are not neglected by the gods; nor has my own
approaching end happened by mere chance. but i see clearly that the
time had arrived when it was better for me to die and be released from
trouble; wherefore the oracle gave no sign. for which reason, also, i am
not angry with my condemners, or with my accusers; they have done me no
harm, although they did not mean to do me any good; and for this i may
gently blame them.

still i have a favour to ask of them. when my sons are grown up, i would
ask you, o my friends, to punish them; and i would have you trouble
them, as i have troubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or
anything, more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be something
when they are really nothing,--then reprove them, as i have reproved
you, for not caring about that for which they ought to care, and
thinking that they are something when they are really nothing. and
if you do this, both i and my sons will have received justice at your
hands.

the hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways--i to die, and you
to live. which is better god only knows.

section 1.

socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic. he lightly
touches upon a few points,--the division of labour and distribution
of the citizens into classes, the double nature and training of the
guardians, the community of property and of women and children. but
he makes no mention of the second education, or of the government of
philosophers.

and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion; he would like
to know how she behaved in some great struggle. but he is unable to
invent such a narrative himself; and he is afraid that the poets are
equally incapable; for, although he pretends to have nothing to say
against them, he remarks that they are a tribe of imitators, who can
only describe what they have seen. and he fears that the sophists, who
are plentifully supplied with graces of speech, in their erratic way of
life having never had a city or house of their own, may through want of
experience err in their conception of philosophers and statesmen. 'and
therefore to you i turn, timaeus, citizen of locris, who are at once
a philosopher and a statesman, and to you, critias, whom all athenians
know to be similarly accomplished, and to hermocrates, who is also
fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse.'

hermocrates: 'we will do our best, and have been already preparing; for
on our way home, critias told us of an ancient tradition, which i
wish, critias, that you would repeat to socrates.' 'i will, if timaeus
approves.' 'i approve.' listen then, socrates, to a tale of solon's,
who, being the friend of dropidas my great-grandfather, told it to my
grandfather critias, and he told me. the narrative related to ancient
famous actions of the athenian people, and to one especially, which i
will rehearse in honour of you and of the goddess. critias when he told
this tale of the olden time, was ninety years old, i being not more than
ten. the occasion of the rehearsal was the day of the apaturia called
the registration of youth, at which our parents gave prizes for
recitation. some poems of solon were recited by the boys. they had not
at that time gone out of fashion, and the recital of them led some one
to say, perhaps in compliment to critias, that solon was not only the
wisest of men but also the best of poets. the old man brightened up
at hearing this, and said: had solon only had the leisure which was
required to complete the famous legend which he brought with him from
egypt he would have been as distinguished as homer and hesiod. 'and what
was the subject of the poem?' said the person who made the remark. the
subject was a very noble one; he described the most famous action in
which the athenian people were ever engaged. but the memory of their
exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction
of the actors. 'tell us,' said the other, 'the whole story, and where
solon heard the story.' he replied--there is at the head of the egyptian
delta, where the river nile divides, a city and district called sais;
the city was the birthplace of king amasis, and is under the protection
of the goddess neith or athene. the citizens have a friendly feeling
towards the athenians, believing themselves to be related to them.
hither came solon, and was received with honour; and here he first
learnt, by conversing with the egyptian priests, how ignorant he and
his countrymen were of antiquity. perceiving this, and with the view of
eliciting information from them, he told them the tales of phoroneus and
niobe, and also of deucalion and pyrrha, and he endeavoured to count
the generations which had since passed. thereupon an aged priest said to
him: 'o solon, solon, you hellenes are ever young, and there is no old
man who is a hellene.' 'what do you mean?' he asked. 'in mind,' replied
the priest, 'i mean to say that you are children; there is no opinion
or tradition of knowledge among you which is white with age; and i
will tell you why. like the rest of mankind you have suffered from
convulsions of nature, which are chiefly brought about by the two great
agencies of fire and water. the former is symbolized in the hellenic
tale of young phaethon who drove his father's horses the wrong way, and
having burnt up the earth was himself burnt up by a thunderbolt. for
there occurs at long intervals a derangement of the heavenly bodies, and
then the earth is destroyed by fire. at such times, and when fire is the
agent, those who dwell by rivers or on the seashore are safer than those
who dwell upon high and dry places, who in their turn are safer when
the danger is from water. now the nile is our saviour from fire, and as
there is little rain in egypt, we are not harmed by water; whereas in
other countries, when a deluge comes, the inhabitants are swept by the
rivers into the sea. the memorials which your own and other nations
have once had of the famous actions of mankind perish in the waters at
certain periods; and the rude survivors in the mountains begin again,
knowing nothing of the world before the flood. but in egypt the
traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in
our temples. the genealogies which you have recited to us out of your
own annals, solon, are a mere children's story. for in the first place,
you remember one deluge only, and there were many of them, and you know
nothing of that fairest and noblest race of which you are a seed or
remnant. the memory of them was lost, because there was no written
voice among you. for in the times before the great flood athens was the
greatest and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best
constitution of any under the face of heaven.' solon marvelled, and
desired to be informed of the particulars. 'you are welcome to hear
them,' said the priest, 'both for your own sake and for that of the
city, and above all for the sake of the goddess who is the common
foundress of both our cities. nine thousand years have elapsed since she
founded yours, and eight thousand since she founded ours, as our annals
record. many laws exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as
they were in the olden time. i will briefly describe them to you,
and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred
registers. in the first place, there was a caste of priests among the
ancient athenians, and another of artisans; also castes of shepherds,
hunters, and husbandmen, and lastly of warriors, who, like the warriors
of egypt, were separated from the rest, and carried shields and spears,
a custom which the goddess first taught you, and then the asiatics, and
we among asiatics first received from her. observe again, what care the
law took in the pursuit of wisdom, searching out the deep things of the
world, and applying them to the use of man. the spot of earth which the
goddess chose had the best of climates, and produced the wisest men; in
no other was she herself, the philosopher and warrior goddess, so likely
to have votaries. and there you dwelt as became the children of the
gods, excelling all men in virtue, and many famous actions are recorded
of you. the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of
atlantis. this great island lay over against the pillars of heracles, in
extent greater than libya and asia put together, and was the passage to
other islands and to a great ocean of which the mediterranean sea was
only the harbour; and within the pillars the empire of atlantis reached
in europe to tyrrhenia and in libya to egypt. this mighty power was
arrayed against egypt and hellas and all the countries bordering on the
mediterranean. then your city did bravely, and won renown over the
whole earth. for at the peril of her own existence, and when the other
hellenes had deserted her, she repelled the invader, and of her own
accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars. a little
while afterwards there were great earthquakes and floods, and your
warrior race all sank into the earth; and the great island of atlantis
also disappeared in the sea. this is the explanation of the shallows
which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean.'

such was the tale, socrates, which critias heard from solon; and i
noticed when listening to you yesterday, how close the resemblance was
between your city and citizens and the ancient athenian state. but i
would not speak at the time, because i wanted to refresh my memory.
i had heard the old man when i was a child, and though i could not
remember the whole of our yesterday's discourse, i was able to recall
every word of this, which is branded into my mind; and i am prepared,
socrates, to rehearse to you the entire narrative. the imaginary state
which you were describing may be identified with the reality of solon,
and our antediluvian ancestors may be your citizens. 'that is excellent,
critias, and very appropriate to a panathenaic festival; the truth of
the story is a great advantage.' then now let me explain to you
the order of our entertainment; first, timaeus, who is a natural
philosopher, will speak of the origin of the world, going down to the
creation of man, and then i shall receive the men whom he has created,
and some of whom will have been educated by you, and introduce them to
you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record spoke.
as the law of solon prescribes, we will bring them into court and
acknowledge their claims to citizenship. 'i see,' replied socrates,
'that i shall be well entertained; and do you, timaeus, offer up a
prayer and begin.'

timaeus: all men who have any right feeling, at the beginning of any
enterprise, call upon the gods; and he who is about to speak of the
origin of the universe has a special need of their aid. may my words
be acceptable to them, and may i speak in the manner which will be most
intelligible to you and will best express my own meaning!

first, i must distinguish between that which always is and never becomes
and which is apprehended by reason and reflection, and that which always
becomes and never is and is conceived by opinion with the help of sense.
all that becomes and is created is the work of a cause, and that is
fair which the artificer makes after an eternal pattern, but whatever is
fashioned after a created pattern is not fair. is the world created or
uncreated?--that is the first question. created, i reply, being visible
and tangible and having a body, and therefore sensible; and if sensible,
then created; and if created, made by a cause, and the cause is the
ineffable father of all things, who had before him an eternal archetype.
for to imagine that the archetype was created would be blasphemy, seeing
that the world is the noblest of creations, and god is the best of
causes. and the world being thus created according to the eternal
pattern is the copy of something; and we may assume that words are akin
to the matter of which they speak. what is spoken of the unchanging or
intelligible must be certain and true; but what is spoken of the created
image can only be probable; being is to becoming what truth is to
belief. and amid the variety of opinions which have arisen about god and
the nature of the world we must be content to take probability for
our rule, considering that i, who am the speaker, and you, who are the
judges, are only men; to probability we may attain but no further.

socrates: excellent, timaeus, i like your manner of approaching the
subject--proceed.

timaeus: why did the creator make the world?...he was good, and
therefore not jealous, and being free from jealousy he desired that all
things should be like himself. wherefore he set in order the visible
world, which he found in disorder. now he who is the best could
only create the fairest; and reflecting that of visible things the
intelligent is superior to the unintelligent, he put intelligence
in soul and soul in body, and framed the universe to be the best and
fairest work in the order of nature, and the world became a living soul
through the providence of god.

in the likeness of what animal was the world made?--that is the third
question...the form of the perfect animal was a whole, and contained all
intelligible beings, and the visible animal, made after the pattern of
this, included all visible creatures.

are there many worlds or one only?--that is the fourth question...one
only. for if in the original there had been more than one they would
have been the parts of a third, which would have been the true pattern
of the world; and therefore there is, and will ever be, but one created
world. now that which is created is of necessity corporeal and visible
and tangible,--visible and therefore made of fire,--tangible and
therefore solid and made of earth. but two terms must be united by a
third, which is a mean between them; and had the earth been a surface
only, one mean would have sufficed, but two means are required to unite
solid bodies. and as the world was composed of solids, between the
elements of fire and earth god placed two other elements of air and
water, and arranged them in a continuous proportion--

fire:air::air:water, and air:water::water:earth,

and so put together a visible and palpable heaven, having harmony and
friendship in the union of the four elements; and being at unity with
itself it was indissoluble except by the hand of the framer. each of the
elements was taken into the universe whole and entire; for he considered
that the animal should be perfect and one, leaving no remnants out of
which another animal could be created, and should also be free from old
age and disease, which are produced by the action of external forces.
and as he was to contain all things, he was made in the all-containing
form of a sphere, round as from a lathe and every way equidistant from
the centre, as was natural and suitable to him. he was finished and
smooth, having neither eyes nor ears, for there was nothing without
him which he could see or hear; and he had no need to carry food to
his mouth, nor was there air for him to breathe; and he did not require
hands, for there was nothing of which he could take hold, nor feet, with
which to walk. all that he did was done rationally in and by himself,
and he moved in a circle turning within himself, which is the most
intellectual of motions; but the other six motions were wanting to him;
wherefore the universe had no feet or legs.

and so the thought of god made a god in the image of a perfect body,
having intercourse with himself and needing no other, but in every part
harmonious and self-contained and truly blessed. the soul was first made
by him--the elder to rule the younger; not in the order in which our
wayward fancy has led us to describe them, but the soul first and
afterwards the body. god took of the unchangeable and indivisible and
also of the divisible and corporeal, and out of the two he made a third
nature, essence, which was in a mean between them, and partook of the
same and the other, the intractable nature of the other being compressed
into the same. having made a compound of all the three, he proceeded
to divide the entire mass into portions related to one another in the
ratios of 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27, and proceeded to fill up the double and
triple intervals thus--

  - over 1, 4/3, 3/2, - over 2, 8/3, 3, - over 4, 16/3, 6,  - over 8:
  - over 1, 3/2, 2,   - over 3, 9/2, 6, - over 9, 27/2, 18, - over 27;

in which double series of numbers are two kinds of means; the one
exceeds and is exceeded by equal parts of the extremes, e.g. 1, 4/3, 2;
the other kind of mean is one which is equidistant from the extremes--2,
4, 6. in this manner there were formed intervals of thirds, 3:2, of
fourths, 4:3, and of ninths, 9:8. and next he filled up the intervals
of a fourth with ninths, leaving a remnant which is in the ratio of
256:243. the entire compound was divided by him lengthways into two
parts, which he united at the centre like the letter x, and bent into an
inner and outer circle or sphere, cutting one another again at a point
over against the point at which they cross. the outer circle or sphere
was named the sphere of the same--the inner, the sphere of the other
or diverse; and the one revolved horizontally to the right, the other
diagonally to the left. to the sphere of the same which was undivided
he gave dominion, but the sphere of the other or diverse was distributed
into seven unequal orbits, having intervals in ratios of twos and
threes, three of either sort, and he bade the orbits move in opposite
directions to one another--three of them, the sun, mercury, venus,
with equal swiftness, and the remaining four--the moon, saturn, mars,
jupiter, with unequal swiftness to the three and to one another, but all
in due proportion.

when the creator had made the soul he made the body within her; and
the soul interfused everywhere from the centre to the circumference of
heaven, herself turning in herself, began a divine life of rational
and everlasting motion. the body of heaven is visible, but the soul
is invisible, and partakes of reason and harmony, and is the best of
creations, being the work of the best. and being composed of the same,
the other, and the essence, these three, and also divided and bound
in harmonical proportion, and revolving within herself--the soul when
touching anything which has essence, whether divided or undivided, is
stirred to utter the sameness or diversity of that and some other thing,
and to tell how and when and where individuals are affected or related,
whether in the world of change or of essence. when reason is in the
neighbourhood of sense, and the circle of the other or diverse is moving
truly, then arise true opinions and beliefs; when reason is in the
sphere of thought, and the circle of the same runs smoothly, then
intelligence is perfected.

when the father who begat the world saw the image which he had made
of the eternal gods moving and living, he rejoiced; and in his joy
resolved, since the archetype was eternal, to make the creature eternal
as far as this was possible. wherefore he made an image of eternity
which is time, having an uniform motion according to number, parted into
months and days and years, and also having greater divisions of past,
present, and future. these all apply to becoming in time, and have no
meaning in relation to the eternal nature, which ever is and never was
or will be; for the unchangeable is never older or younger, and when
we say that he 'was' or 'will be,' we are mistaken, for these words are
applicable only to becoming, and not to true being; and equally wrong
are we in saying that what has become is become and that what becomes
is becoming, and that the non-existent is non-existent...these are the
forms of time which imitate eternity and move in a circle measured by
number.

thus was time made in the image of the eternal nature; and it was
created together with the heavens, in order that if they were dissolved,
it might perish with them. and god made the sun and moon and five other
wanderers, as they are called, seven in all, and to each of them he gave
a body moving in an orbit, being one of the seven orbits into which the
circle of the other was divided. he put the moon in the orbit which was
nearest to the earth, the sun in that next, the morning star and
mercury in the orbits which move opposite to the sun but with equal
swiftness--this being the reason why they overtake and are overtaken by
one another. all these bodies became living creatures, and learnt their
appointed tasks, and began to move, the nearer more swiftly, the remoter
more slowly, according to the diagonal movement of the other. and since
this was controlled by the movement of the same, the seven planets in
their courses appeared to describe spirals; and that appeared fastest
which was slowest, and that which overtook others appeared to be
overtaken by them. and god lighted a fire in the second orbit from the
earth which is called the sun, to give light over the whole heaven, and
to teach intelligent beings that knowledge of number which is derived
from the revolution of the same. thus arose day and night, which are
the periods of the most intelligent nature; a month is created by the
revolution of the moon, a year by that of the sun. other periods of
wonderful length and complexity are not observed by men in general;
there is moreover a cycle or perfect year at the completion of which
they all meet and coincide...to this end the stars came into being, that
the created heaven might imitate the eternal nature.

thus far the universal animal was made in the divine image, but the
other animals were not as yet included in him. and god created them
according to the patterns or species of them which existed in the divine
original. there are four of them: one of gods, another of birds, a third
of fishes, and a fourth of animals. the gods were made in the form of a
circle, which is the most perfect figure and the figure of the universe.
they were created chiefly of fire, that they might be bright, and were
made to know and follow the best, and to be scattered over the heavens,
of which they were to be the glory. two kinds of motion were assigned to
them--first, the revolution in the same and around the same, in peaceful
unchanging thought of the same; and to this was added a forward motion
which was under the control of the same. thus then the fixed stars were
created, being divine and eternal animals, revolving on the same spot,
and the wandering stars, in their courses, were created in the manner
already described. the earth, which is our nurse, clinging around the
pole extended through the universe, he made to be the guardian and
artificer of night and day, first and eldest of gods that are in the
interior of heaven. vain would be the labour of telling all the
figures of them, moving as in dance, and their juxta-positions and
approximations, and when and where and behind what other stars they
appear to disappear--to tell of all this without looking at a plan of
them would be labour in vain.

the knowledge of the other gods is beyond us, and we can only accept the
traditions of the ancients, who were the children of the gods, as they
said; for surely they must have known their own ancestors. although they
give no proof, we must believe them as is customary. they tell us that
oceanus and tethys were the children of earth and heaven; that phoreys,
cronos, and rhea came in the next generation, and were followed by zeus
and here, whose brothers and children are known to everybody.

when all of them, both those who show themselves in the sky, and those
who retire from view, had come into being, the creator addressed them
thus:--'gods, sons of gods, my works, if i will, are indissoluble. that
which is bound may be dissolved, but only an evil being would dissolve
that which is harmonious and happy. and although you are not immortal
you shall not die, for i will hold you together. hear me, then:--three
tribes of mortal beings have still to be created, but if created by me
they would be like gods. do ye therefore make them; i will implant in
them the seed of immortality, and you shall weave together the mortal
and immortal, and provide food for them, and receive them again in
death.' thus he spake, and poured the remains of the elements into
the cup in which he had mingled the soul of the universe. they were no
longer pure as before, but diluted; and the mixture he distributed into
souls equal in number to the stars, and assigned each to a star--then
having mounted them, as in a chariot, he showed them the nature of the
universe, and told them of their future birth and human lot. they were
to be sown in the planets, and out of them was to come forth the most
religious of animals, which would hereafter be called man. the souls
were to be implanted in bodies, which were in a perpetual flux, whence,
he said, would arise, first, sensation; secondly, love, which is a
mixture of pleasure and pain; thirdly, fear and anger, and the opposite
affections: and if they conquered these, they would live righteously,
but if they were conquered by them, unrighteously. he who lived
well would return to his native star, and would there have a blessed
existence; but, if he lived ill, he would pass into the nature of a
woman, and if he did not then alter his evil ways, into the likeness of
some animal, until the reason which was in him reasserted her sway over
the elements of fire, air, earth, water, which had engrossed her, and
he regained his first and better nature. having given this law to his
creatures, that he might be guiltless of their future evil, he sowed
them, some in the earth, some in the moon, and some in the other
planets; and he ordered the younger gods to frame human bodies for them
and to make the necessary additions to them, and to avert from them all
but self-inflicted evil.

having given these commands, the creator remained in his own nature. and
his children, receiving from him the immortal principle, borrowed from
the world portions of earth, air, fire, water, hereafter to be returned,
which they fastened together, not with the adamantine bonds which bound
themselves, but by little invisible pegs, making each separate body out
of all the elements, subject to influx and efflux, and containing the
courses of the soul. these swelling and surging as in a river moved
irregularly and irrationally in all the six possible ways, forwards,
backwards, right, left, up and down. but violent as were the internal
and alimentary fluids, the tide became still more violent when the body
came into contact with flaming fire, or the solid earth, or gliding
waters, or the stormy wind; the motions produced by these impulses pass
through the body to the soul and have the name of sensations. uniting
with the ever-flowing current, they shake the courses of the soul,
stopping the revolution of the same and twisting in all sorts of ways
the nature of the other, and the harmonical ratios of twos and threes
and the mean terms which connect them, until the circles are bent
and disordered and their motion becomes irregular. you may imagine a
position of the body in which the head is resting upon the ground, and
the legs are in the air, and the top is bottom and the left right. and
something similar happens when the disordered motions of the soul come
into contact with any external thing; they say the same or the other in
a manner which is the very opposite of the truth, and they are false
and foolish, and have no guiding principle in them. and when external
impressions enter in, they are really conquered, though they seem to
conquer.

by reason of these affections the soul is at first without intelligence,
but as time goes on the stream of nutriment abates, and the courses
of the soul regain their proper motion, and apprehend the same and the
other rightly, and become rational. the soul of him who has education
is whole and perfect and escapes the worst disease, but, if a man's
education be neglected, he walks lamely through life and returns good
for nothing to the world below. this, however, is an after-stage--at
present, we are only concerned with the creation of the body and soul.

the two divine courses were encased by the gods in a sphere which is
called the head, and is the god and lord of us. and to this they gave
the body to be a vehicle, and the members to be instruments, having the
power of flexion and extension. such was the origin of legs and arms.
in the next place, the gods gave a forward motion to the human body,
because the front part of man was the more honourable and had authority.
and they put in a face in which they inserted organs to minister in all
things to the providence of the soul. they first contrived the eyes,
into which they conveyed a light akin to the light of day, making it
flow through the pupils. when the light of the eye is surrounded by the
light of day, then like falls upon like, and they unite and form one
body which conveys to the soul the motions of visible objects. but when
the visual ray goes forth into the darkness, then unlike falls upon
unlike--the eye no longer sees, and we go to sleep. the fire or light,
when kept in by the eyelids, equalizes the inward motions, and there
is rest accompanied by few dreams; only when the greater motions remain
they engender in us corresponding visions of the night. and now we shall
be able to understand the nature of reflections in mirrors. the fires
from within and from without meet about the smooth and bright surface
of the mirror; and because they meet in a manner contrary to the usual
mode, the right and left sides of the object are transposed. in
a concave mirror the top and bottom are inverted, but this is no
transposition.

these are the second causes which god used as his ministers in
fashioning the world. they are thought by many to be the prime causes,
but they are not so; for they are destitute of mind and reason, and the
lover of mind will not allow that there are any prime causes other
than the rational and invisible ones--these he investigates first, and
afterwards the causes of things which are moved by others, and which
work by chance and without order. of the second or concurrent causes of
sight i have already spoken, and i will now speak of the higher purpose
of god in giving us eyes. sight is the source of the greatest benefits
to us; for if our eyes had never seen the sun, stars, and heavens, the
words which we have spoken would not have been uttered. the sight of
them and their revolutions has given us the knowledge of number and
time, the power of enquiry, and philosophy, which is the great blessing
of human life; not to speak of the lesser benefits which even the vulgar
can appreciate. god gave us the faculty of sight that we might behold
the order of the heavens and create a corresponding order in our own
erring minds. to the like end the gifts of speech and hearing were
bestowed upon us; not for the sake of irrational pleasure, but in order
that we might harmonize the courses of the soul by sympathy with the
harmony of sound, and cure ourselves of our irregular and graceless
ways.

thus far we have spoken of the works of mind; and there are other
works done from necessity, which we must now place beside them; for
the creation is made up of both, mind persuading necessity as far as
possible to work out good. before the heavens there existed fire, air,
water, earth, which we suppose men to know, though no one has explained
their nature, and we erroneously maintain them to be the letters or
elements of the whole, although they cannot reasonably be compared even
to syllables or first compounds. i am not now speaking of the first
principles of things, because i cannot discover them by our present mode
of enquiry. but as i observed the rule of probability at first, i will
begin anew, seeking by the grace of god to observe it still.

in our former discussion i distinguished two kinds of being--the
unchanging or invisible, and the visible or changing. but now a
third kind is required, which i shall call the receptacle or nurse of
generation. there is a difficulty in arriving at an exact notion of this
third kind, because the four elements themselves are of inexact natures
and easily pass into one another, and are too transient to be detained
by any one name; wherefore we are compelled to speak of water or fire,
not as substances, but as qualities. they may be compared to images made
of gold, which are continually assuming new forms. somebody asks what
they are; if you do not know, the safest answer is to reply that they
are gold. in like manner there is a universal nature out of which all
things are made, and which is like none of them; but they enter into and
pass out of her, and are made after patterns of the true in a wonderful
and inexplicable manner. the containing principle may be likened to a
mother, the source or spring to a father, the intermediate nature to
a child; and we may also remark that the matter which receives every
variety of form must be formless, like the inodorous liquids which are
prepared to receive scents, or the smooth and soft materials on which
figures are impressed. in the same way space or matter is neither earth
nor fire nor air nor water, but an invisible and formless being which
receives all things, and in an incomprehensible manner partakes of the
intelligible. but we may say, speaking generally, that fire is that part
of this nature which is inflamed, water that which is moistened, and the
like.

let me ask a question in which a great principle is involved: is there
an essence of fire and the other elements, or are there only fires
visible to sense? i answer in a word: if mind is one thing and true
opinion another, then there are self-existent essences; but if mind is
the same with opinion, then the visible and corporeal is most real. but
they are not the same, and they have a different origin and nature.
the one comes to us by instruction, the other by persuasion, the one is
rational, the other is irrational; the one is movable by persuasion,
the other immovable; the one is possessed by every man, the other by the
gods and by very few men. and we must acknowledge that as there are two
kinds of knowledge, so there are two kinds of being corresponding to
them; the one uncreated, indestructible, immovable, which is seen by
intelligence only; the other created, which is always becoming in place
and vanishing out of place, and is apprehended by opinion and sense.
there is also a third nature--that of space, which is indestructible,
and is perceived by a kind of spurious reason without the help of
sense. this is presented to us in a dreamy manner, and yet is said to
be necessary, for we say that all things must be somewhere in space. for
they are the images of other things and must therefore have a separate
existence and exist in something (i.e. in space). but true reason
assures us that while two things (i.e. the idea and the image) are
different they cannot inhere in one another, so as to be one and two at
the same time.

to sum up: being and generation and space, these three, existed before
the heavens, and the nurse or vessel of generation, moistened by water
and inflamed by fire, and taking the forms of air and earth, assumed
various shapes. by the motion of the vessel, the elements were divided,
and like grain winnowed by fans, the close and heavy particles settled
in one place, the light and airy ones in another. at first they were
without reason and measure, and had only certain faint traces of
themselves, until god fashioned them by figure and number. in this, as
in every other part of creation, i suppose god to have made things, as
far as was possible, fair and good, out of things not fair and good.

and now i will explain to you the generation of the world by a method
with which your scientific training will have made you familiar. fire,
air, earth, and water are bodies and therefore solids, and solids
are contained in planes, and plane rectilinear figures are made up of
triangles. of triangles there are two kinds; one having the opposite
sides equal (isosceles), the other with unequal sides (scalene). these
we may fairly assume to be the original elements of fire and the other
bodies; what principles are prior to these god only knows, and he of men
whom god loves. next, we must determine what are the four most beautiful
figures which are unlike one another and yet sometimes capable of
resolution into one another...of the two kinds of triangles the
equal-sided has but one form, the unequal-sided has an infinite variety
of forms; and there is none more beautiful than that which forms the
half of an equilateral triangle. let us then choose two triangles; one,
the isosceles, the other, that form of scalene which has the square of
the longer side three times as great as the square of the lesser side;
and affirm that, out of these, fire and the other elements have been
constructed.

i was wrong in imagining that all the four elements could be generated
into and out of one another. for as they are formed, three of them from
the triangle which has the sides unequal, the fourth from the triangle
which has equal sides, three can be resolved into one another, but the
fourth cannot be resolved into them nor they into it. so much for their
passage into one another: i must now speak of their construction. from
the triangle of which the hypotenuse is twice the lesser side the three
first regular solids are formed--first, the equilateral pyramid or
tetrahedron; secondly, the octahedron; thirdly, the icosahedron; and
from the isosceles triangle is formed the cube. and there is a fifth
figure (which is made out of twelve pentagons), the dodecahedron--this
god used as a model for the twelvefold division of the zodiac.

let us now assign the geometrical forms to their respective elements.
the cube is the most stable of them because resting on a quadrangular
plane surface, and composed of isosceles triangles. to the earth then,
which is the most stable of bodies and the most easily modelled of them,
may be assigned the form of a cube; and the remaining forms to the other
elements,--to fire the pyramid, to air the octahedron, and to water the
icosahedron,--according to their degrees of lightness or heaviness or
power, or want of power, of penetration. the single particles of any of
the elements are not seen by reason of their smallness; they only become
visible when collected. the ratios of their motions, numbers, and
other properties, are ordered by the god, who harmonized them as far as
necessity permitted.

the probable conclusion is as follows:--earth, when dissolved by the
more penetrating element of fire, whether acting immediately or through
the medium of air or water, is decomposed but not transformed. water,
when divided by fire or air, becomes one part fire, and two parts air.
a volume of air divided becomes two of fire. on the other hand, when
condensed, two volumes of fire make a volume of air; and two and a half
parts of air condense into one of water. any element which is fastened
upon by fire is cut by the sharpness of the triangles, until at length,
coalescing with the fire, it is at rest; for similars are not affected
by similars. when two kinds of bodies quarrel with one another, then the
tendency to decomposition continues until the smaller either escapes to
its kindred element or becomes one with its conqueror. and this tendency
in bodies to condense or escape is a source of motion...where there is
motion there must be a mover, and where there is a mover there must be
something to move. these cannot exist in what is uniform, and therefore
motion is due to want of uniformity. but then why, when things are
divided after their kinds, do they not cease from motion? the answer is,
that the circular motion of all things compresses them, and as 'nature
abhors a vacuum,' the finer and more subtle particles of the lighter
elements, such as fire and air, are thrust into the interstices of the
larger, each of them penetrating according to their rarity, and thus
all the elements are on their way up and down everywhere and always
into their own places. hence there is a principle of inequality, and
therefore of motion, in all time.

in the next place, we may observe that there are different kinds of
fire--(1) flame, (2) light that burns not, (3) the red heat of the
embers of fire. and there are varieties of air, as for example, the pure
aether, the opaque mist, and other nameless forms. water, again, is
of two kinds, liquid and fusile. the liquid is composed of small and
unequal particles, the fusile of large and uniform particles and is more
solid, but nevertheless melts at the approach of fire, and then spreads
upon the earth. when the substance cools, the fire passes into the air,
which is displaced, and forces together and condenses the liquid mass.
this process is called cooling and congealment. of the fusile kinds the
fairest and heaviest is gold; this is hardened by filtration through
rock, and is of a bright yellow colour. a shoot of gold which is darker
and denser than the rest is called adamant. another kind is called
copper, which is harder and yet lighter because the interstices are
larger than in gold. there is mingled with it a fine and small portion
of earth which comes out in the form of rust. these are a few of the
conjectures which philosophy forms, when, leaving the eternal nature,
she turns for innocent recreation to consider the truths of generation.

water which is mingled with fire is called liquid because it rolls
upon the earth, and soft because its bases give way. this becomes more
equable when separated from fire and air, and then congeals into hail or
ice, or the looser forms of hoar frost or snow. there are other waters
which are called juices and are distilled through plants. of these we
may mention, first, wine, which warms the soul as well as the body;
secondly, oily substances, as for example, oil or pitch; thirdly,
honey, which relaxes the contracted parts of the mouth and so produces
sweetness; fourthly, vegetable acid, which is frothy and has a burning
quality and dissolves the flesh. of the kinds of earth, that which is
filtered through water passes into stone; the water is broken up by the
earth and escapes in the form of air--this in turn presses upon the mass
of earth, and the earth, compressed into an indissoluble union with
the remaining water, becomes rock. rock, when it is made up of equal
particles, is fair and transparent, but the reverse when of unequal.
earth is converted into pottery when the watery part is suddenly drawn
away; or if moisture remains, the earth, when fused by fire, becomes,
on cooling, a stone of a black colour. when the earth is finer and of
a briny nature then two half-solid bodies are formed by separating the
water,--soda and salt. the strong compounds of earth and water are not
soluble by water, but only by fire. earth itself, when not consolidated,
is dissolved by water; when consolidated, by fire only. the cohesion of
water, when strong, is dissolved by fire only; when weak, either by air
or fire, the former entering the interstices, the latter penetrating
even the triangles. air when strongly condensed is indissoluble by any
power which does not reach the triangles, and even when not strongly
condensed is only resolved by fire. compounds of earth and water are
unaffected by water while the water occupies the interstices in them,
but begin to liquefy when fire enters into the interstices of the water.
they are of two kinds, some of them, like glass, having more earth,
others, like wax, having more water in them.

having considered objects of sense, we now pass on to sensation. but we
cannot explain sensation without explaining the nature of flesh and of
the mortal soul; and as we cannot treat of both together, in order that
we may proceed at once to the sensations we must assume the existence of
body and soul.

what makes fire burn? the fineness of the sides, the sharpness of the
angles, the smallness of the particles, the quickness of the motion.
moreover, the pyramid, which is the figure of fire, is more cutting than
any other. the feeling of cold is produced by the larger particles of
moisture outside the body trying to eject the smaller ones in the body
which they compress. the struggle which arises between elements thus
unnaturally brought together causes shivering. that is hard to which the
flesh yields, and soft which yields to the flesh, and these two terms
are also relative to one another. the yielding matter is that which
has the slenderest base, whereas that which has a rectangular base
is compact and repellent. light and heavy are wrongly explained with
reference to a lower and higher in place. for in the universe, which is
a sphere, there is no opposition of above or below, and that which is to
us above would be below to a man standing at the antipodes. the greater
or less difficulty in detaching any element from its like is the real
cause of heaviness or of lightness. if you draw the earth into the
dissimilar air, the particles of earth cling to their native element,
and you more easily detach a small portion than a large. there would
be the same difficulty in moving any of the upper elements towards the
lower. the smooth and the rough are severally produced by the union of
evenness with compactness, and of hardness with inequality.

pleasure and pain are the most important of the affections common to the
whole body. according to our general doctrine of sensation, parts of the
body which are easily moved readily transmit the motion to the mind; but
parts which are not easily moved have no effect upon the patient. the
bones and hair are of the latter kind, sight and hearing of the former.
ordinary affections are neither pleasant nor painful. the impressions
of sight afford an example of these, and are neither violent nor
sudden. but sudden replenishments of the body cause pleasure, and sudden
disturbances, as for example cuttings and burnings, have the opposite
effect.

>from sensations common to the whole body, we proceed to those of
particular parts. the affections of the tongue appear to be caused by
contraction and dilation, but they have more of roughness or smoothness
than is found in other affections. earthy particles, entering into the
small veins of the tongue which reach to the heart, when they melt into
and dry up the little veins are astringent if they are rough; or if
not so rough, they are only harsh, and if excessively abstergent, like
potash and soda, bitter. purgatives of a weaker sort are called salt
and, having no bitterness, are rather agreeable. inflammatory bodies,
which by their lightness are carried up into the head, cutting all that
comes in their way, are termed pungent. but when these are refined by
putrefaction, and enter the narrow veins of the tongue, and meet there
particles of earth and air, two kinds of globules are formed--one of
earthy and impure liquid, which boils and ferments, the other of pure
and transparent water, which are called bubbles; of all these affections
the cause is termed acid. when, on the other hand, the composition of
the deliquescent particles is congenial to the tongue, and disposes the
parts according to their nature, this remedial power in them is called
sweet.

smells are not divided into kinds; all of them are transitional, and
arise out of the decomposition of one element into another, for the
simple air or water is without smell. they are vapours or mists, thinner
than water and thicker than air: and hence in drawing in the breath,
when there is an obstruction, the air passes, but there is no smell.
they have no names, but are distinguished as pleasant and unpleasant,
and their influence extends over the whole region from the head to the
navel.

hearing is the effect of a stroke which is transmitted through the ears
by means of the air, brain, and blood to the soul, beginning at the head
and extending to the liver. the sound which moves swiftly is acute; that
which moves slowly is grave; that which is uniform is smooth, and the
opposite is harsh. loudness depends on the quantity of the sound. of the
harmony of sounds i will hereafter speak.

colours are flames which emanate from all bodies, having particles
corresponding to the sense of sight. some of the particles are less and
some larger, and some are equal to the parts of the sight. the equal
particles appear transparent; the larger contract, and the lesser dilate
the sight. white is produced by the dilation, black by the contraction,
of the particles of sight. there is also a swifter motion of another
sort of fire which forces a way through the passages of the eyes, and
elicits from them a union of fire and water which we call tears.
the inner fire flashes forth, and the outer finds a way in and is
extinguished in the moisture, and all sorts of colours are generated
by the mixture. this affection is termed by us dazzling, and the object
which produces it is called bright. there is yet another sort of
fire which mingles with the moisture of the eye without flashing, and
produces a colour like blood--to this we give the name of red. a bright
element mingling with red and white produces a colour which we call
auburn. the law of proportion, however, according to which compound
colours are formed, cannot be determined scientifically or even
probably. red, when mingled with black and white, gives a purple hue,
which becomes umber when the colours are burnt and there is a larger
admixture of black. flame-colour is a mixture of auburn and dun; dun of
white and black; yellow of white and auburn. white and bright meeting,
and falling upon a full black, become dark blue; dark blue mingling with
white becomes a light blue; the union of flame-colour and black makes
leek-green. there is no difficulty in seeing how other colours are
probably composed. but he who should attempt to test the truth of this
by experiment, would forget the difference of the human and divine
nature. god only is able to compound and resolve substances; such
experiments are impossible to man.

these are the elements of necessity which the creator received in
the world of generation when he made the all-sufficient and perfect
creature, using the secondary causes as his ministers, but himself
fashioning the good in all things. for there are two sorts of causes,
the one divine, the other necessary; and we should seek to discover the
divine above all, and, for their sake, the necessary, because without
them the higher cannot be attained by us.

having now before us the causes out of which the rest of our discourse
is to be framed, let us go back to the point at which we began, and
add a fair ending to our tale. as i said at first, all things were
originally a chaos in which there was no order or proportion. the
elements of this chaos were arranged by the creator, and out of them
he made the world. of the divine he himself was the author, but he
committed to his offspring the creation of the mortal. from him they
received the immortal soul, but themselves made the body to be its
vehicle, and constructed within another soul which was mortal, and
subject to terrible affections--pleasure, the inciter of evil; pain,
which deters from good; rashness and fear, foolish counsellors; anger
hard to be appeased; hope easily led astray. these they mingled with
irrational sense and all-daring love according to necessary laws and so
framed man. and, fearing to pollute the divine element, they gave the
mortal soul a separate habitation in the breast, parted off from the
head by a narrow isthmus. and as in a house the women's apartments are
divided from the men's, the cavity of the thorax was divided into two
parts, a higher and a lower. the higher of the two, which is the seat of
courage and anger, lies nearer to the head, between the midriff and the
neck, and assists reason in restraining the desires. the heart is the
house of guard in which all the veins meet, and through them reason
sends her commands to the extremity of her kingdom. when the passions
are in revolt, or danger approaches from without, then the heart beats
and swells; and the creating powers, knowing this, implanted in the
body the soft and bloodless substance of the lung, having a porous and
springy nature like a sponge, and being kept cool by drink and air which
enters through the trachea.

the part of the soul which desires meat and drink was placed between the
midriff and navel, where they made a sort of manger; and here they bound
it down, like a wild animal, away from the council-chamber, and leaving
the better principle undisturbed to advise quietly for the good of the
whole. for the creator knew that the belly would not listen to reason,
and was under the power of idols and fancies. wherefore he framed the
liver to connect with the lower nature, contriving that it should be
compact, and bright, and sweet, and also bitter and smooth, in order
that the power of thought which originates in the mind might there be
reflected, terrifying the belly with the elements of bitterness and
gall, and a suffusion of bilious colours when the liver is contracted,
and causing pain and misery by twisting out of its place the lobe and
closing up the vessels and gates. and the converse happens when some
gentle inspiration coming from intelligence mirrors the opposite
fancies, giving rest and sweetness and freedom, and at night, moderation
and peace accompanied with prophetic insight, when reason and sense are
asleep. for the authors of our being, in obedience to their father's
will and in order to make men as good as they could, gave to the liver
the power of divination, which is never active when men are awake or
in health; but when they are under the influence of some disorder or
enthusiasm then they receive intimations, which have to be interpreted
by others who are called prophets, but should rather be called
interpreters of prophecy; after death these intimations become
unintelligible. the spleen which is situated in the neighbourhood, on
the left side, keeps the liver bright and clean, as a napkin does a
mirror, and the evacuations of the liver are received into it; and being
a hollow tissue it is for a time swollen with these impurities, but when
the body is purged it returns to its natural size.

the truth concerning the soul can only be established by the word of
god. still, we may venture to assert what is probable both concerning
soul and body.

the creative powers were aware of our tendency to excess. and so when
they made the belly to be a receptacle for food, in order that men might
not perish by insatiable gluttony, they formed the convolutions of the
intestines, in this way retarding the passage of food through the body,
lest mankind should be absorbed in eating and drinking, and the whole
race become impervious to divine philosophy.

the creation of bones and flesh was on this wise. the foundation of
these is the marrow which binds together body and soul, and the marrow
is made out of such of the primary triangles as are adapted by their
perfection to produce all the four elements. these god took and mingled
them in due proportion, making as many kinds of marrow as there were
hereafter to be kinds of souls. the receptacle of the divine soul he
made round, and called that portion of the marrow brain, intending that
the vessel containing this substance should be the head. the remaining
part he divided into long and round figures, and to these as to anchors,
fastening the mortal soul, he proceeded to make the rest of the body,
first forming for both parts a covering of bone. the bone was formed by
sifting pure smooth earth and wetting it with marrow. it was then thrust
alternately into fire and water, and thus rendered insoluble by either.
of bone he made a globe which he placed around the brain, leaving a
narrow opening, and around the marrow of the neck and spine he formed
the vertebrae, like hinges, which extended from the head through the
whole of the trunk. and as the bone was brittle and liable to mortify
and destroy the marrow by too great rigidity and susceptibility to heat
and cold, he contrived sinews and flesh--the first to give flexibility,
the second to guard against heat and cold, and to be a protection
against falls, containing a warm moisture, which in summer exudes and
cools the body, and in winter is a defence against cold. having this in
view, the creator mingled earth with fire and water and mixed with them
a ferment of acid and salt, so as to form pulpy flesh. but the sinews
he made of a mixture of bone and unfermented flesh, giving them a
mean nature between the two, and a yellow colour. hence they were more
glutinous than flesh, but softer than bone. the bones which have most of
the living soul within them he covered with the thinnest film of
flesh, those which have least of it, he lodged deeper. at the joints he
diminished the flesh in order not to impede the flexure of the limbs,
and also to avoid clogging the perceptions of the mind. about the
thighs and arms, which have no sense because there is little soul in the
marrow, and about the inner bones, he laid the flesh thicker. for where
the flesh is thicker there is less feeling, except in certain parts
which the creator has made solely of flesh, as for example, the tongue.
had the combination of solid bone and thick flesh been consistent with
acute perceptions, the creator would have given man a sinewy and fleshy
head, and then he would have lived twice as long. but our creators were
of opinion that a shorter life which was better was preferable to a
longer which was worse, and therefore they covered the head with thin
bone, and placed the sinews at the extremity of the head round the neck,
and fastened the jawbones to them below the face. and they framed the
mouth, having teeth and tongue and lips, with a view to the necessary
and the good; for food is a necessity, and the river of speech is the
best of rivers. still, the head could not be left a bare globe of bone
on account of the extremes of heat and cold, nor be allowed to become
dull and senseless by an overgrowth of flesh. wherefore it was covered
by a peel or skin which met and grew by the help of the cerebral humour.
the diversity of the sutures was caused by the struggle of the food
against the courses of the soul. the skin of the head was pierced by
fire, and out of the punctures came forth a moisture, part liquid,
and part of a skinny nature, which was hardened by the pressure of the
external cold and became hair. and god gave hair to the head of man
to be a light covering, so that it might not interfere with his
perceptions. nails were formed by combining sinew, skin, and bone, and
were made by the creators with a view to the future when, as they knew,
women and other animals who would require them would be framed out of
man.

the gods also mingled natures akin to that of man with other forms and
perceptions. thus trees and plants were created, which were originally
wild and have been adapted by cultivation to our use. they partake of
that third kind of life which is seated between the midriff and the
navel, and is altogether passive and incapable of reflection.

when the creators had furnished all these natures for our sustenance,
they cut channels through our bodies as in a garden, watering them with
a perennial stream. two were cut down the back, along the back bone,
where the skin and flesh meet, one on the right and the other on the
left, having the marrow of generation between them. in the next place,
they divided the veins about the head and interlaced them with each
other in order that they might form an additional link between the head
and the body, and that the sensations from both sides might be diffused
throughout the body. in the third place, they contrived the passage
of liquids, which may be explained in this way:--finer bodies retain
coarser, but not the coarser the finer, and the belly is capable of
retaining food, but not fire and air. god therefore formed a network of
fire and air to irrigate the veins, having within it two lesser nets,
and stretched cords reaching from both the lesser nets to the extremity
of the outer net. the inner parts of the net were made by him of fire,
the lesser nets and their cavities of air. the two latter he made to
pass into the mouth; the one ascending by the air-pipes from the lungs,
the other by the side of the air-pipes from the belly. the entrance to
the first he divided into two parts, both of which he made to meet at
the channels of the nose, that when the mouth was closed the passage
connected with it might still be fed with air. the cavity of the network
he spread around the hollows of the body, making the entire receptacle
to flow into and out of the lesser nets and the lesser nets into and out
of it, while the outer net found a way into and out of the pores of the
body, and the internal heat followed the air to and fro. these, as we
affirm, are the phenomena of respiration. and all this process takes
place in order that the body may be watered and cooled and nourished,
and the meat and drink digested and liquefied and carried into the
veins.

the causes of respiration have now to be considered. the exhalation of
the breath through the mouth and nostrils displaces the external air,
and at the same time leaves a vacuum into which through the pores the
air which is displaced enters. also the vacuum which is made when the
air is exhaled through the pores is filled up by the inhalation of
breath through the mouth and nostrils. the explanation of this double
phenomenon is as follows:--elements move towards their natural places.
now as every animal has within him a fountain of fire, the air which
is inhaled through the mouth and nostrils, on coming into contact
with this, is heated; and when heated, in accordance with the law of
attraction, it escapes by the way it entered toward the place of fire.
on leaving the body it is cooled and drives round the air which it
displaces through the pores into the empty lungs. this again is in turn
heated by the internal fire and escapes, as it entered, through the
pores.

the phenomena of medical cupping-glasses, of swallowing, and of the
hurling of bodies, are to be explained on a similar principle; as also
sounds, which are sometimes discordant on account of the inequality
of them, and again harmonious by reason of equality. the slower sounds
reaching the swifter, when they begin to pause, by degrees assimilate
with them: whence arises a pleasure which even the unwise feel, and
which to the wise becomes a higher sense of delight, being an imitation
of divine harmony in mortal motions. streams flow, lightnings play,
amber and the magnet attract, not by reason of attraction, but because
'nature abhors a vacuum,' and because things, when compounded or
dissolved, move different ways, each to its own place.

i will now return to the phenomena of respiration. the fire, entering
the belly, minces the food, and as it escapes, fills the veins by
drawing after it the divided portions, and thus the streams of nutriment
are diffused through the body. the fruits or herbs which are our daily
sustenance take all sorts of colours when intermixed, but the colour of
red or fire predominates, and hence the liquid which we call blood is
red, being the nurturing principle of the body, whence all parts are
watered and empty places filled.

the process of repletion and depletion is produced by the attraction
of like to like, after the manner of the universal motion. the external
elements by their attraction are always diminishing the substance of
the body: the particles of blood, too, formed out of the newly digested
food, are attracted towards kindred elements within the body and so fill
up the void. when more is taken away than flows in, then we decay; and
when less, we grow and increase.

the young of every animal has the triangles new and closely locked
together, and yet the entire frame is soft and delicate, being newly
made of marrow and nurtured on milk. these triangles are sharper than
those which enter the body from without in the shape of food, and
therefore they cut them up. but as life advances, the triangles wear out
and are no longer able to assimilate food; and at length, when the bonds
which unite the triangles of the marrow become undone, they in turn
unloose the bonds of the soul; and if the release be according to
nature, she then flies away with joy. for the death which is natural is
pleasant, but that which is caused by violence is painful.

every one may understand the origin of diseases. they may be occasioned
by the disarrangement or disproportion of the elements out of which the
body is framed. this is the origin of many of them, but the worst of all
owe their severity to the following causes: there is a natural order
in the human frame according to which the flesh and sinews are made of
blood, the sinews out of the fibres, and the flesh out of the congealed
substance which is formed by separation from the fibres. the glutinous
matter which comes away from the sinews and the flesh, not only binds
the flesh to the bones, but nourishes the bones and waters the marrow.
when these processes take place in regular order the body is in health.

but when the flesh wastes and returns into the veins there is
discoloured blood as well as air in the veins, having acid and salt
qualities, from which is generated every sort of phlegm and bile. all
things go the wrong way and cease to give nourishment to the body, no
longer preserving their natural courses, but at war with themselves
and destructive to the constitution of the body. the oldest part of the
flesh which is hard to decompose blackens from long burning, and from
being corroded grows bitter, and as the bitter element refines away,
becomes acid. when tinged with blood the bitter substance has a red
colour, and this when mixed with black takes the hue of grass; or again,
the bitter substance has an auburn colour, when new flesh is decomposed
by the internal flame. to all which phenomena some physician or
philosopher who was able to see the one in many has given the name of
bile. the various kinds of bile have names answering to their colours.
lymph or serum is of two kinds: first, the whey of blood, which is
gentle; secondly, the secretion of dark and bitter bile, which, when
mingled under the influence of heat with salt, is malignant and
is called acid phlegm. there is also white phlegm, formed by the
decomposition of young and tender flesh, and covered with little
bubbles, separately invisible, but becoming visible when collected.
the water of tears and perspiration and similar substances is also the
watery part of fresh phlegm. all these humours become sources of disease
when the blood is replenished in irregular ways and not by food or
drink. the danger, however, is not so great when the foundation remains,
for then there is a possibility of recovery. but when the substance
which unites the flesh and bones is diseased, and is no longer renewed
from the muscles and sinews, and instead of being oily and smooth and
glutinous becomes rough and salt and dry, then the fleshy parts fall
away and leave the sinews bare and full of brine, and the flesh gets
back again into the circulation of the blood, and makes the previously
mentioned disorders still greater. there are other and worse diseases
which are prior to these; as when the bone through the density of
the flesh does not receive sufficient air, and becomes stagnant and
gangrened, and crumbling away passes into the food, and the food into
the flesh, and the flesh returns again into the blood. worst of all and
most fatal is the disease of the marrow, by which the whole course
of the body is reversed. there is a third class of diseases which are
produced, some by wind and some by phlegm and some by bile. when the
lung, which is the steward of the air, is obstructed, by rheums, and
in one part no air, and in another too much, enters in, then the parts
which are unrefreshed by air corrode, and other parts are distorted by
the excess of air; and in this manner painful diseases are produced. the
most painful are caused by wind generated within the body, which gets
about the great sinews of the shoulders--these are termed tetanus. the
cure of them is difficult, and in most cases they are relieved only by
fever. white phlegm, which is dangerous if kept in, by reason of the air
bubbles, is not equally dangerous if able to escape through the pores,
although it variegates the body, generating diverse kinds of leprosies.
if, when mingled with black bile, it disturbs the courses of the head
in sleep, there is not so much danger; but if it assails those who are
awake, then the attack is far more dangerous, and is called epilepsy or
the sacred disease. acid and salt phlegm is the source of catarrh.

inflammations originate in bile, which is sometimes relieved by boils
and swellings, but when detained, and above all when mingled with pure
blood, generates many inflammatory disorders, disturbing the position of
the fibres which are scattered about in the blood in order to maintain
the balance of rare and dense which is necessary to its regular
circulation. if the bile, which is only stale blood, or liquefied flesh,
comes in little by little, it is congealed by the fibres and produces
internal cold and shuddering. but when it enters with more of a flood
it overcomes the fibres by its heat and reaches the spinal marrow, and
burning up the cables of the soul sets her free from the body. when on
the other hand the body, though wasted, still holds out, then the bile
is expelled, like an exile from a factious state, causing associating
diarrhoeas and dysenteries and similar disorders. the body which is
diseased from the effects of fire is in a continual fever; when air is
the agent, the fever is quotidian; when water, the fever intermits a
day; when earth, which is the most sluggish element, the fever intermits
three days and is with difficulty shaken off.

of mental disorders there are two sorts, one madness, the other
ignorance, and they may be justly attributed to disease. excessive
pleasures or pains are among the greatest diseases, and deprive men of
their senses. when the seed about the spinal marrow is too abundant, the
body has too great pleasures and pains; and during a great part of his
life he who is the subject of them is more or less mad. he is
often thought bad, but this is a mistake; for the truth is that the
intemperance of lust is due to the fluidity of the marrow produced by
the loose consistency of the bones. and this is true of vice in
general, which is commonly regarded as disgraceful, whereas it is really
involuntary and arises from a bad habit of the body and evil education.
in like manner the soul is often made vicious by the influence of bodily
pain; the briny phlegm and other bitter and bilious humours wander over
the body and find no exit, but are compressed within, and mingle their
own vapours with the motions of the soul, and are carried to the
three places of the soul, creating infinite varieties of trouble and
melancholy, of rashness and cowardice, of forgetfulness and stupidity.
when men are in this evil plight of body, and evil forms of government
and evil discourses are superadded, and there is no education to save
them, they are corrupted through two causes; but of neither of them are
they really the authors. for the planters are to blame rather than the
plants, the educators and not the educated. still, we should endeavour
to attain virtue and avoid vice; but this is part of another subject.

enough of disease--i have now to speak of the means by which the mind
and body are to be preserved, a higher theme than the other. the good
is the beautiful, and the beautiful is the symmetrical, and there is no
greater or fairer symmetry than that of body and soul, as the contrary
is the greatest of deformities. a leg or an arm too long or too short
is at once ugly and unserviceable, and the same is true if body and soul
are disproportionate. for a strong and impassioned soul may 'fret the
pigmy body to decay,' and so produce convulsions and other evils. the
violence of controversy, or the earnestness of enquiry, will often
generate inflammations and rheums which are not understood, or assigned
to their true cause by the professors of medicine. and in like manner
the body may be too much for the soul, darkening the reason, and
quickening the animal desires. the only security is to preserve the
balance of the two, and to this end the mathematician or philosopher
must practise gymnastics, and the gymnast must cultivate music. the
parts of the body too must be treated in the same way--they should
receive their appropriate exercise. for the body is set in motion when
it is heated and cooled by the elements which enter in, or is dried up
and moistened by external things; and, if given up to these processes
when at rest, it is liable to destruction. but the natural motion, as
in the world, so also in the human frame, produces harmony and divides
hostile powers. the best exercise is the spontaneous motion of the body,
as in gymnastics, because most akin to the motion of mind; not so
good is the motion of which the source is in another, as in sailing or
riding; least good when the body is at rest and the motion is in parts
only, which is a species of motion imparted by physic. this should only
be resorted to by men of sense in extreme cases; lesser diseases are
not to be irritated by medicine. for every disease is akin to the living
being and has an appointed term, just as life has, which depends on the
form of the triangles, and cannot be protracted when they are worn out.
and he who, instead of accepting his destiny, endeavours to prolong
his life by medicine, is likely to multiply and magnify his diseases.
regimen and not medicine is the true cure, when a man has time at his
disposal.

enough of the nature of man and of the body, and of training and
education. the subject is a great one and cannot be adequately treated
as an appendage to another. to sum up all in a word: there are three
kinds of soul located within us, and any one of them, if remaining
inactive, becomes very weak; if exercised, very strong. wherefore we
should duly train and exercise all three kinds.

the divine soul god lodged in the head, to raise us, like plants which
are not of earthly origin, to our kindred; for the head is nearest
to heaven. he who is intent upon the gratification of his desires and
cherishes the mortal soul, has all his ideas mortal, and is himself
mortal in the truest sense. but he who seeks after knowledge and
exercises the divine part of himself in godly and immortal thoughts,
attains to truth and immortality, as far as is possible to man, and also
to happiness, while he is training up within him the divine principle
and indwelling power of order. there is only one way in which one person
can benefit another; and that is by assigning to him his proper nurture
and motion. to the motions of the soul answer the motions of the
universe, and by the study of these the individual is restored to his
original nature.

thus we have finished the discussion of the universe, which, according
to our original intention, has now been brought down to the creation of
man. completeness seems to require that something should be briefly said
about other animals: first of women, who are probably degenerate and
cowardly men. and when they degenerated, the gods implanted in men the
desire of union with them, creating in man one animate substance and
in woman another in the following manner:--the outlet for liquids they
connected with the living principle of the spinal marrow, which the man
has the desire to emit into the fruitful womb of the woman; this is like
a fertile field in which the seed is quickened and matured, and at
last brought to light. when this desire is unsatisfied the man is
over-mastered by the power of the generative organs, and the woman
is subjected to disorders from the obstruction of the passages of the
breath, until the two meet and pluck the fruit of the tree.

the race of birds was created out of innocent, light-minded men,
who thought to pursue the study of the heavens by sight; these were
transformed into birds, and grew feathers instead of hair. the race
of wild animals were men who had no philosophy, and never looked up to
heaven or used the courses of the head, but followed only the influences
of passion. naturally they turned to their kindred earth, and put their
forelegs to the ground, and their heads were crushed into strange
oblong forms. some of them have four feet, and some of them more than
four,--the latter, who are the more senseless, drawing closer to their
native element; the most senseless of all have no limbs and trail their
whole body on the ground. the fourth kind are the inhabitants of the
waters; these are made out of the most senseless and ignorant and impure
of men, whom god placed in the uttermost parts of the world in return
for their utter ignorance, and caused them to respire water instead of
the pure element of air. such are the laws by which animals pass into
one another.

and so the world received animals, mortal and immortal, and was
fulfilled with them, and became a visible god, comprehending the
visible, made in the image of the intellectual, being the one perfect
only-begotten heaven.

section 2.

nature in the aspect which she presented to a greek philosopher of the
fourth century before christ is not easily reproduced to modern eyes.
the associations of mythology and poetry have to be added, and the
unconscious influence of science has to be subtracted, before we can
behold the heavens or the earth as they appeared to the greek. the
philosopher himself was a child and also a man--a child in the range of
his attainments, but also a great intelligence having an insight into
nature, and often anticipations of the truth. he was full of original
thoughts, and yet liable to be imposed upon by the most obvious
fallacies. he occasionally confused numbers with ideas, and atoms
with numbers; his a priori notions were out of all proportion to his
experience. he was ready to explain the phenomena of the heavens by the
most trivial analogies of earth. the experiments which nature worked for
him he sometimes accepted, but he never tried experiments for himself
which would either prove or disprove his theories. his knowledge was
unequal; while in some branches, such as medicine and astronomy, he had
made considerable proficiency, there were others, such as chemistry,
electricity, mechanics, of which the very names were unknown to him.
he was the natural enemy of mythology, and yet mythological ideas still
retained their hold over him. he was endeavouring to form a conception
of principles, but these principles or ideas were regarded by him as
real powers or entities, to which the world had been subjected. he was
always tending to argue from what was near to what was remote, from what
was known to what was unknown, from man to the universe, and back again
from the universe to man. while he was arranging the world, he was
arranging the forms of thought in his own mind; and the light from
within and the light from without often crossed and helped to confuse
one another. he might be compared to a builder engaged in some great
design, who could only dig with his hands because he was unprovided with
common tools; or to some poet or musician, like tynnichus (ion), obliged
to accommodate his lyric raptures to the limits of the tetrachord or of

the hesiodic and orphic cosmogonies were a phase of thought intermediate
between mythology and philosophy and had a great influence on the
beginnings of knowledge. there was nothing behind them; they were to
physical science what the poems of homer were to early greek history.
they made men think of the world as a whole; they carried the mind back
into the infinity of past time; they suggested the first observation
of the effects of fire and water on the earth's surface. to the ancient
physics they stood much in the same relation which geology does to
modern science. but the greek was not, like the enquirer of the last
generation, confined to a period of six thousand years; he was able to
speculate freely on the effects of infinite ages in the production of
physical phenomena. he could imagine cities which had existed time
out of mind (states.; laws), laws or forms of art and music which had
lasted, 'not in word only, but in very truth, for ten thousand years'
(laws); he was aware that natural phenomena like the delta of the nile
might have slowly accumulated in long periods of time (hdt.). but he
seems to have supposed that the course of events was recurring rather
than progressive. to this he was probably led by the fixedness of
egyptian customs and the general observation that there were other
civilisations in the world more ancient than that of hellas.

the ancient philosophers found in mythology many ideas which, if not
originally derived from nature, were easily transferred to her--such,
for example, as love or hate, corresponding to attraction or repulsion;
or the conception of necessity allied both to the regularity and
irregularity of nature; or of chance, the nameless or unknown cause; or
of justice, symbolizing the law of compensation; are of the fates and
furies, typifying the fixed order or the extraordinary convulsions of
nature. their own interpretations of homer and the poets were supposed
by them to be the original meaning. musing in themselves on the
phenomena of nature, they were relieved at being able to utter the
thoughts of their hearts in figures of speech which to them were not
figures, and were already consecrated by tradition. hesiod and the
orphic poets moved in a region of half-personification in which the
meaning or principle appeared through the person. in their vaster
conceptions of chaos, erebus, aether, night, and the like, the first
rude attempts at generalization are dimly seen. the gods themselves,
especially the greater gods, such as zeus, poseidon, apollo, athene, are
universals as well as individuals. they were gradually becoming lost
in a common conception of mind or god. they continued to exist for the
purposes of ritual or of art; but from the sixth century onwards or even
earlier there arose and gained strength in the minds of men the notion
of 'one god, greatest among gods and men, who was all sight, all
hearing, all knowing' (xenophanes).

under the influence of such ideas, perhaps also deriving from the
traditions of their own or of other nations scraps of medicine and
astronomy, men came to the observation of nature. the greek philosopher
looked at the blue circle of the heavens and it flashed upon him that
all things were one; the tumult of sense abated, and the mind found
repose in the thought which former generations had been striving to
realize. the first expression of this was some element, rarefied by
degrees into a pure abstraction, and purged from any tincture of sense.
soon an inner world of ideas began to be unfolded, more absorbing, more
overpowering, more abiding than the brightest of visible objects, which
to the eye of the philosopher looking inward, seemed to pale before
them, retaining only a faint and precarious existence. at the same time,
the minds of men parted into the two great divisions of those who saw
only a principle of motion, and of those who saw only a principle of
rest, in nature and in themselves; there were born heracliteans or
eleatics, as there have been in later ages born aristotelians or
platonists. like some philosophers in modern times, who are accused of
making a theory first and finding their facts afterwards, the advocates
of either opinion never thought of applying either to themselves or to
their adversaries the criterion of fact. they were mastered by their
ideas and not masters of them. like the heraclitean fanatics whom plato
has ridiculed in the theaetetus, they were incapable of giving a
reason of the faith that was in them, and had all the animosities of a
religious sect. yet, doubtless, there was some first impression derived
from external nature, which, as in mythology, so also in philosophy,
worked upon the minds of the first thinkers. though incapable of
induction or generalization in the modern sense, they caught an
inspiration from the external world. the most general facts or
appearances of nature, the circle of the universe, the nutritive power
of water, the air which is the breath of life, the destructive force
of fire, the seeming regularity of the greater part of nature and the
irregularity of a remnant, the recurrence of day and night and of the
seasons, the solid earth and the impalpable aether, were always present
to them.

the great source of error and also the beginning of truth to them
was reasoning from analogy; they could see resemblances, but not
differences; and they were incapable of distinguishing illustration
from argument. analogy in modern times only points the way, and is
immediately verified by experiment. the dreams and visions, which
pass through the philosopher's mind, of resemblances between different
classes of substances, or between the animal and vegetable world, are
put into the refiner's fire, and the dross and other elements which
adhere to them are purged away. but the contemporary of plato and
socrates was incapable of resisting the power of any analogy which
occurred to him, and was drawn into any consequences which seemed to
follow. he had no methods of difference or of concomitant variations, by
the use of which he could distinguish the accidental from the essential.
he could not isolate phenomena, and he was helpless against the
influence of any word which had an equivocal or double sense.

yet without this crude use of analogy the ancient physical philosopher
would have stood still; he could not have made even 'one guess among
many' without comparison. the course of natural phenomena would have
passed unheeded before his eyes, like fair sights or musical sounds
before the eyes and ears of an animal. even the fetichism of the savage
is the beginning of reasoning; the assumption of the most fanciful of
causes indicates a higher mental state than the absence of all enquiry
about them. the tendency to argue from the higher to the lower, from
man to the world, has led to many errors, but has also had an elevating
influence on philosophy. the conception of the world as a whole, a
person, an animal, has been the source of hasty generalizations; yet
this general grasp of nature led also to a spirit of comprehensiveness
in early philosophy, which has not increased, but rather diminished, as
the fields of knowledge have become more divided. the modern physicist
confines himself to one or perhaps two branches of science. but he
comparatively seldom rises above his own department, and often falls
under the narrowing influence which any single branch, when pursued
to the exclusion of every other, has over the mind. language, two,
exercised a spell over the beginnings of physical philosophy, leading
to error and sometimes to truth; for many thoughts were suggested by
the double meanings of words (greek), and the accidental distinctions
of words sometimes led the ancient philosopher to make corresponding
differences in things (greek). 'if they are the same, why have they
different names; or if they are different, why have they the same
name?'--is an argument not easily answered in the infancy of knowledge.
the modern philosopher has always been taught the lesson which he still
imperfectly learns, that he must disengage himself from the influence
of words. nor are there wanting in plato, who was himself too often the
victim of them, impressive admonitions that we should regard not words
but things (states.). but upon the whole, the ancients, though not
entirely dominated by them, were much more subject to the influence
of words than the moderns. they had no clear divisions of colours
or substances; even the four elements were undefined; the fields of
knowledge were not parted off. they were bringing order out of disorder,
having a small grain of experience mingled in a confused heap of
a priori notions. and yet, probably, their first impressions, the
illusions and mirages of their fancy, created a greater intellectual
activity and made a nearer approach to the truth than any patient
investigation of isolated facts, for which the time had not yet come,
could have accomplished.

there was one more illusion to which the ancient philosophers were
subject, and against which plato in his later dialogues seems to be
struggling--the tendency to mere abstractions; not perceiving that
pure abstraction is only negation, they thought that the greater the
abstraction the greater the truth. behind any pair of ideas a new
idea which comprehended them--the (greek), as it was technically
termed--began at once to appear. two are truer than three, one than two.
the words 'being,' or 'unity,' or essence,' or 'good,' became sacred to
them. they did not see that they had a word only, and in one sense the
most unmeaning of words. they did not understand that the content of
notions is in inverse proportion to their universality--the element
which is the most widely diffused is also the thinnest; or, in the
language of the common logic, the greater the extension the less the
comprehension. but this vacant idea of a whole without parts, of a
subject without predicates, a rest without motion, has been also the
most fruitful of all ideas. it is the beginning of a priori thought, and
indeed of thinking at all. men were led to conceive it, not by a love
of hasty generalization, but by a divine instinct, a dialectical
enthusiasm, in which the human faculties seemed to yearn for
enlargement. we know that 'being' is only the verb of existence, the
copula, the most general symbol of relation, the first and most meagre
of abstractions; but to some of the ancient philosophers this little
word appeared to attain divine proportions, and to comprehend all truth.
being or essence, and similar words, represented to them a supreme or
divine being, in which they thought that they found the containing and
continuing principle of the universe. in a few years the human mind was
peopled with abstractions; a new world was called into existence to give
law and order to the old. but between them there was still a gulf, and
no one could pass from the one to the other.

number and figure were the greatest instruments of thought which were
possessed by the greek philosopher; having the same power over the mind
which was exerted by abstract ideas, they were also capable of practical
application. many curious and, to the early thinker, mysterious
properties of them came to light when they were compared with one
another. they admitted of infinite multiplication and construction;
in pythagorean triangles or in proportions of 1:2:4:8 and 1:3:9:27, or
compounds of them, the laws of the world seemed to be more than half
revealed. they were also capable of infinite subdivision--a wonder and
also a puzzle to the ancient thinker (rep.). they were not, like being
or essence, mere vacant abstractions, but admitted of progress and
growth, while at the same time they confirmed a higher sentiment of the
mind, that there was order in the universe. and so there began to be
a real sympathy between the world within and the world without. the
numbers and figures which were present to the mind's eye became visible
to the eye of sense; the truth of nature was mathematics; the other
properties of objects seemed to reappear only in the light of number.
law and morality also found a natural expression in number and figure.
instruments of such power and elasticity could not fail to be 'a most
gracious assistance' to the first efforts of human intelligence.

there was another reason why numbers had so great an influence over the
minds of early thinkers--they were verified by experience. every use
of them, even the most trivial, assured men of their truth; they were
everywhere to be found, in the least things and the greatest alike.
one, two, three, counted on the fingers was a 'trivial matter (rep.), a
little instrument out of which to create a world; but from these and by
the help of these all our knowledge of nature has been developed. they
were the measure of all things, and seemed to give law to all things;
nature was rescued from chaos and confusion by their power; the notes of
music, the motions of the stars, the forms of atoms, the evolution and
recurrence of days, months, years, the military divisions of an army,
the civil divisions of a state, seemed to afford a 'present witness'
of them--what would have become of man or of the world if deprived of
number (rep.)? the mystery of number and the mystery of music were akin.
there was a music of rhythm and of harmonious motion everywhere; and to
the real connexion which existed between music and number, a fanciful or
imaginary relation was superadded. there was a music of the spheres as
well as of the notes of the lyre. if in all things seen there was number
and figure, why should they not also pervade the unseen world, with
which by their wonderful and unchangeable nature they seemed to hold
communion?

two other points strike us in the use which the ancient philosophers
made of numbers. first, they applied to external nature the relations of
them which they found in their own minds; and where nature seemed to be
at variance with number, as for example in the case of fractions, they
protested against her (rep.; arist. metaph.). having long meditated on
the properties of 1:2:4:8, or 1:3:9:27, or of 3, 4, 5, they discovered
in them many curious correspondences and were disposed to find in them
the secret of the universe. secondly, they applied number and figure
equally to those parts of physics, such as astronomy or mechanics, in
which the modern philosopher expects to find them, and to those in
which he would never think of looking for them, such as physiology and
psychology. for the sciences were not yet divided, and there was nothing
really irrational in arguing that the same laws which regulated the
heavenly bodies were partially applied to the erring limbs or brain of
man. astrology was the form which the lively fancy of ancient thinkers
almost necessarily gave to astronomy. the observation that the lower
principle, e.g. mechanics, is always seen in the higher, e.g. in the
phenomena of life, further tended to perplex them. plato's doctrine
of the same and the other ruling the courses of the heavens and of the
human body is not a mere vagary, but is a natural result of the state of
knowledge and thought at which he had arrived.

when in modern times we contemplate the heavens, a certain amount of
scientific truth imperceptibly blends, even with the cursory glance of
an unscientific person. he knows that the earth is revolving round the
sun, and not the sun around the earth. he does not imagine the earth to
be the centre of the universe, and he has some conception of chemistry
and the cognate sciences. a very different aspect of nature would have
been present to the mind of the early greek philosopher. he would have
beheld the earth a surface only, not mirrored, however faintly, in the
glass of science, but indissolubly connected with some theory of one,
two, or more elements. he would have seen the world pervaded by number
and figure, animated by a principle of motion, immanent in a principle
of rest. he would have tried to construct the universe on a quantitative
principle, seeming to find in endless combinations of geometrical
figures or in the infinite variety of their sizes a sufficient account
of the multiplicity of phenomena. to these a priori speculations he
would add a rude conception of matter and his own immediate experience
of health and disease. his cosmos would necessarily be imperfect and
unequal, being the first attempt to impress form and order on the
primaeval chaos of human knowledge. he would see all things as in a
dream.

the ancient physical philosophers have been charged by dr. whewell
and others with wasting their fine intelligences in wrong methods of
enquiry; and their progress in moral and political philosophy has
been sometimes contrasted with their supposed failure in physical
investigations. 'they had plenty of ideas,' says dr. whewell, 'and
plenty of facts; but their ideas did not accurately represent the facts
with which they were acquainted.' this is a very crude and misleading
way of describing ancient science. it is the mistake of an uneducated
person--uneducated, that is, in the higher sense of the word--who
imagines every one else to be like himself and explains every other age
by his own. no doubt the ancients often fell into strange and fanciful
errors: the time had not yet arrived for the slower and surer path of
the modern inductive philosophy. but it remains to be shown that they
could have done more in their age and country; or that the contributions
which they made to the sciences with which they were acquainted are not
as great upon the whole as those made by their successors. there is no
single step in astronomy as great as that of the nameless pythagorean
who first conceived the world to be a body moving round the sun in
space: there is no truer or more comprehensive principle than the
application of mathematics alike to the heavenly bodies, and to the
particles of matter. the ancients had not the instruments which would
have enabled them to correct or verify their anticipations, and their
opportunities of observation were limited. plato probably did more
for physical science by asserting the supremacy of mathematics than
aristotle or his disciples by their collections of facts. when the
thinkers of modern times, following bacon, undervalue or disparage the
speculations of ancient philosophers, they seem wholly to forget the
conditions of the world and of the human mind, under which they
carried on their investigations. when we accuse them of being under the
influence of words, do we suppose that we are altogether free from this
illusion? when we remark that greek physics soon became stationary or
extinct, may we not observe also that there have been and may be again
periods in the history of modern philosophy which have been barren and
unproductive? we might as well maintain that greek art was not real
or great, because it had nihil simile aut secundum, as say that greek
physics were a failure because they admire no subsequent progress.

the charge of premature generalization which is often urged against
ancient philosophers is really an anachronism. for they can hardly be
said to have generalized at all. they may be said more truly to have
cleared up and defined by the help of experience ideas which they
already possessed. the beginnings of thought about nature must always
have this character. a true method is the result of many ages of
experiment and observation, and is ever going on and enlarging with the
progress of science and knowledge. at first men personify nature, then
they form impressions of nature, at last they conceive 'measure' or laws
of nature. they pass out of mythology into philosophy. early science is
not a process of discovery in the modern sense; but rather a process
of correcting by observation, and to a certain extent only, the first
impressions of nature, which mankind, when they began to think,
had received from poetry or language or unintelligent sense. of all
scientific truths the greatest and simplest is the uniformity of nature;
this was expressed by the ancients in many ways, as fate, or necessity,
or measure, or limit. unexpected events, of which the cause was unknown
to them, they attributed to chance (thucyd.). but their conception of
nature was never that of law interrupted by exceptions,--a somewhat
unfortunate metaphysical invention of modern times, which is at variance
with facts and has failed to satisfy the requirements of thought.

section 3.

plato's account of the soul is partly mythical or figurative, and partly
literal. not that either he or we can draw a line between them, or say,
'this is poetry, this is philosophy'; for the transition from the one
to the other is imperceptible. neither must we expect to find in him
absolute consistency. he is apt to pass from one level or stage of
thought to another without always making it apparent that he is changing
his ground. in such passages we have to interpret his meaning by the
general spirit of his writings. to reconcile his inconsistencies would
be contrary to the first principles of criticism and fatal to any true
understanding of him.

there is a further difficulty in explaining this part of the
timaeus--the natural order of thought is inverted. we begin with the
most abstract, and proceed from the abstract to the concrete. we
are searching into things which are upon the utmost limit of human
intelligence, and then of a sudden we fall rather heavily to the earth.
there are no intermediate steps which lead from one to the other. but
the abstract is a vacant form to us until brought into relation with
man and nature. god and the world are mere names, like the being of
the eleatics, unless some human qualities are added on to them. yet the
negation has a kind of unknown meaning to us. the priority of god and
of the world, which he is imagined to have created, to all other
existences, gives a solemn awe to them. and as in other systems of
theology and philosophy, that of which we know least has the greatest
interest to us.

there is no use in attempting to define or explain the first god in the
platonic system, who has sometimes been thought to answer to god the
father; or the world, in whom the fathers of the church seemed to
recognize 'the firstborn of every creature.' nor need we discuss at
length how far plato agrees in the later jewish idea of creation,
according to which god made the world out of nothing. for his original
conception of matter as something which has no qualities is really a
negation. moreover in the hebrew scriptures the creation of the world
is described, even more explicitly than in the timaeus, not as a single
act, but as a work or process which occupied six days. there is a chaos
in both, and it would be untrue to say that the greek, any more than the
hebrew, had any definite belief in the eternal existence of matter. the
beginning of things vanished into the distance. the real creation began,
not with matter, but with ideas. according to plato in the timaeus, god
took of the same and the other, of the divided and undivided, of the
finite and infinite, and made essence, and out of the three combined
created the soul of the world. to the soul he added a body formed out
of the four elements. the general meaning of these words is that god
imparted determinations of thought, or, as we might say, gave law
and variety to the material universe. the elements are moving in a
disorderly manner before the work of creation begins; and there is an
eternal pattern of the world, which, like the 'idea of good,' is not
the creator himself, but not separable from him. the pattern too, though
eternal, is a creation, a world of thought prior to the world of
sense, which may be compared to the wisdom of god in the book of
ecclesiasticus, or to the 'god in the form of a globe' of the old
eleatic philosophers. the visible, which already exists, is fashioned
in the likeness of this eternal pattern. on the other hand, there is no
truth of which plato is more firmly convinced than of the priority of
the soul to the body, both in the universe and in man. so inconsistent
are the forms in which he describes the works which no tongue
can utter--his language, as he himself says, partaking of his own
uncertainty about the things of which he is speaking.

we may remark in passing, that the platonic compared with the
jewish description of the process of creation has less of freedom or
spontaneity. the creator in plato is still subject to a remnant of
necessity which he cannot wholly overcome. when his work is accomplished
he remains in his own nature. plato is more sensible than the hebrew
prophet of the existence of evil, which he seeks to put as far as
possible out of the way of god. and he can only suppose this to be
accomplished by god retiring into himself and committing the lesser
works of creation to inferior powers. (compare, however, laws for
another solution of the difficulty.)

nor can we attach any intelligible meaning to his words when he speaks
of the visible being in the image of the invisible. for how can that
which is divided be like that which is undivided? or that which
is changing be the copy of that which is unchanging? all the old
difficulties about the ideas come back upon us in an altered form. we
can imagine two worlds, one of which is the mere double of the other, or
one of which is an imperfect copy of the other, or one of which is the
vanishing ideal of the other; but we cannot imagine an intellectual
world which has no qualities--'a thing in itself'--a point which has no
parts or magnitude, which is nowhere, and nothing. this cannot be the
archetype according to which god made the world, and is in reality,
whether in plato or in kant, a mere negative residuum of human thought.

there is another aspect of the same difficulty which appears to have no
satisfactory solution. in what relation does the archetype stand to the
creator himself? for the idea or pattern of the world is not the thought
of god, but a separate, self-existent nature, of which creation is
the copy. we can only reply, (1) that to the mind of plato subject and
object were not yet distinguished; (2) that he supposes the process of
creation to take place in accordance with his own theory of ideas; and
as we cannot give a consistent account of the one, neither can we of
the other. he means (3) to say that the creation of the world is not
a material process of working with legs and arms, but ideal and
intellectual; according to his own fine expression, 'the thought of
god made the god that was to be.' he means (4) to draw an absolute
distinction between the invisible or unchangeable which is or is the
place of mind or being, and the world of sense or becoming which is
visible and changing. he means (5) that the idea of the world is prior
to the world, just as the other ideas are prior to sensible objects; and
like them may be regarded as eternal and self-existent, and also, like
the idea of good, may be viewed apart from the divine mind.

there are several other questions which we might ask and which can
receive no answer, or at least only an answer of the same kind as the
preceding. how can matter be conceived to exist without form? or, how
can the essences or forms of things be distinguished from the eternal
ideas, or essence itself from the soul? or, how could there have been
motion in the chaos when as yet time was not? or, how did chaos come
into existence, if not by the will of the creator? or, how could there
have been a time when the world was not, if time was not? or, how could
the creator have taken portions of an indivisible same? or, how could
space or anything else have been eternal when time is only created? or,
how could the surfaces of geometrical figures have formed solids? we
must reply again that we cannot follow plato in all his inconsistencies,
but that the gaps of thought are probably more apparent to us than to
him. he would, perhaps, have said that 'the first things are known only
to god and to him of men whom god loves.' how often have the gaps in
theology been concealed from the eye of faith! and we may say that only
by an effort of metaphysical imagination can we hope to understand plato
from his own point of view; we must not ask for consistency. everywhere
we find traces of the platonic theory of knowledge expressed in an
objective form, which by us has to be translated into the subjective,
before we can attach any meaning to it. and this theory is exhibited
in so many different points of view, that we cannot with any certainty
interpret one dialogue by another; e.g. the timaeus by the parmenides or
phaedrus or philebus.

the soul of the world may also be conceived as the personification of
the numbers and figures in which the heavenly bodies move. imagine
these as in a pythagorean dream, stripped of qualitative difference and
reduced to mathematical abstractions. they too conform to the principle
of the same, and may be compared with the modern conception of laws of
nature. they are in space, but not in time, and they are the makers
of time. they are represented as constantly thinking of the same; for
thought in the view of plato is equivalent to truth or law, and need not
imply a human consciousness, a conception which is familiar enough to
us, but has no place, hardly even a name, in ancient greek philosophy.
to this principle of the same is opposed the principle of the other--the
principle of irregularity and disorder, of necessity and chance, which
is only partially impressed by mathematical laws and figures. (we
may observe by the way, that the principle of the other, which is the
principle of plurality and variation in the timaeus, has nothing in
common with the 'other' of the sophist, which is the principle of
determination.) the element of the same dominates to a certain extent
over the other--the fixed stars keep the 'wanderers' of the inner circle
in their courses, and a similar principle of fixedness or order appears
to regulate the bodily constitution of man. but there still remains a
rebellious seed of evil derived from the original chaos, which is the
source of disorder in the world, and of vice and disease in man.

but what did plato mean by essence, (greek), which is the intermediate
nature compounded of the same and the other, and out of which, together
with these two, the soul of the world is created? it is difficult to
explain a process of thought so strange and unaccustomed to us, in which
modern distinctions run into one another and are lost sight of. first,
let us consider once more the meaning of the same and the other. the
same is the unchanging and indivisible, the heaven of the fixed stars,
partaking of the divine nature, which, having law in itself, gives law
to all besides and is the element of order and permanence in man and
on the earth. it is the rational principle, mind regarded as a work, as
creation--not as the creator. the old tradition of parmenides and of the
eleatic being, the foundation of so much in the philosophy of greece and
of the world, was lingering in plato's mind. the other is the variable
or changing element, the residuum of disorder or chaos, which cannot be
reduced to order, nor altogether banished, the source of evil, seen in
the errors of man and also in the wanderings of the planets, a necessity
which protrudes through nature. of this too there was a shadow in the
eleatic philosophy in the realm of opinion, which, like a mist, seemed
to darken the purity of truth in itself.--so far the words of plato may
perhaps find an intelligible meaning. but when he goes on to speak of
the essence which is compounded out of both, the track becomes fainter
and we can only follow him with hesitating steps. but still we find a
trace reappearing of the teaching of anaxagoras: 'all was confusion, and
then mind came and arranged things.' we have already remarked that plato
was not acquainted with the modern distinction of subject and object,
and therefore he sometimes confuses mind and the things of mind--(greek)
and (greek). by (greek) he clearly means some conception of the
intelligible and the intelligent; it belongs to the class of (greek).
matter, being, the same, the eternal,--for any of these terms, being
almost vacant of meaning, is equally suitable to express indefinite
existence,--are compared or united with the other or diverse, and out of
the union or comparison is elicited the idea of intelligence, the 'one
in many,' brighter than any promethean fire (phil.), which co-existing
with them and so forming a new existence, is or becomes the intelligible
world...so we may perhaps venture to paraphrase or interpret or put into
other words the parable in which plato has wrapped up his conception
of the creation of the world. the explanation may help to fill up with
figures of speech the void of knowledge.

the entire compound was divided by the creator in certain proportions
and reunited; it was then cut into two strips, which were bent into an
inner circle and an outer, both moving with an uniform motion around a
centre, the outer circle containing the fixed, the inner the wandering
stars. the soul of the world was diffused everywhere from the centre to
the circumference. to this god gave a body, consisting at first of
fire and earth, and afterwards receiving an addition of air and water;
because solid bodies, like the world, are always connected by two middle
terms and not by one. the world was made in the form of a globe, and all
the material elements were exhausted in the work of creation.

the proportions in which the soul of the world as well as the human soul
is divided answer to a series of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27, composed
of the two pythagorean progressions 1, 2, 4, 8 and 1, 3, 9, 27, of which
the number 1 represents a point, 2 and 3 lines, 4 and 8, 9 and 27 the
squares and cubes respectively of 2 and 3. this series, of which the
intervals are afterwards filled up, probably represents (1) the diatonic
scale according to the pythagoreans and plato; (2) the order and
distances of the heavenly bodies; and (3) may possibly contain an
allusion to the music of the spheres, which is referred to in the myth
at the end of the republic. the meaning of the words that 'solid bodies
are always connected by two middle terms' or mean proportionals has
been much disputed. the most received explanation is that of martin, who
supposes that plato is only speaking of surfaces and solids compounded
of prime numbers (i.e. of numbers not made up of two factors, or, in
other words, only measurable by unity). the square of any such number
represents a surface, the cube a solid. the squares of any two such
numbers (e.g. 2 squared, 3 squared = 4, 9), have always a single mean
proportional (e.g. 4 and 9 have the single mean 6), whereas the cubes
of primes (e.g. 3 cubed and 5 cubed) have always two mean proportionals
(e.g. 27:45:75:125). but to this explanation of martin's it may be
objected, (1) that plato nowhere says that his proportion is to be
limited to prime numbers; (2) that the limitation of surfaces to squares
is also not to be found in his words; nor (3) is there any evidence to
show that the distinction of prime from other numbers was known to
him. what plato chiefly intends to express is that a solid requires a
stronger bond than a surface; and that the double bond which is given
by two means is stronger than the single bond given by one. having
reflected on the singular numerical phenomena of the existence of one
mean proportional between two square numbers are rather perhaps only
between the two lowest squares; and of two mean proportionals between
two cubes, perhaps again confining his attention to the two lowest
cubes, he finds in the latter symbol an expression of the relation
of the elements, as in the former an image of the combination of two
surfaces. between fire and earth, the two extremes, he remarks that
there are introduced, not one, but two elements, air and water, which
are compared to the two mean proportionals between two cube numbers.
the vagueness of his language does not allow us to determine whether
anything more than this was intended by him.

leaving the further explanation of details, which the reader will find
discussed at length in boeckh and martin, we may now return to the main
argument: why did god make the world? like man, he must have a purpose;
and his purpose is the diffusion of that goodness or good which he
himself is. the term 'goodness' is not to be understood in this passage
as meaning benevolence or love, in the christian sense of the term, but
rather law, order, harmony, like the idea of good in the republic. the
ancient mythologers, and even the hebrew prophets, had spoken of the
jealousy of god; and the greek had imagined that there was a nemesis
always attending the prosperity of mortals. but plato delights to think
of god as the author of order in his works, who, like a father, lives
over again in his children, and can never have too much of good or
friendship among his creatures. only, as there is a certain remnant of
evil inherent in matter which he cannot get rid of, he detaches himself
from them and leaves them to themselves, that he may be guiltless of
their faults and sufferings.

between the ideal and the sensible plato interposes the two natures of
time and space. time is conceived by him to be only the shadow or
image of eternity which ever is and never has been or will be, but is
described in a figure only as past or future. this is one of the great
thoughts of early philosophy, which are still as difficult to our minds
as they were to the early thinkers; or perhaps more difficult, because
we more distinctly see the consequences which are involved in such
an hypothesis. all the objections which may be urged against kant's
doctrine of the ideality of space and time at once press upon us. if
time is unreal, then all which is contained in time is unreal--the
succession of human thoughts as well as the flux of sensations; there is
no connecting link between (greek) and (greek). yet, on the other hand,
we are conscious that knowledge is independent of time, that truth
is not a thing of yesterday or tomorrow, but an 'eternal now.' to the
'spectator of all time and all existence' the universe remains at rest.
the truths of geometry and arithmetic in all their combinations are
always the same. the generations of men, like the leaves of the forest,
come and go, but the mathematical laws by which the world is governed
remain, and seem as if they could never change. the ever-present image
of space is transferred to time--succession is conceived as extension.
(we remark that plato does away with the above and below in space, as
he has done away with the absolute existence of past and future.) the
course of time, unless regularly marked by divisions of number, partakes
of the indefiniteness of the heraclitean flux. by such reflections we
may conceive the greek to have attained the metaphysical conception of
eternity, which to the hebrew was gained by meditation on the divine
being. no one saw that this objective was really a subjective, and
involved the subjectivity of all knowledge. 'non in tempore sed cum
tempore finxit deus mundum,' says st. augustine, repeating a thought
derived from the timaeus, but apparently unconscious of the results to
which his doctrine would have led.

the contradictions involved in the conception of time or motion, like
the infinitesimal in space, were a source of perplexity to the mind of
the greek, who was driven to find a point of view above or beyond them.
they had sprung up in the decline of the eleatic philosophy and
were very familiar to plato, as we gather from the parmenides. the
consciousness of them had led the great eleatic philosopher to
describe the nature of god or being under negatives. he sings of 'being
unbegotten and imperishable, unmoved and never-ending, which never was
nor will be, but always is, one and continuous, which cannot spring from
any other; for it cannot be said or imagined not to be.' the idea
of eternity was for a great part a negation. there are regions of
speculation in which the negative is hardly separable from the positive,
and even seems to pass into it. not only buddhism, but greek as well as
christian philosophy, show that it is quite possible that the human mind
should retain an enthusiasm for mere negations. in different ages and
countries there have been forms of light in which nothing could be
discerned and which have nevertheless exercised a life-giving and
illumining power. for the higher intelligence of man seems to require,
not only something above sense, but above knowledge, which can only
be described as mind or being or truth or god or the unchangeable and
eternal element, in the expression of which all predicates fail and fall
short. eternity or the eternal is not merely the unlimited in time
but the truest of all being, the most real of all realities, the most
certain of all knowledge, which we nevertheless only see through a glass
darkly. the passionate earnestness of parmenides contrasts with the
vacuity of the thought which he is revolving in his mind.

space is said by plato to be the 'containing vessel or nurse of
generation.' reflecting on the simplest kinds of external objects, which
to the ancients were the four elements, he was led to a more general
notion of a substance, more or less like themselves, out of which they
were fashioned. he would not have them too precisely distinguished.
thus seems to have arisen the first dim perception of (greek) or matter,
which has played so great a part in the metaphysical philosophy of
aristotle and his followers. but besides the material out of which the
elements are made, there is also a space in which they are contained.
there arises thus a second nature which the senses are incapable of
discerning and which can hardly be referred to the intelligible class.
for it is and it is not, it is nowhere when filled, it is nothing
when empty. hence it is said to be discerned by a kind of spurious
or analogous reason, partaking so feebly of existence as to be hardly
perceivable, yet always reappearing as the containing mother or nurse of
all things. it had not that sort of consistency to plato which has been
given to it in modern times by geometry and metaphysics. neither of
the greek words by which it is described are so purely abstract as the
english word 'space' or the latin 'spatium.' neither plato nor any other
greek would have spoken of (greek) or (greek) in the same manner as we
speak of 'time' and 'space.'

yet space is also of a very permanent or even eternal nature; and
plato seems more willing to admit of the unreality of time than of the
unreality of space; because, as he says, all things must necessarily
exist in space. we, on the other hand, are disposed to fancy that even
if space were annihilated time might still survive. he admits indeed
that our knowledge of space is of a dreamy kind, and is given by a
spurious reason without the help of sense. (compare the hypotheses and
images of rep.) it is true that it does not attain to the clearness
of ideas. but like them it seems to remain, even if all the objects
contained in it are supposed to have vanished away. hence it was natural
for plato to conceive of it as eternal. we must remember further that in
his attempt to realize either space or matter the two abstract ideas of
weight and extension, which are familiar to us, had never passed before
his mind.

thus far god, working according to an eternal pattern, out of his
goodness has created the same, the other, and the essence (compare the
three principles of the philebus--the finite, the infinite, and the
union of the two), and out of them has formed the outer circle of the
fixed stars and the inner circle of the planets, divided according to
certain musical intervals; he has also created time, the moving image
of eternity, and space, existing by a sort of necessity and hardly
distinguishable from matter. the matter out of which the world is formed
is not absolutely void, but retains in the chaos certain germs or traces
of the elements. these plato, like empedocles, supposed to be four in
number--fire, air, earth, and water. they were at first mixed together;
but already in the chaos, before god fashioned them by form and number,
the greater masses of the elements had an appointed place. into the
confusion (greek) which preceded plato does not attempt further to
penetrate. they are called elements, but they are so far from being
elements (greek) or letters in the higher sense that they are not even
syllables or first compounds. the real elements are two triangles, the
rectangular isosceles which has but one form, and the most beautiful of
the many forms of scalene, which is half of an equilateral triangle. by
the combination of these triangles which exist in an infinite variety of
sizes, the surfaces of the four elements are constructed.

that there were only five regular solids was already known to the
ancients, and out of the surfaces which he has formed plato proceeds to
generate the four first of the five. he perhaps forgets that he is only
putting together surfaces and has not provided for their transformation
into solids. the first solid is a regular pyramid, of which the base and
sides are formed by four equilateral or twenty-four scalene triangles.
each of the four solid angles in this figure is a little larger than
the largest of obtuse angles. the second solid is composed of the same
triangles, which unite as eight equilateral triangles, and make one
solid angle out of four plane angles--six of these angles form a regular
octahedron. the third solid is a regular icosahedron, having twenty
triangular equilateral bases, and therefore 120 rectangular scalene
triangles. the fourth regular solid, or cube, is formed by the
combination of four isosceles triangles into one square and of six
squares into a cube. the fifth regular solid, or dodecahedron, cannot
be formed by a combination of either of these triangles, but each of its
faces may be regarded as composed of thirty triangles of another kind.
probably plato notices this as the only remaining regular polyhedron,
which from its approximation to a globe, and possibly because, as
plutarch remarks, it is composed of 12 x 30 = 360 scalene triangles
(platon. quaest.), representing thus the signs and degrees of the
zodiac, as well as the months and days of the year, god may be said to
have 'used in the delineation of the universe.' according to plato
earth was composed of cubes, fire of regular pyramids, air of regular
octahedrons, water of regular icosahedrons. the stability of the last
three increases with the number of their sides.

the elements are supposed to pass into one another, but we must remember
that these transformations are not the transformations of real solids,
but of imaginary geometrical figures; in other words, we are composing
and decomposing the faces of substances and not the substances
themselves--it is a house of cards which we are pulling to pieces and
putting together again (compare however laws). yet perhaps plato may
regard these sides or faces as only the forms which are impressed on
pre-existent matter. it is remarkable that he should speak of each of
these solids as a possible world in itself, though upon the whole
he inclines to the opinion that they form one world and not five.
to suppose that there is an infinite number of worlds, as democritus
(hippolyt. ref. haer. i.) had said, would be, as he satirically
observes, 'the characteristic of a very indefinite and ignorant mind.'

the twenty triangular faces of an icosahedron form the faces or sides of
two regular octahedrons and of a regular pyramid (20 = 8 x 2 + 4); and
therefore, according to plato, a particle of water when decomposed is
supposed to give two particles of air and one of fire. so because an
octahedron gives the sides of two pyramids (8 = 4 x 2), a particle of
air is resolved into two particles of fire.

the transformation is effected by the superior power or number of the
conquering elements. the manner of the change is (1) a separation of
portions of the elements from the masses in which they are collected;
(2) a resolution of them into their original triangles; and (3) a
reunion of them in new forms. plato himself proposes the question,
why does motion continue at all when the elements are settled in their
places? he answers that although the force of attraction is continually
drawing similar elements to the same spot, still the revolution of the
universe exercises a condensing power, and thrusts them again out of
their natural places. thus want of uniformity, the condition of motion,
is produced. in all such disturbances of matter there is an alternative
for the weaker element: it may escape to its kindred, or take the form
of the stronger--becoming denser, if it be denser, or rarer if rarer.
this is true of fire, air, and water, which, being composed of similar
triangles, are interchangeable; earth, however, which has triangles
peculiar to itself, is capable of dissolution, but not of change. of the
interchangeable elements, fire, the rarest, can only become a denser,
and water, the densest, only a rarer: but air may become a denser or
a rarer. no single particle of the elements is visible, but only the
aggregates of them are seen. the subordinate species depend, not upon
differences of form in the original triangles, but upon differences of
size. the obvious physical phenomena from which plato has gathered his
views of the relations of the elements seem to be the effect of fire
upon air, water, and earth, and the effect of water upon earth.
the particles are supposed by him to be in a perpetual process of
circulation caused by inequality. this process of circulation does not
admit of a vacuum, as he tells us in his strange account of respiration.

of the phenomena of light and heavy he speaks afterwards, when treating
of sensation, but they may be more conveniently considered by us in this
place. they are not, he says, to be explained by 'above' and 'below,'
which in the universal globe have no existence, but by the attraction of
similars towards the great masses of similar substances; fire to
fire, air to air, water to water, earth to earth. plato's doctrine of
attraction implies not only (1) the attraction of similar elements
to one another, but also (2) of smaller bodies to larger ones. had he
confined himself to the latter he would have arrived, though, perhaps,
without any further result or any sense of the greatness of the
discovery, at the modern doctrine of gravitation. he does not observe
that water has an equal tendency towards both water and earth. so easily
did the most obvious facts which were inconsistent with his theories
escape him.

the general physical doctrines of the timaeus may be summed up as
follows: (1) plato supposes the greater masses of the elements to have
been already settled in their places at the creation: (2) they are four
in number, and are formed of rectangular triangles variously combined
into regular solid figures: (3) three of them, fire, air, and water,
admit of transformation into one another; the fourth, earth, cannot be
similarly transformed: (4) different sizes of the same triangles form
the lesser species of each element: (5) there is an attraction of like
to like--smaller masses of the same kind being drawn towards greater:
(6) there is no void, but the particles of matter are ever pushing one
another round and round (greek). like the atomists, plato attributes the
differences between the elements to differences in geometrical figures.
but he does not explain the process by which surfaces become solids;
and he characteristically ridicules democritus for not seeing that the
worlds are finite and not infinite.

section 4.

the astronomy of plato is based on the two principles of the same and
the other, which god combined in the creation of the world. the soul,
which is compounded of the same, the other, and the essence, is diffused
from the centre to the circumference of the heavens. we speak of a soul
of the universe; but more truly regarded, the universe of the timaeus is
a soul, governed by mind, and holding in solution a residuum of matter
or evil, which the author of the world is unable to expel, and of which
plato cannot tell us the origin. the creation, in plato's sense, is
really the creation of order; and the first step in giving order is the
division of the heavens into an inner and outer circle of the other and
the same, of the divisible and the indivisible, answering to the two
spheres, of the planets and of the world beyond them, all together
moving around the earth, which is their centre. to us there is a
difficulty in apprehending how that which is at rest can also be in
motion, or that which is indivisible exist in space. but the whole
description is so ideal and imaginative, that we can hardly venture to
attribute to many of plato's words in the timaeus any more meaning
than to his mythical account of the heavens in the republic and in the
phaedrus. (compare his denial of the 'blasphemous opinion' that there
are planets or wandering stars; all alike move in circles--laws.) the
stars are the habitations of the souls of men, from which they come and
to which they return. in attributing to the fixed stars only the most
perfect motion--that which is on the same spot or circulating around the
same--he might perhaps have said that to 'the spectator of all time and
all existence,' to borrow once more his own grand expression, or viewed,
in the language of spinoza, 'sub specie aeternitatis,' they were still
at rest, but appeared to move in order to teach men the periods of time.
although absolutely in motion, they are relatively at rest; or we
may conceive of them as resting, while the space in which they are
contained, or the whole anima mundi, revolves.

the universe revolves around a centre once in twenty-four hours, but the
orbits of the fixed stars take a different direction from those of the
planets. the outer and the inner sphere cross one another and meet again
at a point opposite to that of their first contact; the first moving in
a circle from left to right along the side of a parallelogram which is
supposed to be inscribed in it, the second also moving in a circle along
the diagonal of the same parallelogram from right to left; or, in other
words, the first describing the path of the equator, the second, the
path of the ecliptic. the motion of the second is controlled by the
first, and hence the oblique line in which the planets are supposed to
move becomes a spiral. the motion of the same is said to be undivided,
whereas the inner motion is split into seven unequal orbits--the
intervals between them being in the ratio of two and three, three of
either:--the sun, moving in the opposite direction to mercury and
venus, but with equal swiftness; the remaining four, moon, saturn, mars,
jupiter, with unequal swiftness to the former three and to one another.
thus arises the following progression:--moon 1, sun 2, venus 3, mercury
4, mars 8, jupiter 9, saturn 27. this series of numbers is the compound
of the two pythagorean ratios, having the same intervals, though not in
the same order, as the mixture which was originally divided in forming
the soul of the world.

plato was struck by the phenomenon of mercury, venus, and the sun
appearing to overtake and be overtaken by one another. the true reason
of this, namely, that they lie within the circle of the earth's orbit,
was unknown to him, and the reason which he gives--that the two former
move in an opposite direction to the latter--is far from explaining the
appearance of them in the heavens. all the planets, including the sun,
are carried round in the daily motion of the circle of the fixed stars,
and they have a second or oblique motion which gives the explanation
of the different lengths of the sun's course in different parts of the
earth. the fixed stars have also two movements--a forward movement in
their orbit which is common to the whole circle; and a movement on the
same spot around an axis, which plato calls the movement of thought
about the same. in this latter respect they are more perfect than the
wandering stars, as plato himself terms them in the timaeus, although in
the laws he condemns the appellation as blasphemous.

the revolution of the world around earth, which is accomplished in
a single day and night, is described as being the most perfect or
intelligent. yet plato also speaks of an 'annus magnus' or cyclical
year, in which periods wonderful for their complexity are found to
coincide in a perfect number, i.e. a number which equals the sum of its
factors, as 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. this, although not literally contradictory,
is in spirit irreconcilable with the perfect revolution of twenty-four
hours. the same remark may be applied to the complexity of the
appearances and occultations of the stars, which, if the outer heaven is
supposed to be moving around the centre once in twenty-four hours, must
be confined to the effects produced by the seven planets. plato seems to
confuse the actual observation of the heavens with his desire to find in
them mathematical perfection. the same spirit is carried yet further
by him in the passage already quoted from the laws, in which he affirms
their wanderings to be an appearance only, which a little knowledge of
mathematics would enable men to correct.

we have now to consider the much discussed question of the rotation or
immobility of the earth. plato's doctrine on this subject is contained
in the following words:--'the earth, which is our nurse, compacted (or
revolving) around the pole which is extended through the universe, he
made to be the guardian and artificer of night and day, first and eldest
of gods that are in the interior of heaven'. there is an unfortunate
doubt in this passage (1) about the meaning of the word (greek), which
is translated either 'compacted' or 'revolving,' and is equally capable
of both explanations. a doubt (2) may also be raised as to whether the
words 'artificer of day and night' are consistent with the mere passive
causation of them, produced by the immobility of the earth in the midst
of the circling universe. we must admit, further, (3) that aristotle
attributed to plato the doctrine of the rotation of the earth on its
axis. on the other hand it has been urged that if the earth goes round
with the outer heaven and sun in twenty-four hours, there is no way of
accounting for the alternation of day and night; since the equal motion
of the earth and sun would have the effect of absolute immobility. to
which it may be replied that plato never says that the earth goes round
with the outer heaven and sun; although the whole question depends on
the relation of earth and sun, their movements are nowhere precisely
described. but if we suppose, with mr. grote, that the diurnal rotation
of the earth on its axis and the revolution of the sun and outer heaven
precisely coincide, it would be difficult to imagine that plato was
unaware of the consequence. for though he was ignorant of many things
which are familiar to us, and often confused in his ideas where we have
become clear, we have no right to attribute to him a childish want of
reasoning about very simple facts, or an inability to understand the
necessary and obvious deductions from geometrical figures or movements.
of the causes of day and night the pre-socratic philosophers, and
especially the pythagoreans, gave various accounts, and therefore the
question can hardly be imagined to have escaped him. on the other hand
it may be urged that the further step, however simple and obvious, is
just what plato often seems to be ignorant of, and that as there is
no limit to his insight, there is also no limit to the blindness which
sometimes obscures his intelligence (compare the construction of solids
out of surfaces in his account of the creation of the world, or the
attraction of similars to similars). further, mr. grote supposes, not
that (greek) means 'revolving,' or that this is the sense in which
aristotle understood the word, but that the rotation of the earth is
necessarily implied in its adherence to the cosmical axis. but (a) if,
as mr grote assumes, plato did not see that the rotation of the earth
on its axis and of the sun and outer heavens around the earth in equal
times was inconsistent with the alternation of day and night, neither
need we suppose that he would have seen the immobility of the earth to
be inconsistent with the rotation of the axis. and (b) what proof is
there that the axis of the world revolves at all? (c) the comparison of
the two passages quoted by mr grote (see his pamphlet on 'the rotation
of the earth') from aristotle de coelo, book ii (greek) clearly shows,
although this is a matter of minor importance, that aristotle, as
proclus and simplicius supposed, understood (greek) in the timaeus to
mean 'revolving.' for the second passage, in which motion on an axis is
expressly mentioned, refers to the first, but this would be unmeaning
unless (greek) in the first passage meant rotation on an axis. (4)
the immobility of the earth is more in accordance with plato's other
writings than the opposite hypothesis. for in the phaedo the earth is
described as the centre of the world, and is not said to be in motion.
in the republic the pilgrims appear to be looking out from the earth
upon the motions of the heavenly bodies; in the phaedrus, hestia,
who remains immovable in the house of zeus while the other gods go in
procession, is called the first and eldest of the gods, and is probably
the symbol of the earth. the silence of plato in these and in some other
passages (laws) in which he might be expected to speak of the rotation
of the earth, is more favourable to the doctrine of its immobility than
to the opposite. if he had meant to say that the earth revolves on its
axis, he would have said so in distinct words, and have explained the
relation of its movements to those of the other heavenly bodies. (5)
the meaning of the words 'artificer of day and night' is literally true
according to plato's view. for the alternation of day and night is not
produced by the motion of the heavens alone, or by the immobility of the
earth alone, but by both together; and that which has the inherent force
or energy to remain at rest when all other bodies are moving, may be
truly said to act, equally with them. (6) we should not lay too much
stress on aristotle or the writer de caelo having adopted the other
interpretation of the words, although alexander of aphrodisias thinks
that he could not have been ignorant either of the doctrine of plato
or of the sense which he intended to give to the word (greek). for the
citations of plato in aristotle are frequently misinterpreted by him;
and he seems hardly ever to have had in his mind the connection in which
they occur. in this instance the allusion is very slight, and there
is no reason to suppose that the diurnal revolution of the heavens was
present to his mind. hence we need not attribute to him the error from
which we are defending plato.

after weighing one against the other all these complicated
probabilities, the final conclusion at which we arrive is that there
is nearly as much to be said on the one side of the question as on the
other, and that we are not perfectly certain, whether, as bockh and the
majority of commentators, ancient as well as modern, are inclined to
believe, plato thought that the earth was at rest in the centre of the
universe, or, as aristotle and mr. grote suppose, that it revolved on
its axis. whether we assume the earth to be stationary in the centre of
the universe, or to revolve with the heavens, no explanation is given of
the variation in the length of days and nights at different times of the
year. the relations of the earth and heavens are so indistinct in the
timaeus and so figurative in the phaedo, phaedrus and republic, that we
must give up the hope of ascertaining how they were imagined by plato,
if he had any fixed or scientific conception of them at all.

section 5.

the soul of the world is framed on the analogy of the soul of man, and
many traces of anthropomorphism blend with plato's highest flights of
idealism. the heavenly bodies are endowed with thought; the principles
of the same and other exist in the universe as well as in the human
mind. the soul of man is made out of the remains of the elements which
had been used in creating the soul of the world; these remains, however,
are diluted to the third degree; by this plato expresses the measure of
the difference between the soul human and divine. the human soul, like
the cosmical, is framed before the body, as the mind is before the soul
of either--this is the order of the divine work--and the finer parts of
the body, which are more akin to the soul, such as the spinal marrow,
are prior to the bones and flesh. the brain, the containing vessel of
the divine part of the soul, is (nearly) in the form of a globe, which
is the image of the gods, who are the stars, and of the universe.

there is, however, an inconsistency in plato's manner of conceiving
the soul of man; he cannot get rid of the element of necessity which is
allowed to enter. he does not, like kant, attempt to vindicate for men a
freedom out of space and time; but he acknowledges him to be subject
to the influence of external causes, and leaves hardly any place
for freedom of the will. the lusts of men are caused by their bodily
constitution, though they may be increased by bad education and bad
laws, which implies that they may be decreased by good education and
good laws. he appears to have an inkling of the truth that to the higher
nature of man evil is involuntary. this is mixed up with the view which,
while apparently agreeing with it, is in reality the opposite of it,
that vice is due to physical causes. in the timaeus, as well as in the
laws, he also regards vices and crimes as simply involuntary; they are
diseases analogous to the diseases of the body, and arising out of the
same causes. if we draw together the opposite poles of plato's system,
we find that, like spinoza, he combines idealism with fatalism.

the soul of man is divided by him into three parts, answering roughly
to the charioteer and steeds of the phaedrus, and to the (greek) of the
republic and nicomachean ethics. first, there is the immortal nature
of which the brain is the seat, and which is akin to the soul of the
universe. this alone thinks and knows and is the ruler of the whole.
secondly, there is the higher mortal soul which, though liable to
perturbations of her own, takes the side of reason against the lower
appetites. the seat of this is the heart, in which courage, anger, and
all the nobler affections are supposed to reside. there the veins all
meet; it is their centre or house of guard whence they carry the orders
of the thinking being to the extremities of his kingdom. there is also
a third or appetitive soul, which receives the commands of the immortal
part, not immediately but mediately, through the liver, which reflects
on its surface the admonitions and threats of the reason.

the liver is imagined by plato to be a smooth and bright substance,
having a store of sweetness and also of bitterness, which reason freely
uses in the execution of her mandates. in this region, as ancient
superstition told, were to be found intimations of the future. but
plato is careful to observe that although such knowledge is given to the
inferior parts of man, it requires to be interpreted by the superior.
reason, and not enthusiasm, is the true guide of man; he is only
inspired when he is demented by some distemper or possession. the
ancient saying, that 'only a man in his senses can judge of his own
actions,' is approved by modern philosophy too. the same irony which
appears in plato's remark, that 'the men of old time must surely have
known the gods who were their ancestors, and we should believe them as
custom requires,' is also manifest in his account of divination.

the appetitive soul is seated in the belly, and there imprisoned like
a wild beast, far away from the council chamber, as plato graphically
calls the head, in order that the animal passions may not interfere with
the deliberations of reason. though the soul is said by him to be prior
to the body, yet we cannot help seeing that it is constructed on the
model of the body--the threefold division into the rational, passionate,
and appetitive corresponding to the head, heart and belly. the human
soul differs from the soul of the world in this respect, that it is
enveloped and finds its expression in matter, whereas the soul of the
world is not only enveloped or diffused in matter, but is the element
in which matter moves. the breath of man is within him, but the air or
aether of heaven is the element which surrounds him and all things.

pleasure and pain are attributed in the timaeus to the suddenness of our
sensations--the first being a sudden restoration, the second a sudden
violation, of nature (phileb.). the sensations become conscious to us
when they are exceptional. sight is not attended either by pleasure or
pain, but hunger and the appeasing of hunger are pleasant and painful
because they are extraordinary.

section 6.

i shall not attempt to connect the physiological speculations of plato
either with ancient or modern medicine. what light i can throw upon them
will be derived from the comparison of them with his general system.

there is no principle so apparent in the physics of the timaeus, or in
ancient physics generally, as that of continuity. the world is conceived
of as a whole, and the elements are formed into and out of one another;
the varieties of substances and processes are hardly known or noticed.
and in a similar manner the human body is conceived of as a whole, and
the different substances of which, to a superficial observer, it appears
to be composed--the blood, flesh, sinews--like the elements out of which
they are formed, are supposed to pass into one another in regular order,
while the infinite complexity of the human frame remains unobserved. and
diseases arise from the opposite process--when the natural proportions
of the four elements are disturbed, and the secondary substances which
are formed out of them, namely, blood, flesh, sinews, are generated in
an inverse order.

plato found heat and air within the human frame, and the blood
circulating in every part. he assumes in language almost unintelligible
to us that a network of fire and air envelopes the greater part of the
body. this outer net contains two lesser nets, one corresponding to
the stomach, the other to the lungs; and the entrance to the latter is
forked or divided into two passages which lead to the nostrils and to
the mouth. in the process of respiration the external net is said to
find a way in and out of the pores of the skin: while the interior of
it and the lesser nets move alternately into each other. the whole
description is figurative, as plato himself implies when he speaks of a
'fountain of fire which we compare to the network of a creel.' he really
means by this what we should describe as a state of heat or temperature
in the interior of the body. the 'fountain of fire' or heat is also in a
figure the circulation of the blood. the passage is partly imagination,
partly fact.

he has a singular theory of respiration for which he accounts solely by
the movement of the air in and out of the body; he does not attribute
any part of the process to the action of the body itself. the air has
a double ingress and a double exit, through the mouth or nostrils, and
through the skin. when exhaled through the mouth or nostrils, it leaves
a vacuum which is filled up by other air finding a way in through the
pores, this air being thrust out of its place by the exhalation from the
mouth and nostrils. there is also a corresponding process of inhalation
through the mouth or nostrils, and of exhalation through the pores. the
inhalation through the pores appears to take place nearly at the same
time as the exhalation through the mouth; and conversely. the internal
fire is in either case the propelling cause outwards--the inhaled air,
when heated by it, having a natural tendency to move out of the body to
the place of fire; while the impossibility of a vacuum is the propelling
cause inwards.

thus we see that this singular theory is dependent on two principles
largely employed by plato in explaining the operations of nature, the
impossibility of a vacuum and the attraction of like to like. to these
there has to be added a third principle, which is the condition of
the action of the other two,--the interpenetration of particles in
proportion to their density or rarity. it is this which enables fire and
air to permeate the flesh.

plato's account of digestion and the circulation of the blood is closely
connected with his theory of respiration. digestion is supposed to be
effected by the action of the internal fire, which in the process of
respiration moves into the stomach and minces the food. as the fire
returns to its place, it takes with it the minced food or blood; and in
this way the veins are replenished. plato does not enquire how the blood
is separated from the faeces.

of the anatomy and functions of the body he knew very little,--e.g.
of the uses of the nerves in conveying motion and sensation, which he
supposed to be communicated by the bones and veins; he was also ignorant
of the distinction between veins and arteries;--the latter term
he applies to the vessels which conduct air from the mouth to the
lungs;--he supposes the lung to be hollow and bloodless; the spinal
marrow he conceives to be the seed of generation; he confuses the parts
of the body with the states of the body--the network of fire and air is
spoken of as a bodily organ; he has absolutely no idea of the phenomena
of respiration, which he attributes to a law of equalization in nature,
the air which is breathed out displacing other air which finds a way
in; he is wholly unacquainted with the process of digestion. except the
general divisions into the spleen, the liver, the belly, and the lungs,
and the obvious distinctions of flesh, bones, and the limbs of the body,
we find nothing that reminds us of anatomical facts. but we find much
which is derived from his theory of the universe, and transferred
to man, as there is much also in his theory of the universe which is
suggested by man. the microcosm of the human body is the lesser image of
the macrocosm. the courses of the same and the other affect both; they
are made of the same elements and therefore in the same proportions.
both are intelligent natures endued with the power of self-motion,
and the same equipoise is maintained in both. the animal is a sort of
'world' to the particles of the blood which circulate in it. all the
four elements entered into the original composition of the human frame;
the bone was formed out of smooth earth; liquids of various kinds pass
to and fro; the network of fire and air irrigates the veins. infancy
and childhood is the chaos or first turbid flux of sense prior to the
establishment of order; the intervals of time which may be observed in
some intermittent fevers correspond to the density of the elements. the
spinal marrow, including the brain, is formed out of the finest sorts of
triangles, and is the connecting link between body and mind. health is
only to be preserved by imitating the motions of the world in space,
which is the mother and nurse of generation. the work of digestion
is carried on by the superior sharpness of the triangles forming the
substances of the human body to those which are introduced into it in
the shape of food. the freshest and acutest forms of triangles are those
that are found in children, but they become more obtuse with advancing
years; and when they finally wear out and fall to pieces, old age and
death supervene.

as in the republic, plato is still the enemy of the purgative treatment
of physicians, which, except in extreme cases, no man of sense will ever
adopt. for, as he adds, with an insight into the truth, 'every disease
is akin to the nature of the living being and is only irritated by
stimulants.' he is of opinion that nature should be left to herself, and
is inclined to think that physicians are in vain (laws--where he says
that warm baths would be more beneficial to the limbs of the aged rustic
than the prescriptions of a not over-wise doctor). if he seems to be
extreme in his condemnation of medicine and to rely too much on diet and
exercise, he might appeal to nearly all the best physicians of our own
age in support of his opinions, who often speak to their patients of the
worthlessness of drugs. for we ourselves are sceptical about medicine,
and very unwilling to submit to the purgative treatment of physicians.
may we not claim for plato an anticipation of modern ideas as about some
questions of astronomy and physics, so also about medicine? as in the
charmides he tells us that the body cannot be cured without the soul,
so in the timaeus he strongly asserts the sympathy of soul and body;
any defect of either is the occasion of the greatest discord and
disproportion in the other. here too may be a presentiment that in the
medicine of the future the interdependence of mind and body will be more
fully recognized, and that the influence of the one over the other may
be exerted in a manner which is not now thought possible.

section 7.

in plato's explanation of sensation we are struck by the fact that
he has not the same distinct conception of organs of sense which is
familiar to ourselves. the senses are not instruments, but rather
passages, through which external objects strike upon the mind. the eye
is the aperture through which the stream of vision passes, the ear is
the aperture through which the vibrations of sound pass. but that the
complex structure of the eye or the ear is in any sense the cause of
sight and hearing he seems hardly to be aware.

the process of sight is the most complicated (rep.), and consists of
three elements--the light which is supposed to reside within the eye,
the light of the sun, and the light emitted from external objects. when
the light of the eye meets the light of the sun, and both together meet
the light issuing from an external object, this is the simple act of
sight. when the particles of light which proceed from the object are
exactly equal to the particles of the visual ray which meet them from
within, then the body is transparent. if they are larger and contract
the visual ray, a black colour is produced; if they are smaller and
dilate it, a white. other phenomena are produced by the variety and
motion of light. a sudden flash of fire at once elicits light and
moisture from the eye, and causes a bright colour. a more subdued light,
on mingling with the moisture of the eye, produces a red colour. out
of these elements all other colours are derived. all of them are
combinations of bright and red with white and black. plato himself tells
us that he does not know in what proportions they combine, and he is of
opinion that such knowledge is granted to the gods only. to have seen
the affinity of them to each other and their connection with light, is
not a bad basis for a theory of colours. we must remember that they were
not distinctly defined to his, as they are to our eyes; he saw them, not
as they are divided in the prism, or artificially manufactured for the
painter's use, but as they exist in nature, blended and confused with
one another.

we can hardly agree with him when he tells us that smells do not admit
of kinds. he seems to think that no definite qualities can attach to
bodies which are in a state of transition or evaporation; he also makes
the subtle observation that smells must be denser than air, though
thinner than water, because when there is an obstruction to the
breathing, air can penetrate, but not smell.

the affections peculiar to the tongue are of various kinds, and, like
many other affections, are caused by contraction and dilation. some of
them are produced by rough, others by abstergent, others by inflammatory
substances,--these act upon the testing instruments of the tongue, and
produce a more or less disagreeable sensation, while other particles
congenial to the tongue soften and harmonize them. the instruments of
taste reach from the tongue to the heart. plato has a lively sense of
the manner in which sensation and motion are communicated from one part
of the body to the other, though he confuses the affections with the
organs. hearing is a blow which passes through the ear and ends in the
region of the liver, being transmitted by means of the air, the brain,
and the blood to the soul. the swifter sound is acute, the sound which
moves slowly is grave. a great body of sound is loud, the opposite
is low. discord is produced by the swifter and slower motions of two
sounds, and is converted into harmony when the swifter motions begin to
pause and are overtaken by the slower.

the general phenomena of sensation are partly internal, but the more
violent are caused by conflict with external objects. proceeding by a
method of superficial observation, plato remarks that the more sensitive
parts of the human frame are those which are least covered by flesh,
as is the case with the head and the elbows. man, if his head had been
covered with a thicker pulp of flesh, might have been a longer-lived
animal than he is, but could not have had as quick perceptions. on the
other hand, the tongue is one of the most sensitive of organs; but then
this is made, not to be a covering to the bones which contain the marrow
or source of life, but with an express purpose, and in a separate mass.

section 8.

we have now to consider how far in any of these speculations plato
approximated to the discoveries of modern science. the modern physical
philosopher is apt to dwell exclusively on the absurdities of ancient
ideas about science, on the haphazard fancies and a priori assumptions
of ancient teachers, on their confusion of facts and ideas, on their
inconsistency and blindness to the most obvious phenomena. he measures
them not by what preceded them, but by what has followed them. he does
not consider that ancient physical philosophy was not a free enquiry,
but a growth, in which the mind was passive rather than active, and
was incapable of resisting the impressions which flowed in upon it.
he hardly allows to the notions of the ancients the merit of being the
stepping-stones by which he has himself risen to a higher knowledge. he
never reflects, how great a thing it was to have formed a conception,
however imperfect, either of the human frame as a whole, or of the world
as a whole. according to the view taken in these volumes the errors of
ancient physicists were not separable from the intellectual conditions
under which they lived. their genius was their own; and they were not
the rash and hasty generalizers which, since the days of bacon, we
have been apt to suppose them. the thoughts of men widened to receive
experience; at first they seemed to know all things as in a dream: after
a while they look at them closely and hold them in their hands. they
begin to arrange them in classes and to connect causes with effects.
general notions are necessary to the apprehension of particular facts,
the metaphysical to the physical. before men can observe the world, they
must be able to conceive it.

to do justice to the subject, we should consider the physical philosophy
of the ancients as a whole; we should remember, (1) that the nebular
theory was the received belief of several of the early physicists; (2)
that the development of animals out of fishes who came to land, and of
man out of the animals, was held by anaximander in the sixth century
before christ (plut. symp. quaest; plac. phil.); (3) that even by
philolaus and the early pythagoreans, the earth was held to be a body
like the other stars revolving in space around the sun or a central
fire; (4) that the beginnings of chemistry are discernible in the
'similar particles' of anaxagoras. also they knew or thought (5) that
there was a sex in plants as well as in animals; (6) they were aware
that musical notes depended on the relative length or tension of the
strings from which they were emitted, and were measured by ratios
of number; (7) that mathematical laws pervaded the world; and even
qualitative differences were supposed to have their origin in number and
figure; (8) the annihilation of matter was denied by several of them,
and the seeming disappearance of it held to be a transformation only.
for, although one of these discoveries might have been supposed to be
a happy guess, taken together they seem to imply a great advance and
almost maturity of natural knowledge.

we should also remember, when we attribute to the ancients hasty
generalizations and delusions of language, that physical philosophy and
metaphysical too have been guilty of similar fallacies in quite recent
times. we by no means distinguish clearly between mind and body, between
ideas and facts. have not many discussions arisen about the atomic
theory in which a point has been confused with a material atom? have not
the natures of things been explained by imaginary entities, such as
life or phlogiston, which exist in the mind only? has not disease been
regarded, like sin, sometimes as a negative and necessary, sometimes as
a positive or malignant principle? the 'idols' of bacon are nearly as
common now as ever; they are inherent in the human mind, and when they
have the most complete dominion over us, we are least able to perceive
them. we recognize them in the ancients, but we fail to see them in
ourselves.

such reflections, although this is not the place in which to dwell upon
them at length, lead us to take a favourable view of the speculations
of the timaeus. we should consider not how much plato actually knew, but
how far he has contributed to the general ideas of physics, or supplied
the notions which, whether true or false, have stimulated the minds
of later generations in the path of discovery. some of them may seem
old-fashioned, but may nevertheless have had a great influence in
promoting system and assisting enquiry, while in others we hear the
latest word of physical or metaphysical philosophy. there is also an
intermediate class, in which plato falls short of the truths of modern
science, though he is not wholly unacquainted with them. (1) to the
first class belongs the teleological theory of creation. whether all
things in the world can be explained as the result of natural laws, or
whether we must not admit of tendencies and marks of design also, has
been a question much disputed of late years. even if all phenomena are
the result of natural forces, we must admit that there are many things
in heaven and earth which are as well expressed under the image of mind
or design as under any other. at any rate, the language of plato has
been the language of natural theology down to our own time, nor can any
description of the world wholly dispense with it. the notion of first
and second or co-operative causes, which originally appears in the
timaeus, has likewise survived to our own day, and has been a great
peace-maker between theology and science. plato also approaches very
near to our doctrine of the primary and secondary qualities of matter.
(2) another popular notion which is found in the timaeus, is the
feebleness of the human intellect--'god knows the original qualities of
things; man can only hope to attain to probability.' we speak in almost
the same words of human intelligence, but not in the same manner of the
uncertainty of our knowledge of nature. the reason is that the latter is
assured to us by experiment, and is not contrasted with the certainty
of ideal or mathematical knowledge. but the ancient philosopher never
experimented: in the timaeus plato seems to have thought that there
would be impiety in making the attempt; he, for example, who tried
experiments in colours would 'forget the difference of the human and
divine natures.' their indefiniteness is probably the reason why he
singles them out, as especially incapable of being tested by experiment.
(compare the saying of anaxagoras--sext. pyrrh.--that since snow is made
of water and water is black, snow ought to be black.)

the greatest 'divination' of the ancients was the supremacy which they
assigned to mathematics in all the realms of nature; for in all of them
there is a foundation of mechanics. even physiology partakes of figure
and number; and plato is not wrong in attributing them to the human
frame, but in the omission to observe how little could be explained by
them. thus we may remark in passing that the most fanciful of ancient
philosophies is also the most nearly verified in fact. the fortunate
guess that the world is a sum of numbers and figures has been the most
fruitful of anticipations. the 'diatonic' scale of the pythagoreans
and plato suggested to kepler that the secret of the distances of the
planets from one another was to be found in mathematical proportions.
the doctrine that the heavenly bodies all move in a circle is known by
us to be erroneous; but without such an error how could the human mind
have comprehended the heavens? astronomy, even in modern times, has
made far greater progress by the high a priori road than could have been
attained by any other. yet, strictly speaking--and the remark applies
to ancient physics generally--this high a priori road was based upon a
posteriori grounds. for there were no facts of which the ancients were
so well assured by experience as facts of number. having observed that
they held good in a few instances, they applied them everywhere; and in
the complexity, of which they were capable, found the explanation of the
equally complex phenomena of the universe. they seemed to see them in
the least things as well as in the greatest; in atoms, as well as in
suns and stars; in the human body as well as in external nature. and
now a favourite speculation of modern chemistry is the explanation of
qualitative difference by quantitative, which is at present verified to
a certain extent and may hereafter be of far more universal application.
what is this but the atoms of democritus and the triangles of plato? the
ancients should not be wholly deprived of the credit of their guesses
because they were unable to prove them. may they not have had, like the
animals, an instinct of something more than they knew?

besides general notions we seem to find in the timaeus some more precise
approximations to the discoveries of modern physical science. first,
the doctrine of equipoise. plato affirms, almost in so many words, that
nature abhors a vacuum. whenever a particle is displaced, the rest push
and thrust one another until equality is restored. we must remember that
these ideas were not derived from any definite experiment, but were the
original reflections of man, fresh from the first observation of nature.
the latest word of modern philosophy is continuity and development,
but to plato this is the beginning and foundation of science; there is
nothing that he is so strongly persuaded of as that the world is one,
and that all the various existences which are contained in it are only
the transformations of the same soul of the world acting on the same
matter. he would have readily admitted that out of the protoplasm all
things were formed by the gradual process of creation; but he would have
insisted that mind and intelligence--not meaning by this, however,
a conscious mind or person--were prior to them, and could alone have
created them. into the workings of this eternal mind or intelligence he
does not enter further; nor would there have been any use in attempting
to investigate the things which no eye has seen nor any human language
can express.

lastly, there remain two points in which he seems to touch great
discoveries of modern times--the law of gravitation, and the circulation
of the blood.

(1) the law of gravitation, according to plato, is a law, not only of
the attraction of lesser bodies to larger ones, but of similar bodies to
similar, having a magnetic power as well as a principle of gravitation.
he observed that earth, water, and air had settled down to their places,
and he imagined fire or the exterior aether to have a place beyond air.
when air seemed to go upwards and fire to pierce through air--when water
and earth fell downward, they were seeking their native elements. he did
not remark that his own explanation did not suit all phenomena; and the
simpler explanation, which assigns to bodies degrees of heaviness and
lightness proportioned to the mass and distance of the bodies which
attract them, never occurred to him. yet the affinities of similar
substances have some effect upon the composition of the world, and
of this plato may be thought to have had an anticipation. he may be
described as confusing the attraction of gravitation with the attraction
of cohesion. the influence of such affinities and the chemical action of
one body upon another in long periods of time have become a recognized
principle of geology.

(2) plato is perfectly aware--and he could hardly be ignorant--that
blood is a fluid in constant motion. he also knew that blood is partly a
solid substance consisting of several elements, which, as he might have
observed in the use of 'cupping-glasses', decompose and die, when no
longer in motion. but the specific discovery that the blood flows out on
one side of the heart through the arteries and returns through the veins
on the other, which is commonly called the circulation of the blood, was
absolutely unknown to him.

a further study of the timaeus suggests some after-thoughts which may be
conveniently brought together in this place. the topics which i propose
briefly to reconsider are (a) the relation of the timaeus to the other
dialogues of plato and to the previous philosophy; (b) the nature of god
and of creation (c) the morality of the timaeus:--

(a) the timaeus is more imaginative and less scientific than any other
of the platonic dialogues. it is conjectural astronomy, conjectural
natural philosophy, conjectural medicine. the writer himself is
constantly repeating that he is speaking what is probable only. the
dialogue is put into the mouth of timaeus, a pythagorean philosopher,
and therefore here, as in the parmenides, we are in doubt how far plato
is expressing his own sentiments. hence the connexion with the other
dialogues is comparatively slight. we may fill up the lacunae of the
timaeus by the help of the republic or phaedrus: we may identify the
same and other with the (greek) of the philebus. we may find in the laws
or in the statesman parallels with the account of creation and of the
first origin of man. it would be possible to frame a scheme in which all
these various elements might have a place. but such a mode of proceeding
would be unsatisfactory, because we have no reason to suppose that plato
intended his scattered thoughts to be collected in a system. there is a
common spirit in his writings, and there are certain general principles,
such as the opposition of the sensible and intellectual, and the
priority of mind, which run through all of them; but he has no definite
forms of words in which he consistently expresses himself. while
the determinations of human thought are in process of creation he is
necessarily tentative and uncertain. and there is least of definiteness,
whenever either in describing the beginning or the end of the world, he
has recourse to myths. these are not the fixed modes in which spiritual
truths are revealed to him, but the efforts of imagination, by which
at different times and in various manners he seeks to embody his
conceptions. the clouds of mythology are still resting upon him, and he
has not yet pierced 'to the heaven of the fixed stars' which is beyond
them. it is safer then to admit the inconsistencies of the timaeus,
or to endeavour to fill up what is wanting from our own imagination,
inspired by a study of the dialogue, than to refer to other platonic
writings,--and still less should we refer to the successors of
plato,--for the elucidation of it.

more light is thrown upon the timaeus by a comparison of the previous
philosophies. for the physical science of the ancients was traditional,
descending through many generations of ionian and pythagorean
philosophers. plato does not look out upon the heavens and describe what
he sees in them, but he builds upon the foundations of others, adding
something out of the 'depths of his own self-consciousness.' socrates
had already spoken of god the creator, who made all things for the best.
while he ridiculed the superficial explanations of phenomena which were
current in his age, he recognised the marks both of benevolence and of
design in the frame of man and in the world. the apparatus of winds and
waters is contemptuously rejected by him in the phaedo, but he thinks
that there is a power greater than that of any atlas in the 'best'
(phaedo; arist. met.). plato, following his master, affirms this
principle of the best, but he acknowledges that the best is limited by
the conditions of matter. in the generation before socrates, anaxagoras
had brought together 'chaos' and 'mind'; and these are connected by
plato in the timaeus, but in accordance with his own mode of thinking he
has interposed between them the idea or pattern according to which mind
worked. the circular impulse (greek) of the one philosopher answers to
the circular movement (greek) of the other. but unlike anaxagoras, plato
made the sun and stars living beings and not masses of earth or metal.
the pythagoreans again had framed a world out of numbers, which they
constructed into figures. plato adopted their speculations and improved
upon them by a more exact knowledge of geometry. the atomists too made
the world, if not out of geometrical figures, at least out of different
forms of atoms, and these atoms resembled the triangles of plato in
being too small to be visible. but though the physiology of the timaeus
is partly borrowed from them, they are either ignored by plato or
referred to with a secret contempt and dislike. he looks with more
favour on the pythagoreans, whose intervals of number applied to the
distances of the planets reappear in the timaeus. it is probable that
among the pythagoreans living in the fourth century b.c., there were
already some who, like plato, made the earth their centre. whether he
obtained his circles of the same and other from any previous thinker is
uncertain. the four elements are taken from empedocles; the interstices
of the timaeus may also be compared with his (greek). the passage of one
element into another is common to heracleitus and several of the ionian
philosophers. so much of a syncretist is plato, though not after the
manner of the neoplatonists. for the elements which he borrows from
others are fused and transformed by his own genius. on the other hand
we find fewer traces in plato of early ionic or eleatic speculation. he
does not imagine the world of sense to be made up of opposites or to
be in a perpetual flux, but to vary within certain limits which are
controlled by what he calls the principle of the same. unlike the
eleatics, who relegated the world to the sphere of not-being, he admits
creation to have an existence which is real and even eternal, although
dependent on the will of the creator. instead of maintaining the
doctrine that the void has a necessary place in the existence of the
world, he rather affirms the modern thesis that nature abhors a vacuum,
as in the sophist he also denies the reality of not-being (aristot.
metaph.). but though in these respects he differs from them, he is
deeply penetrated by the spirit of their philosophy; he differs from
them with reluctance, and gladly recognizes the 'generous depth' of
parmenides (theaet.).

there is a similarity between the timaeus and the fragments of
philolaus, which by some has been thought to be so great as to create a
suspicion that they are derived from it. philolaus is known to us from
the phaedo of plato as a pythagorean philosopher residing at thebes in
the latter half of the fifth century b.c., after the dispersion of the
original pythagorean society. he was the teacher of simmias and cebes,
who became disciples of socrates. we have hardly any other information
about him. the story that plato had purchased three books of his
writings from a relation is not worth repeating; it is only a fanciful
way in which an ancient biographer dresses up the fact that there was
supposed to be a resemblance between the two writers. similar gossiping
stories are told about the sources of the republic and the phaedo.
that there really existed in antiquity a work passing under the name of
philolaus there can be no doubt. fragments of this work are preserved
to us, chiefly in stobaeus, a few in boethius and other writers. they
remind us of the timaeus, as well as of the phaedrus and philebus.
when the writer says (stob. eclog.) that all things are either finite
(definite) or infinite (indefinite), or a union of the two, and that
this antithesis and synthesis pervades all art and nature, we are
reminded of the philebus. when he calls the centre of the world (greek),
we have a parallel to the phaedrus. his distinction between the world of
order, to which the sun and moon and the stars belong, and the world
of disorder, which lies in the region between the moon and the earth,
approximates to plato's sphere of the same and of the other. like plato
(tim.), he denied the above and below in space, and said that all things
were the same in relation to a centre. he speaks also of the world as
one and indestructible: 'for neither from within nor from without
does it admit of destruction' (tim). he mentions ten heavenly bodies,
including the sun and moon, the earth and the counter-earth (greek), and
in the midst of them all he places the central fire, around which they
are moving--this is hidden from the earth by the counter-earth. of
neither is there any trace in plato, who makes the earth the centre
of his system. philolaus magnifies the virtues of particular numbers,
especially of the number 10 (stob. eclog.), and descants upon odd and
even numbers, after the manner of the later pythagoreans. it is worthy
of remark that these mystical fancies are nowhere to be found in the
writings of plato, although the importance of number as a form and also
an instrument of thought is ever present to his mind. both philolaus
and plato agree in making the world move in certain numerical ratios
according to a musical scale: though bockh is of opinion that the two
scales, of philolaus and of the timaeus, do not correspond...we appear
not to be sufficiently acquainted with the early pythagoreans to know
how far the statements contained in these fragments corresponded with
their doctrines; and we therefore cannot pronounce, either in favour
of the genuineness of the fragments, with bockh and zeller, or, with
valentine rose and schaarschmidt, against them. but it is clear that
they throw but little light upon the timaeus, and that their resemblance
to it has been exaggerated.

that there is a degree of confusion and indistinctness in plato's
account both of man and of the universe has been already acknowledged.
we cannot tell (nor could plato himself have told) where the figure or
myth ends and the philosophical truth begins; we cannot explain (nor
could plato himself have explained to us) the relation of the ideas to
appearance, of which one is the copy of the other, and yet of all things
in the world they are the most opposed and unlike. this opposition is
presented to us in many forms, as the antithesis of the one and many,
of the finite and infinite, of the intelligible and sensible, of the
unchangeable and the changing, of the indivisible and the divisible, of
the fixed stars and the planets, of the creative mind and the primeval
chaos. these pairs of opposites are so many aspects of the great
opposition between ideas and phenomena--they easily pass into one
another; and sometimes the two members of the relation differ in
kind, sometimes only in degree. as in aristotle's matter and form the
connexion between them is really inseparable; for if we attempt
to separate them they become devoid of content and therefore
indistinguishable; there is no difference between the idea of which
nothing can be predicated, and the chaos or matter which has no
perceptible qualities--between being in the abstract and nothing. yet
we are frequently told that the one class of them is the reality and the
other appearance; and one is often spoken of as the double or reflection
of the other. for plato never clearly saw that both elements had an
equal place in mind and in nature; and hence, especially when we argue
from isolated passages in his writings, or attempt to draw what appear
to us to be the natural inferences from them, we are full of perplexity.
there is a similar confusion about necessity and free-will, and about
the state of the soul after death. also he sometimes supposes that god
is immanent in the world, sometimes that he is transcendent. and having
no distinction of objective and subjective, he passes imperceptibly
from one to the other; from intelligence to soul, from eternity to time.
these contradictions may be softened or concealed by a judicious use
of language, but they cannot be wholly got rid of. that an age of
intellectual transition must also be one of inconsistency; that the
creative is opposed to the critical or defining habit of mind or time,
has been often repeated by us. but, as plato would say, 'there is no
harm in repeating twice or thrice' (laws) what is important for the
understanding of a great author.

it has not, however, been observed, that the confusion partly arises out
of the elements of opposing philosophies which are preserved in him. he
holds these in solution, he brings them into relation with one another,
but he does not perfectly harmonize them. they are part of his own mind,
and he is incapable of placing himself outside of them and criticizing
them. they grow as he grows; they are a kind of composition with which
his own philosophy is overlaid. in early life he fancies that he
has mastered them: but he is also mastered by them; and in language
(sophist) which may be compared with the hesitating tone of the timaeus,
he confesses in his later years that they are full of obscurity to him.
he attributes new meanings to the words of parmenides and heracleitus;
but at times the old eleatic philosophy appears to go beyond him; then
the world of phenomena disappears, but the doctrine of ideas is also
reduced to nothingness. all of them are nearer to one another than they
themselves supposed, and nearer to him than he supposed. all of them are
antagonistic to sense and have an affinity to number and measure and a
presentiment of ideas. even in plato they still retain their contentious
or controversial character, which was developed by the growth of
dialectic. he is never able to reconcile the first causes of the
pre-socratic philosophers with the final causes of socrates himself.
there is no intelligible account of the relation of numbers to the
universal ideas, or of universals to the idea of good. he found them all
three, in the pythagorean philosophy and in the teaching of socrates and
of the megarians respectively; and, because they all furnished modes of
explaining and arranging phenomena, he is unwilling to give up any of
them, though he is unable to unite them in a consistent whole.

lastly, plato, though an idealist philosopher, is greek and not oriental
in spirit and feeling. he is no mystic or ascetic; he is not seeking in
vain to get rid of matter or to find absorption in the divine nature, or
in the soul of the universe. and therefore we are not surprised to find
that his philosophy in the timaeus returns at last to a worship of the
heavens, and that to him, as to other greeks, nature, though containing
a remnant of evil, is still glorious and divine. he takes away or drops
the veil of mythology, and presents her to us in what appears to him to
be the form-fairer and truer far--of mathematical figures. it is this
element in the timaeus, no less than its affinity to certain pythagorean
speculations, which gives it a character not wholly in accordance with
the other dialogues of plato.

(b) the timaeus contains an assertion perhaps more distinct than is
found in any of the other dialogues (rep.; laws) of the goodness of god.
'he was good himself, and he fashioned the good everywhere.' he was not
'a jealous god,' and therefore he desired that all other things should
be equally good. he is the idea of good who has now become a person, and
speaks and is spoken of as god. yet his personality seems to appear only
in the act of creation. in so far as he works with his eye fixed upon an
eternal pattern he is like the human artificer in the republic. here the
theory of platonic ideas intrudes upon us. god, like man, is supposed to
have an ideal of which plato is unable to tell us the origin. he may be
said, in the language of modern philosophy, to resolve the divine mind
into subject and object.

the first work of creation is perfected, the second begins under the
direction of inferior ministers. the supreme god is withdrawn from
the world and returns to his own accustomed nature (tim.). as in the
statesman, he retires to his place of view. so early did the epicurean
doctrine take possession of the greek mind, and so natural is it to the
heart of man, when he has once passed out of the stage of mythology into
that of rational religion. for he sees the marks of design in the world;
but he no longer sees or fancies that he sees god walking in the garden
or haunting stream or mountain. he feels also that he must put god as
far as possible out of the way of evil, and therefore he banishes him
from an evil world. plato is sensible of the difficulty; and he often
shows that he is desirous of justifying the ways of god to man. yet on
the other hand, in the tenth book of the laws he passes a censure on
those who say that the gods have no care of human things.

the creation of the world is the impression of order on a previously
existing chaos. the formula of anaxagoras--'all things were in chaos or
confusion, and then mind came and disposed them'--is a summary of
the first part of the timaeus. it is true that of a chaos without
differences no idea could be formed. all was not mixed but one;
and therefore it was not difficult for the later platonists to draw
inferences by which they were enabled to reconcile the narrative of the
timaeus with the mosaic account of the creation. neither when we
speak of mind or intelligence, do we seem to get much further in
our conception than circular motion, which was deemed to be the most
perfect. plato, like anaxagoras, while commencing his theory of the
universe with ideas of mind and of the best, is compelled in the
execution of his design to condescend to the crudest physics.

(c) the morality of the timaeus is singular, and it is difficult to
adjust the balance between the two elements of it. the difficulty which
plato feels, is that which all of us feel, and which is increased in our
own day by the progress of physical science, how the responsibility
of man is to be reconciled with his dependence on natural causes. and
sometimes, like other men, he is more impressed by one aspect of human
life, sometimes by the other. in the republic he represents man as
freely choosing his own lot in a state prior to birth--a conception
which, if taken literally, would still leave him subject to the dominion
of necessity in his after life; in the statesman he supposes the human
race to be preserved in the world only by a divine interposition; while
in the timaeus the supreme god commissions the inferior deities to avert
from him all but self-inflicted evils--words which imply that all
the evils of men are really self-inflicted. and here, like plato (the
insertion of a note in the text of an ancient writer is a literary
curiosity worthy of remark), we may take occasion to correct an error.
for we too hastily said that plato in the timaeus regarded all 'vices
and crimes as involuntary.' but the fact is that he is inconsistent
with himself; in one and the same passage vice is attributed to the
relaxation of the bodily frame, and yet we are exhorted to avoid it and
pursue virtue. it is also admitted that good and evil conduct are to be
attributed respectively to good and evil laws and institutions. these
cannot be given by individuals to themselves; and therefore human
actions, in so far as they are dependent upon them, are regarded by
plato as involuntary rather than voluntary. like other writers on this
subject, he is unable to escape from some degree of self-contradiction.
he had learned from socrates that vice is ignorance, and suddenly the
doctrine seems to him to be confirmed by observing how much of the good
and bad in human character depends on the bodily constitution. so
in modern times the speculative doctrine of necessity has often been
supported by physical facts.

the timaeus also contains an anticipation of the stoical life according
to nature. man contemplating the heavens is to regulate his erring life
according to them. he is to partake of the repose of nature and of the
order of nature, to bring the variable principle in himself into harmony
with the principle of the same. the ethics of the timaeus may be summed
up in the single idea of 'law.' to feel habitually that he is part of
the order of the universe, is one of the highest ethical motives of
which man is capable. something like this is what plato means when he
speaks of the soul 'moving about the same in unchanging thought of
the same.' he does not explain how man is acted upon by the lesser
influences of custom or of opinion; or how the commands of the soul
watching in the citadel are conveyed to the bodily organs. but this
perhaps, to use once more expressions of his own, 'is part of another
subject' or 'may be more suitably discussed on some other occasion.'

there is no difficulty, by the help of aristotle and later writers, in
criticizing the timaeus of plato, in pointing out the inconsistencies
of the work, in dwelling on the ignorance of anatomy displayed by the
author, in showing the fancifulness or unmeaningness of some of his
reasons. but the timaeus still remains the greatest effort of the human
mind to conceive the world as a whole which the genius of antiquity has
bequeathed to us.

*****

one more aspect of the timaeus remains to be considered--the
mythological or geographical. is it not a wonderful thing that a few
pages of one of plato's dialogues have grown into a great legend, not
confined to greece only, but spreading far and wide over the nations of
europe and reaching even to egypt and asia? like the tale of troy,
or the legend of the ten tribes (ewald, hist. of isr.), which perhaps
originated in a few verses of ii esdras, it has become famous, because
it has coincided with a great historical fact. like the romance of king
arthur, which has had so great a charm, it has found a way over the seas
from one country and language to another. it inspired the navigators of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; it foreshadowed the discovery of
america. it realized the fiction so natural to the human mind, because
it answered the enquiry about the origin of the arts, that there had
somewhere existed an ancient primitive civilization. it might find a
place wherever men chose to look for it; in north, south, east, or
west; in the islands of the blest; before the entrance of the straits
of gibraltar, in sweden or in palestine. it mattered little whether the
description in plato agreed with the locality assigned to it or not. it
was a legend so adapted to the human mind that it made a habitation for
itself in any country. it was an island in the clouds, which might be
seen anywhere by the eye of faith. it was a subject especially congenial
to the ponderous industry of certain french and swedish writers, who
delighted in heaping up learning of all sorts but were incapable of
using it.

m. martin has written a valuable dissertation on the opinions
entertained respecting the island of atlantis in ancient and modern
times. it is a curious chapter in the history of the human mind. the
tale of atlantis is the fabric of a vision, but it has never ceased to
interest mankind. it was variously regarded by the ancients themselves.
the stronger heads among them, like strabo and longinus, were as little
disposed to believe in the truth of it as the modern reader in gulliver
or robinson crusoe. on the other hand there is no kind or degree of
absurdity or fancy in which the more foolish writers, both of
antiquity and of modern times, have not indulged respecting it. the
neo-platonists, loyal to their master, like some commentators on the
christian scriptures, sought to give an allegorical meaning to what they
also believed to be an historical fact. it was as if some one in our own
day were to convert the poems of homer into an allegory of the christian
religion, at the same time maintaining them to be an exact and veritable
history. in the middle ages the legend seems to have been half-forgotten
until revived by the discovery of america. it helped to form the utopia
of sir thomas more and the new atlantis of bacon, although probably
neither of those great men were at all imposed upon by the fiction.
it was most prolific in the seventeenth or in the early part of
the eighteenth century, when the human mind, seeking for utopias or
inventing them, was glad to escape out of the dulness of the present
into the romance of the past or some ideal of the future. the later
forms of such narratives contained features taken from the edda, as well
as from the old and new testament; also from the tales of missionaries
and the experiences of travellers and of colonists.

the various opinions respecting the island of atlantis have no interest
for us except in so far as they illustrate the extravagances of which
men are capable. but this is a real interest and a serious lesson, if
we remember that now as formerly the human mind is liable to be imposed
upon by the illusions of the past, which are ever assuming some new
form.

when we have shaken off the rubbish of ages, there remain one or two
questions of which the investigation has a permanent value:--

1. did plato derive the legend of atlantis from an egyptian source? it
may be replied that there is no such legend in any writer previous to
plato; neither in homer, nor in pindar, nor in herodotus is there any
mention of an island of atlantis, nor any reference to it in aristotle,
nor any citation of an earlier writer by a later one in which it is
to be found. nor have any traces been discovered hitherto in egyptian
monuments of a connexion between greece and egypt older than the eighth
or ninth century b.c. it is true that proclus, writing in the fifth
century after christ, tells us of stones and columns in egypt on which
the history of the island of atlantis was engraved. the statement may be
false--there are similar tales about columns set up 'by the canaanites
whom joshua drove out' (procop.); but even if true, it would only show
that the legend, 800 years after the time of plato, had been transferred
to egypt, and inscribed, not, like other forgeries, in books, but on
stone. probably in the alexandrian age, when egypt had ceased to have a
history and began to appropriate the legends of other nations, many such
monuments were to be found of events which had become famous in that or
other countries. the oldest witness to the story is said to be crantor,
a stoic philosopher who lived a generation later than plato, and
therefore may have borrowed it from him. the statement is found in
proclus; but we require better assurance than proclus can give us before
we accept this or any other statement which he makes.

secondly, passing from the external to the internal evidence, we may
remark that the story is far more likely to have been invented by plato
than to have been brought by solon from egypt. that is another part of
his legend which plato also seeks to impose upon us. the verisimilitude
which he has given to the tale is a further reason for suspecting it;
for he could easily 'invent egyptian or any other tales' (phaedrus). are
not the words, 'the truth of the story is a great advantage,' if we read
between the lines, an indication of the fiction? it is only a legend
that solon went to egypt, and if he did he could not have conversed with
egyptian priests or have read records in their temples. the truth is
that the introduction is a mosaic work of small touches which, partly
by their minuteness, and also by their seeming probability, win the
confidence of the reader. who would desire better evidence than that
of critias, who had heard the narrative in youth when the memory is
strongest at the age of ten from his grandfather critias, an old man of
ninety, who in turn had heard it from solon himself? is not the famous
expression--'you hellenes are ever children and there is no knowledge
among you hoary with age,' really a compliment to the athenians who are
described in these words as 'ever young'? and is the thought expressed
in them to be attributed to the learning of the egyptian priest, and not
rather to the genius of plato? or when the egyptian says--'hereafter at
our leisure we will take up the written documents and examine in detail
the exact truth about these things'--what is this but a literary trick
by which plato sets off his narrative? could any war between athens and
the island of atlantis have really coincided with the struggle between
the greeks and persians, as is sufficiently hinted though not expressly
stated in the narrative of plato? and whence came the tradition to
egypt? or in what does the story consist except in the war between the
two rival powers and the submersion of both of them? and how was the
tale transferred to the poem of solon? 'it is not improbable,' says mr.
grote, 'that solon did leave an unfinished egyptian poem' (plato). but
are probabilities for which there is not a tittle of evidence, and
which are without any parallel, to be deemed worthy of attention by the
critic? how came the poem of solon to disappear in antiquity? or why did
plato, if the whole narrative was known to him, break off almost at the
beginning of it?

while therefore admiring the diligence and erudition of m. martin,
we cannot for a moment suppose that the tale was told to solon by an
egyptian priest, nor can we believe that solon wrote a poem upon the
theme which was thus suggested to him--a poem which disappeared in
antiquity; or that the island of atlantis or the antediluvian athens
ever had any existence except in the imagination of plato. martin is of
opinion that plato would have been terrified if he could have foreseen
the endless fancies to which his island of atlantis has given occasion.
rather he would have been infinitely amused if he could have known that
his gift of invention would have deceived m. martin himself into the
belief that the tradition was brought from egypt by solon and made the
subject of a poem by him. m. martin may also be gently censured for
citing without sufficient discrimination ancient authors having very
different degrees of authority and value.

2. it is an interesting and not unimportant question which is touched
upon by martin, whether the atlantis of plato in any degree held out
a guiding light to the early navigators. he is inclined to think that
there is no real connexion between them. but surely the discovery of the
new world was preceded by a prophetic anticipation of it, which, like
the hope of a messiah, was entering into the hearts of men? and this
hope was nursed by ancient tradition, which had found expression from
time to time in the celebrated lines of seneca and in many other places.
this tradition was sustained by the great authority of plato, and
therefore the legend of the island of atlantis, though not closely
connected with the voyages of the early navigators, may be truly said to
have contributed indirectly to the great discovery.

the timaeus of plato, like the protagoras and several portions of the
phaedrus and republic, was translated by cicero into latin. about a
fourth, comprehending with lacunae the first portion of the dialogue,
is preserved in several mss. these generally agree, and therefore may
be supposed to be derived from a single original. the version is very
faithful, and is a remarkable monument of cicero's skill in managing the
difficult and intractable greek. in his treatise de natura deorum, he
also refers to the timaeus, which, speaking in the person of velleius
the epicurean, he severely criticises.

the commentary of proclus on the timaeus is a wonderful monument of
the silliness and prolixity of the alexandrian age. it extends to
about thirty pages of the book, and is thirty times the length of the
original. it is surprising that this voluminous work should have found
a translator (thomas taylor, a kindred spirit, who was himself a
neo-platonist, after the fashion, not of the fifth or sixteenth, but of
the nineteenth century a.d.). the commentary is of little or no value,
either in a philosophical or philological point of view. the writer is
unable to explain particular passages in any precise manner, and he is
equally incapable of grasping the whole. he does not take words in their
simple meaning or sentences in their natural connexion. he is thinking,
not of the context in plato, but of the contemporary pythagorean
philosophers and their wordy strife. he finds nothing in the text
which he does not bring to it. he is full of porphyry, iamblichus and
plotinus, of misapplied logic, of misunderstood grammar, and of the
orphic theology.

although such a work can contribute little or nothing to the
understanding of plato, it throws an interesting light on the
alexandrian times; it realizes how a philosophy made up of words only
may create a deep and widespread enthusiasm, how the forms of logic and
rhetoric may usurp the place of reason and truth, how all philosophies
grow faded and discoloured, and are patched and made up again like
worn-out garments, and retain only a second-hand existence. he who
would study this degeneracy of philosophy and of the greek mind in the
original cannot do better than devote a few of his days and nights to
the commentary of proclus on the timaeus.

a very different account must be given of the short work entitled
'timaeus locrus,' which is a brief but clear analysis of the timaeus
of plato, omitting the introduction or dialogue and making a few small
additions. it does not allude to the original from which it is taken;
it is quite free from mysticism and neo-platonism. in length it does not
exceed a fifth part of the timaeus. it is written in the doric dialect,
and contains several words which do not occur in classical greek. no
other indication of its date, except this uncertain one of language,
appears in it. in several places the writer has simplified the language
of plato, in a few others he has embellished and exaggerated it. he
generally preserves the thought of the original, but does not copy the
words. on the whole this little tract faithfully reflects the meaning
and spirit of the timaeus.

from the garden of the timaeus, as from the other dialogues of plato,
we may still gather a few flowers and present them at parting to
the reader. there is nothing in plato grander and simpler than the
conversation between solon and the egyptian priest, in which the
youthfulness of hellas is contrasted with the antiquity of egypt. here
are to be found the famous words, 'o solon, solon, you hellenes are ever
young, and there is not an old man among you'--which may be compared
to the lively saying of hegel, that 'greek history began with the youth
achilles and left off with the youth alexander.' the numerous arts of
verisimilitude by which plato insinuates into the mind of the reader
the truth of his narrative have been already referred to. here occur
a sentence or two not wanting in platonic irony (greek--a word to the
wise). 'to know or tell the origin of the other divinities is beyond
us, and we must accept the traditions of the men of old time who affirm
themselves to be the offspring of the gods--that is what they say--and
they must surely have known their own ancestors. how can we doubt the
word of the children of the gods? although they give no probable or
certain proofs, still, as they declare that they are speaking of what
took place in their own family, we must conform to custom and believe
them.' 'our creators well knew that women and other animals would some
day be framed out of men, and they further knew that many animals would
require the use of nails for many purposes; wherefore they fashioned in
men at their first creation the rudiments of nails.' or once more, let
us reflect on two serious passages in which the order of the world is
supposed to find a place in the human soul and to infuse harmony
into it. 'the soul, when touching anything that has essence, whether
dispersed in parts or undivided, is stirred through all her powers to
declare the sameness or difference of that thing and some other; and to
what individuals are related, and by what affected, and in what way
and how and when, both in the world of generation and in the world of
immutable being. and when reason, which works with equal truth, whether
she be in the circle of the diverse or of the same,--in voiceless
silence holding her onward course in the sphere of the self-moved,--when
reason, i say, is hovering around the sensible world, and when the
circle of the diverse also moving truly imparts the intimations of sense
to the whole soul, then arise opinions and beliefs sure and certain. but
when reason is concerned with the rational, and the circle of the
same moving smoothly declares it, then intelligence and knowledge
are necessarily perfected;' where, proceeding in a similar path of
contemplation, he supposes the inward and the outer world mutually to
imply each other. 'god invented and gave us sight to the end that we
might behold the courses of intelligence in the heaven, and apply them
to the courses of our own intelligence which are akin to them, the
unperturbed to the perturbed; and that we, learning them and partaking
of the natural truth of reason, might imitate the absolutely unerring
courses of god and regulate our own vagaries.' or let us weigh carefully
some other profound thoughts, such as the following. 'he who neglects
education walks lame to the end of his life, and returns imperfect and
good for nothing to the world below.' 'the father and maker of all this
universe is past finding out; and even if we found him, to tell of him
to all men would be impossible.' 'let me tell you then why the creator
made this world of generation. he was good, and the good can never have
jealousy of anything. and being free from jealousy, he desired that all
things should be as like himself as they could be. this is in the truest
sense the origin of creation and of the world, as we shall do well in
believing on the testimony of wise men: god desired that all things
should be good and nothing bad, so far as this was attainable.' this
is the leading thought in the timaeus, just as the idea of good is
the leading thought of the republic, the one expression describing the
personal, the other the impersonal good or god, differing in form rather
than in substance, and both equally implying to the mind of plato a
divine reality. the slight touch, perhaps ironical, contained in the
words, 'as we shall do well in believing on the testimony of wise men,'
is very characteristic of plato.

timaeus.


persons of the dialogue: socrates, critias, timaeus, hermocrates.


socrates: one, two, three; but where, my dear timaeus, is the fourth of
those who were yesterday my guests and are to be my entertainers to-day?

timaeus: he has been taken ill, socrates; for he would not willingly
have been absent from this gathering.

socrates: then, if he is not coming, you and the two others must supply
his place.

timaeus: certainly, and we will do all that we can; having been
handsomely entertained by you yesterday, those of us who remain should
be only too glad to return your hospitality.

socrates: do you remember what were the points of which i required you
to speak?

timaeus: we remember some of them, and you will be here to remind us
of anything which we have forgotten: or rather, if we are not troubling
you, will you briefly recapitulate the whole, and then the particulars
will be more firmly fixed in our memories?

socrates: to be sure i will: the chief theme of my yesterday's discourse
was the state--how constituted and of what citizens composed it would
seem likely to be most perfect.

timaeus: yes, socrates; and what you said of it was very much to our
mind.

socrates: did we not begin by separating the husbandmen and the artisans
from the class of defenders of the state?

timaeus: yes.

socrates: and when we had given to each one that single employment and
particular art which was suited to his nature, we spoke of those
who were intended to be our warriors, and said that they were to be
guardians of the city against attacks from within as well as from
without, and to have no other employment; they were to be merciful in
judging their subjects, of whom they were by nature friends, but fierce
to their enemies, when they came across them in battle.

timaeus: exactly.

socrates: we said, if i am not mistaken, that the guardians should
be gifted with a temperament in a high degree both passionate and
philosophical; and that then they would be as they ought to be, gentle
to their friends and fierce with their enemies.

timaeus: certainly.

socrates: and what did we say of their education? were they not to be
trained in gymnastic, and music, and all other sorts of knowledge which
were proper for them?

timaeus: very true.

socrates: and being thus trained they were not to consider gold or
silver or anything else to be their own private property; they were to
be like hired troops, receiving pay for keeping guard from those who
were protected by them--the pay was to be no more than would suffice
for men of simple life; and they were to spend in common, and to live
together in the continual practice of virtue, which was to be their sole
pursuit.

timaeus: that was also said.

socrates: neither did we forget the women; of whom we declared, that
their natures should be assimilated and brought into harmony with those
of the men, and that common pursuits should be assigned to them both in
time of war and in their ordinary life.

timaeus: that, again, was as you say.

socrates: and what about the procreation of children? or rather was not
the proposal too singular to be forgotten? for all wives and children
were to be in common, to the intent that no one should ever know his own
child, but they were to imagine that they were all one family; those
who were within a suitable limit of age were to be brothers and sisters,
those who were of an elder generation parents and grandparents, and
those of a younger, children and grandchildren.

timaeus: yes, and the proposal is easy to remember, as you say.

socrates: and do you also remember how, with a view of securing as far
as we could the best breed, we said that the chief magistrates, male
and female, should contrive secretly, by the use of certain lots, so to
arrange the nuptial meeting, that the bad of either sex and the good
of either sex might pair with their like; and there was to be no
quarrelling on this account, for they would imagine that the union was a
mere accident, and was to be attributed to the lot?

timaeus: i remember.

socrates: and you remember how we said that the children of the good
parents were to be educated, and the children of the bad secretly
dispersed among the inferior citizens; and while they were all growing
up the rulers were to be on the look-out, and to bring up from below in
their turn those who were worthy, and those among themselves who were
unworthy were to take the places of those who came up?

timaeus: true.

socrates: then have i now given you all the heads of our yesterday's
discussion? or is there anything more, my dear timaeus, which has been
omitted?

timaeus: nothing, socrates; it was just as you have said.

socrates: i should like, before proceeding further, to tell you how i
feel about the state which we have described. i might compare myself
to a person who, on beholding beautiful animals either created by the
painter's art, or, better still, alive but at rest, is seized with a
desire of seeing them in motion or engaged in some struggle or conflict
to which their forms appear suited; this is my feeling about the state
which we have been describing. there are conflicts which all cities
undergo, and i should like to hear some one tell of our own city
carrying on a struggle against her neighbours, and how she went out to
war in a becoming manner, and when at war showed by the greatness of her
actions and the magnanimity of her words in dealing with other cities
a result worthy of her training and education. now i, critias and
hermocrates, am conscious that i myself should never be able to
celebrate the city and her citizens in a befitting manner, and i am
not surprised at my own incapacity; to me the wonder is rather that
the poets present as well as past are no better--not that i mean
to depreciate them; but every one can see that they are a tribe of
imitators, and will imitate best and most easily the life in which they
have been brought up; while that which is beyond the range of a man's
education he finds hard to carry out in action, and still harder
adequately to represent in language. i am aware that the sophists have
plenty of brave words and fair conceits, but i am afraid that being only
wanderers from one city to another, and having never had habitations
of their own, they may fail in their conception of philosophers and
statesmen, and may not know what they do and say in time of war, when
they are fighting or holding parley with their enemies. and thus people
of your class are the only ones remaining who are fitted by nature and
education to take part at once both in politics and philosophy. here is
timaeus, of locris in italy, a city which has admirable laws, and who is
himself in wealth and rank the equal of any of his fellow-citizens; he
has held the most important and honourable offices in his own state,
and, as i believe, has scaled the heights of all philosophy; and here
is critias, whom every athenian knows to be no novice in the matters
of which we are speaking; and as to hermocrates, i am assured by many
witnesses that his genius and education qualify him to take part in any
speculation of the kind. and therefore yesterday when i saw that you
wanted me to describe the formation of the state, i readily assented,
being very well aware, that, if you only would, none were better
qualified to carry the discussion further, and that when you had engaged
our city in a suitable war, you of all men living could best exhibit
her playing a fitting part. when i had completed my task, i in return
imposed this other task upon you. you conferred together and agreed
to entertain me to-day, as i had entertained you, with a feast of
discourse. here am i in festive array, and no man can be more ready for
the promised banquet.

hermocrates: and we too, socrates, as timaeus says, will not be wanting
in enthusiasm; and there is no excuse for not complying with your
request. as soon as we arrived yesterday at the guest-chamber of
critias, with whom we are staying, or rather on our way thither, we
talked the matter over, and he told us an ancient tradition, which i
wish, critias, that you would repeat to socrates, so that he may help us
to judge whether it will satisfy his requirements or not.

critias: i will, if timaeus, who is our other partner, approves.

timaeus: i quite approve.

critias: then listen, socrates, to a tale which, though strange, is
certainly true, having been attested by solon, who was the wisest of
the seven sages. he was a relative and a dear friend of my
great-grandfather, dropides, as he himself says in many passages of his
poems; and he told the story to critias, my grandfather, who remembered
and repeated it to us. there were of old, he said, great and marvellous
actions of the athenian city, which have passed into oblivion through
lapse of time and the destruction of mankind, and one in particular,
greater than all the rest. this we will now rehearse. it will be a
fitting monument of our gratitude to you, and a hymn of praise true and
worthy of the goddess, on this her day of festival.

socrates: very good. and what is this ancient famous action of the
athenians, which critias declared, on the authority of solon, to be not
a mere legend, but an actual fact?

critias: i will tell an old-world story which i heard from an aged man;
for critias, at the time of telling it, was, as he said, nearly ninety
years of age, and i was about ten. now the day was that day of the
apaturia which is called the registration of youth, at which, according
to custom, our parents gave prizes for recitations, and the poems of
several poets were recited by us boys, and many of us sang the poems of
solon, which at that time had not gone out of fashion. one of our tribe,
either because he thought so or to please critias, said that in his
judgment solon was not only the wisest of men, but also the noblest of
poets. the old man, as i very well remember, brightened up at hearing
this and said, smiling: yes, amynander, if solon had only, like other
poets, made poetry the business of his life, and had completed the tale
which he brought with him from egypt, and had not been compelled, by
reason of the factions and troubles which he found stirring in his own
country when he came home, to attend to other matters, in my opinion he
would have been as famous as homer or hesiod, or any poet.

and what was the tale about, critias? said amynander.

about the greatest action which the athenians ever did, and which ought
to have been the most famous, but, through the lapse of time and the
destruction of the actors, it has not come down to us.

tell us, said the other, the whole story, and how and from whom solon
heard this veritable tradition.

he replied:--in the egyptian delta, at the head of which the river nile
divides, there is a certain district which is called the district of
sais, and the great city of the district is also called sais, and is the
city from which king amasis came. the citizens have a deity for their
foundress; she is called in the egyptian tongue neith, and is asserted
by them to be the same whom the hellenes call athene; they are great
lovers of the athenians, and say that they are in some way related to
them. to this city came solon, and was received there with great honour;
he asked the priests who were most skilful in such matters, about
antiquity, and made the discovery that neither he nor any other hellene
knew anything worth mentioning about the times of old. on one occasion,
wishing to draw them on to speak of antiquity, he began to tell about
the most ancient things in our part of the world--about phoroneus, who
is called 'the first man,' and about niobe; and after the deluge, of the
survival of deucalion and pyrrha; and he traced the genealogy of their
descendants, and reckoning up the dates, tried to compute how many years
ago the events of which he was speaking happened. thereupon one of the
priests, who was of a very great age, said: o solon, solon, you hellenes
are never anything but children, and there is not an old man among you.
solon in return asked him what he meant. i mean to say, he replied, that
in mind you are all young; there is no old opinion handed down among
you by ancient tradition, nor any science which is hoary with age. and i
will tell you why. there have been, and will be again, many destructions
of mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have been brought
about by the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones by
innumerable other causes. there is a story, which even you have
preserved, that once upon a time paethon, the son of helios, having
yoked the steeds in his father's chariot, because he was not able to
drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the
earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt. now this has the form
of a myth, but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving in
the heavens around the earth, and a great conflagration of things upon
the earth, which recurs after long intervals; at such times those who
live upon the mountains and in dry and lofty places are more liable to
destruction than those who dwell by rivers or on the seashore. and from
this calamity the nile, who is our never-failing saviour, delivers and
preserves us. when, on the other hand, the gods purge the earth with
a deluge of water, the survivors in your country are herdsmen and
shepherds who dwell on the mountains, but those who, like you, live in
cities are carried by the rivers into the sea. whereas in this land,
neither then nor at any other time, does the water come down from above
on the fields, having always a tendency to come up from below; for which
reason the traditions preserved here are the most ancient. the fact is,
that wherever the extremity of winter frost or of summer sun does
not prevent, mankind exist, sometimes in greater, sometimes in lesser
numbers. and whatever happened either in your country or in ours, or
in any other region of which we are informed--if there were any actions
noble or great or in any other way remarkable, they have all been
written down by us of old, and are preserved in our temples. whereas
just when you and other nations are beginning to be provided with
letters and the other requisites of civilized life, after the usual
interval, the stream from heaven, like a pestilence, comes pouring down,
and leaves only those of you who are destitute of letters and education;
and so you have to begin all over again like children, and know nothing
of what happened in ancient times, either among us or among yourselves.
as for those genealogies of yours which you just now recounted to us,
solon, they are no better than the tales of children. in the first place
you remember a single deluge only, but there were many previous ones; in
the next place, you do not know that there formerly dwelt in your land
the fairest and noblest race of men which ever lived, and that you and
your whole city are descended from a small seed or remnant of them which
survived. and this was unknown to you, because, for many generations,
the survivors of that destruction died, leaving no written word. for
there was a time, solon, before the great deluge of all, when the city
which now is athens was first in war and in every way the best governed
of all cities, is said to have performed the noblest deeds and to have
had the fairest constitution of any of which tradition tells, under the
face of heaven. solon marvelled at his words, and earnestly requested
the priests to inform him exactly and in order about these former
citizens. you are welcome to hear about them, solon, said the priest,
both for your own sake and for that of your city, and above all, for the
sake of the goddess who is the common patron and parent and educator
of both our cities. she founded your city a thousand years before
ours (observe that plato gives the same date (9000 years ago) for the
foundation of athens and for the repulse of the invasion from atlantis
(crit.).), receiving from the earth and hephaestus the seed of your
race, and afterwards she founded ours, of which the constitution is
recorded in our sacred registers to be 8000 years old. as touching your
citizens of 9000 years ago, i will briefly inform you of their laws and
of their most famous action; the exact particulars of the whole we will
hereafter go through at our leisure in the sacred registers themselves.
if you compare these very laws with ours you will find that many of
ours are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time. in the
first place, there is the caste of priests, which is separated from all
the others; next, there are the artificers, who ply their several
crafts by themselves and do not intermix; and also there is the class
of shepherds and of hunters, as well as that of husbandmen; and you will
observe, too, that the warriors in egypt are distinct from all the other
classes, and are commanded by the law to devote themselves solely to
military pursuits; moreover, the weapons which they carry are shields
and spears, a style of equipment which the goddess taught of asiatics
first to us, as in your part of the world first to you. then as to
wisdom, do you observe how our law from the very first made a study of
the whole order of things, extending even to prophecy and medicine which
gives health, out of these divine elements deriving what was needful for
human life, and adding every sort of knowledge which was akin to them.
all this order and arrangement the goddess first imparted to you when
establishing your city; and she chose the spot of earth in which you
were born, because she saw that the happy temperament of the seasons in
that land would produce the wisest of men. wherefore the goddess, who
was a lover both of war and of wisdom, selected and first of all settled
that spot which was the most likely to produce men likest herself. and
there you dwelt, having such laws as these and still better ones, and
excelled all mankind in all virtue, as became the children and disciples
of the gods.

many great and wonderful deeds are recorded of your state in our
histories. but one of them exceeds all the rest in greatness and valour.
for these histories tell of a mighty power which unprovoked made an
expedition against the whole of europe and asia, and to which your city
put an end. this power came forth out of the atlantic ocean, for in
those days the atlantic was navigable; and there was an island situated
in front of the straits which are by you called the pillars of heracles;
the island was larger than libya and asia put together, and was the
way to other islands, and from these you might pass to the whole of the
opposite continent which surrounded the true ocean; for this sea which
is within the straits of heracles is only a harbour, having a narrow
entrance, but that other is a real sea, and the surrounding land may be
most truly called a boundless continent. now in this island of atlantis
there was a great and wonderful empire which had rule over the whole
island and several others, and over parts of the continent, and,
furthermore, the men of atlantis had subjected the parts of libya
within the columns of heracles as far as egypt, and of europe as far as
tyrrhenia. this vast power, gathered into one, endeavoured to subdue
at a blow our country and yours and the whole of the region within the
straits; and then, solon, your country shone forth, in the excellence
of her virtue and strength, among all mankind. she was pre-eminent in
courage and military skill, and was the leader of the hellenes. and when
the rest fell off from her, being compelled to stand alone, after having
undergone the very extremity of danger, she defeated and triumphed
over the invaders, and preserved from slavery those who were not yet
subjugated, and generously liberated all the rest of us who dwell within
the pillars. but afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and
floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men
in a body sank into the earth, and the island of atlantis in like manner
disappeared in the depths of the sea. for which reason the sea in those
parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is a shoal of mud in
the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of the island.

i have told you briefly, socrates, what the aged critias heard from
solon and related to us. and when you were speaking yesterday about your
city and citizens, the tale which i have just been repeating to you came
into my mind, and i remarked with astonishment how, by some mysterious
coincidence, you agreed in almost every particular with the narrative
of solon; but i did not like to speak at the moment. for a long time had
elapsed, and i had forgotten too much; i thought that i must first of
all run over the narrative in my own mind, and then i would speak. and
so i readily assented to your request yesterday, considering that in
all such cases the chief difficulty is to find a tale suitable to our
purpose, and that with such a tale we should be fairly well provided.

and therefore, as hermocrates has told you, on my way home yesterday i
at once communicated the tale to my companions as i remembered it; and
after i left them, during the night by thinking i recovered nearly the
whole of it. truly, as is often said, the lessons of our childhood make
a wonderful impression on our memories; for i am not sure that i could
remember all the discourse of yesterday, but i should be much surprised
if i forgot any of these things which i have heard very long ago. i
listened at the time with childlike interest to the old man's narrative;
he was very ready to teach me, and i asked him again and again to repeat
his words, so that like an indelible picture they were branded into my
mind. as soon as the day broke, i rehearsed them as he spoke them to my
companions, that they, as well as myself, might have something to say.
and now, socrates, to make an end of my preface, i am ready to tell
you the whole tale. i will give you not only the general heads, but the
particulars, as they were told to me. the city and citizens, which you
yesterday described to us in fiction, we will now transfer to the world
of reality. it shall be the ancient city of athens, and we will suppose
that the citizens whom you imagined, were our veritable ancestors, of
whom the priest spoke; they will perfectly harmonize, and there will be
no inconsistency in saying that the citizens of your republic are these
ancient athenians. let us divide the subject among us, and all endeavour
according to our ability gracefully to execute the task which you have
imposed upon us. consider then, socrates, if this narrative is suited to
the purpose, or whether we should seek for some other instead.

socrates: and what other, critias, can we find that will be better than
this, which is natural and suitable to the festival of the goddess, and
has the very great advantage of being a fact and not a fiction? how or
where shall we find another if we abandon this? we cannot, and therefore
you must tell the tale, and good luck to you; and i in return for my
yesterday's discourse will now rest and be a listener.

critias: let me proceed to explain to you, socrates, the order in which
we have arranged our entertainment. our intention is, that timaeus, who
is the most of an astronomer amongst us, and has made the nature of
the universe his special study, should speak first, beginning with the
generation of the world and going down to the creation of man; next, i
am to receive the men whom he has created, and of whom some will have
profited by the excellent education which you have given them; and then,
in accordance with the tale of solon, and equally with his law, we will
bring them into court and make them citizens, as if they were those very
athenians whom the sacred egyptian record has recovered from
oblivion, and thenceforward we will speak of them as athenians and
fellow-citizens.

socrates: i see that i shall receive in my turn a perfect and splendid
feast of reason. and now, timaeus, you, i suppose, should speak next,
after duly calling upon the gods.

timaeus: all men, socrates, who have any degree of right feeling, at the
beginning of every enterprise, whether small or great, always call
upon god. and we, too, who are going to discourse of the nature of the
universe, how created or how existing without creation, if we be not
altogether out of our wits, must invoke the aid of gods and goddesses
and pray that our words may be acceptable to them and consistent with
themselves. let this, then, be our invocation of the gods, to which i
add an exhortation of myself to speak in such manner as will be most
intelligible to you, and will most accord with my own intent.

first then, in my judgment, we must make a distinction and ask, what
is that which always is and has no becoming; and what is that which is
always becoming and never is? that which is apprehended by intelligence
and reason is always in the same state; but that which is conceived by
opinion with the help of sensation and without reason, is always in a
process of becoming and perishing and never really is. now everything
that becomes or is created must of necessity be created by some cause,
for without a cause nothing can be created. the work of the creator,
whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature
of his work after an unchangeable pattern, must necessarily be made fair
and perfect; but when he looks to the created only, and uses a created
pattern, it is not fair or perfect. was the heaven then or the world,
whether called by this or by any other more appropriate name--assuming
the name, i am asking a question which has to be asked at the beginning
of an enquiry about anything--was the world, i say, always in existence
and without beginning? or created, and had it a beginning? created,
i reply, being visible and tangible and having a body, and therefore
sensible; and all sensible things are apprehended by opinion and sense
and are in a process of creation and created. now that which is created
must, as we affirm, of necessity be created by a cause. but the father
and maker of all this universe is past finding out; and even if we found
him, to tell of him to all men would be impossible. and there is still a
question to be asked about him: which of the patterns had the artificer
in view when he made the world--the pattern of the unchangeable, or of
that which is created? if the world be indeed fair and the artificer
good, it is manifest that he must have looked to that which is eternal;
but if what cannot be said without blasphemy is true, then to the
created pattern. every one will see that he must have looked to the
eternal; for the world is the fairest of creations and he is the best of
causes. and having been created in this way, the world has been framed
in the likeness of that which is apprehended by reason and mind and is
unchangeable, and must therefore of necessity, if this is admitted, be
a copy of something. now it is all-important that the beginning of
everything should be according to nature. and in speaking of the copy
and the original we may assume that words are akin to the matter
which they describe; when they relate to the lasting and permanent and
intelligible, they ought to be lasting and unalterable, and, as far as
their nature allows, irrefutable and immovable--nothing less. but
when they express only the copy or likeness and not the eternal things
themselves, they need only be likely and analogous to the real words. as
being is to becoming, so is truth to belief. if then, socrates, amid the
many opinions about the gods and the generation of the universe, we are
not able to give notions which are altogether and in every respect exact
and consistent with one another, do not be surprised. enough, if we
adduce probabilities as likely as any others; for we must remember that
i who am the speaker, and you who are the judges, are only mortal
men, and we ought to accept the tale which is probable and enquire no
further.

socrates: excellent, timaeus; and we will do precisely as you bid us.
the prelude is charming, and is already accepted by us--may we beg of
you to proceed to the strain?

timaeus: let me tell you then why the creator made this world of
generation. he was good, and the good can never have any jealousy of
anything. and being free from jealousy, he desired that all things
should be as like himself as they could be. this is in the truest
sense the origin of creation and of the world, as we shall do well in
believing on the testimony of wise men: god desired that all things
should be good and nothing bad, so far as this was attainable. wherefore
also finding the whole visible sphere not at rest, but moving in an
irregular and disorderly fashion, out of disorder he brought order,
considering that this was in every way better than the other. now the
deeds of the best could never be or have been other than the fairest;
and the creator, reflecting on the things which are by nature visible,
found that no unintelligent creature taken as a whole was fairer than
the intelligent taken as a whole; and that intelligence could not be
present in anything which was devoid of soul. for which reason, when he
was framing the universe, he put intelligence in soul, and soul in body,
that he might be the creator of a work which was by nature fairest and
best. wherefore, using the language of probability, we may say that the
world became a living creature truly endowed with soul and intelligence
by the providence of god.

this being supposed, let us proceed to the next stage: in the likeness
of what animal did the creator make the world? it would be an unworthy
thing to liken it to any nature which exists as a part only; for nothing
can be beautiful which is like any imperfect thing; but let us suppose
the world to be the very image of that whole of which all other animals
both individually and in their tribes are portions. for the original of
the universe contains in itself all intelligible beings, just as this
world comprehends us and all other visible creatures. for the deity,
intending to make this world like the fairest and most perfect of
intelligible beings, framed one visible animal comprehending within
itself all other animals of a kindred nature. are we right in saying
that there is one world, or that they are many and infinite? there must
be one only, if the created copy is to accord with the original. for
that which includes all other intelligible creatures cannot have a
second or companion; in that case there would be need of another living
being which would include both, and of which they would be parts, and
the likeness would be more truly said to resemble not them, but that
other which included them. in order then that the world might be
solitary, like the perfect animal, the creator made not two worlds or an
infinite number of them; but there is and ever will be one only-begotten
and created heaven.

now that which is created is of necessity corporeal, and also visible
and tangible. and nothing is visible where there is no fire, or tangible
which has no solidity, and nothing is solid without earth. wherefore
also god in the beginning of creation made the body of the universe to
consist of fire and earth. but two things cannot be rightly put together
without a third; there must be some bond of union between them. and the
fairest bond is that which makes the most complete fusion of itself and
the things which it combines; and proportion is best adapted to effect
such a union. for whenever in any three numbers, whether cube or square,
there is a mean, which is to the last term what the first term is to it;
and again, when the mean is to the first term as the last term is to the
mean--then the mean becoming first and last, and the first and last both
becoming means, they will all of them of necessity come to be the same,
and having become the same with one another will be all one. if the
universal frame had been created a surface only and having no depth, a
single mean would have sufficed to bind together itself and the other
terms; but now, as the world must be solid, and solid bodies are always
compacted not by one mean but by two, god placed water and air in the
mean between fire and earth, and made them to have the same proportion
so far as was possible (as fire is to air so is air to water, and as air
is to water so is water to earth); and thus he bound and put together
a visible and tangible heaven. and for these reasons, and out of such
elements which are in number four, the body of the world was created,
and it was harmonized by proportion, and therefore has the spirit of
friendship; and having been reconciled to itself, it was indissoluble by
the hand of any other than the framer.

now the creation took up the whole of each of the four elements; for the
creator compounded the world out of all the fire and all the water and
all the air and all the earth, leaving no part of any of them nor any
power of them outside. his intention was, in the first place, that
the animal should be as far as possible a perfect whole and of perfect
parts: secondly, that it should be one, leaving no remnants out of which
another such world might be created: and also that it should be free
from old age and unaffected by disease. considering that if heat and
cold and other powerful forces which unite bodies surround and attack
them from without when they are unprepared, they decompose them, and by
bringing diseases and old age upon them, make them waste away--for this
cause and on these grounds he made the world one whole, having every
part entire, and being therefore perfect and not liable to old age and
disease. and he gave to the world the figure which was suitable and also
natural. now to the animal which was to comprehend all animals, that
figure was suitable which comprehends within itself all other figures.
wherefore he made the world in the form of a globe, round as from a
lathe, having its extremes in every direction equidistant from the
centre, the most perfect and the most like itself of all figures; for he
considered that the like is infinitely fairer than the unlike. this he
finished off, making the surface smooth all round for many reasons; in
the first place, because the living being had no need of eyes when there
was nothing remaining outside him to be seen; nor of ears when there
was nothing to be heard; and there was no surrounding atmosphere to be
breathed; nor would there have been any use of organs by the help
of which he might receive his food or get rid of what he had already
digested, since there was nothing which went from him or came into him:
for there was nothing beside him. of design he was created thus, his
own waste providing his own food, and all that he did or suffered taking
place in and by himself. for the creator conceived that a being which
was self-sufficient would be far more excellent than one which lacked
anything; and, as he had no need to take anything or defend himself
against any one, the creator did not think it necessary to bestow upon
him hands: nor had he any need of feet, nor of the whole apparatus of
walking; but the movement suited to his spherical form was assigned to
him, being of all the seven that which is most appropriate to mind and
intelligence; and he was made to move in the same manner and on the same
spot, within his own limits revolving in a circle. all the other six
motions were taken away from him, and he was made not to partake of
their deviations. and as this circular movement required no feet, the
universe was created without legs and without feet.

such was the whole plan of the eternal god about the god that was to
be, to whom for this reason he gave a body, smooth and even, having a
surface in every direction equidistant from the centre, a body entire
and perfect, and formed out of perfect bodies. and in the centre he put
the soul, which he diffused throughout the body, making it also to be
the exterior environment of it; and he made the universe a circle moving
in a circle, one and solitary, yet by reason of its excellence able to
converse with itself, and needing no other friendship or acquaintance.
having these purposes in view he created the world a blessed god.

now god did not make the soul after the body, although we are speaking
of them in this order; for having brought them together he would never
have allowed that the elder should be ruled by the younger; but this is
a random manner of speaking which we have, because somehow we ourselves
too are very much under the dominion of chance. whereas he made the soul
in origin and excellence prior to and older than the body, to be the
ruler and mistress, of whom the body was to be the subject. and he
made her out of the following elements and on this wise: out of the
indivisible and unchangeable, and also out of that which is divisible
and has to do with material bodies, he compounded a third and
intermediate kind of essence, partaking of the nature of the same and of
the other, and this compound he placed accordingly in a mean between the
indivisible, and the divisible and material. he took the three elements
of the same, the other, and the essence, and mingled them into one form,
compressing by force the reluctant and unsociable nature of the other
into the same. when he had mingled them with the essence and out of
three made one, he again divided this whole into as many portions as was
fitting, each portion being a compound of the same, the other, and the
essence. and he proceeded to divide after this manner:--first of all, he
took away one part of the whole (1), and then he separated a second part
which was double the first (2), and then he took away a third part which
was half as much again as the second and three times as much as the
first (3), and then he took a fourth part which was twice as much as the
second (4), and a fifth part which was three times the third (9), and a
sixth part which was eight times the first (8), and a seventh part
which was twenty-seven times the first (27). after this he filled up the
double intervals (i.e. between 1, 2, 4, 8) and the triple (i.e. between
1, 3, 9, 27) cutting off yet other portions from the mixture and placing
them in the intervals, so that in each interval there were two kinds of
means, the one exceeding and exceeded by equal parts of its extremes (as
for example 1, 4/3, 2, in which the mean 4/3 is one-third of 1 more than
1, and one-third of 2 less than 2), the other being that kind of mean
which exceeds and is exceeded by an equal number (e.g.

  - over 1, 4/3, 3/2, - over 2, 8/3, 3, - over 4, 16/3, 6,  - over 8: and
  - over 1, 3/2, 2,   - over 3, 9/2, 6, - over 9, 27/2, 18, - over 27.

where there were intervals of 3/2 and of 4/3 and of 9/8, made by the
connecting terms in the former intervals, he filled up all the intervals
of 4/3 with the interval of 9/8, leaving a fraction over; and the
interval which this fraction expressed was in the ratio of 256 to 243
(e.g.


 243:256::81/64:4/3::243/128:2::81/32:8/3::243/64:4::81/16:16/3::242/32:8.


and thus the whole mixture out of which he cut these portions was all
exhausted by him. this entire compound he divided lengthways into two
parts, which he joined to one another at the centre like the letter x,
and bent them into a circular form, connecting them with themselves and
each other at the point opposite to their original meeting-point; and,
comprehending them in a uniform revolution upon the same axis, he made
the one the outer and the other the inner circle. now the motion of the
outer circle he called the motion of the same, and the motion of the
inner circle the motion of the other or diverse. the motion of the same
he carried round by the side (i.e. of the rectangular figure supposed to
be inscribed in the circle of the same) to the right, and the motion of
the diverse diagonally (i.e. across the rectangular figure from corner
to corner) to the left. and he gave dominion to the motion of the same
and like, for that he left single and undivided; but the inner motion
he divided in six places and made seven unequal circles having their
intervals in ratios of two and three, three of each, and bade the orbits
proceed in a direction opposite to one another; and three (sun, mercury,
venus) he made to move with equal swiftness, and the remaining four
(moon, saturn, mars, jupiter) to move with unequal swiftness to the
three and to one another, but in due proportion.

now when the creator had framed the soul according to his will, he
formed within her the corporeal universe, and brought the two together,
and united them centre to centre. the soul, interfused everywhere from
the centre to the circumference of heaven, of which also she is the
external envelopment, herself turning in herself, began a divine
beginning of never-ceasing and rational life enduring throughout all
time. the body of heaven is visible, but the soul is invisible,
and partakes of reason and harmony, and being made by the best of
intellectual and everlasting natures, is the best of things created. and
because she is composed of the same and of the other and of the essence,
these three, and is divided and united in due proportion, and in her
revolutions returns upon herself, the soul, when touching anything which
has essence, whether dispersed in parts or undivided, is stirred through
all her powers, to declare the sameness or difference of that thing and
some other; and to what individuals are related, and by what affected,
and in what way and how and when, both in the world of generation and
in the world of immutable being. and when reason, which works with equal
truth, whether she be in the circle of the diverse or of the same--in
voiceless silence holding her onward course in the sphere of the
self-moved--when reason, i say, is hovering around the sensible world
and when the circle of the diverse also moving truly imparts the
intimations of sense to the whole soul, then arise opinions and beliefs
sure and certain. but when reason is concerned with the rational, and
the circle of the same moving smoothly declares it, then intelligence
and knowledge are necessarily perfected. and if any one affirms that
in which these two are found to be other than the soul, he will say the
very opposite of the truth.

when the father and creator saw the creature which he had made moving
and living, the created image of the eternal gods, he rejoiced, and in
his joy determined to make the copy still more like the original; and
as this was eternal, he sought to make the universe eternal, so far
as might be. now the nature of the ideal being was everlasting, but to
bestow this attribute in its fulness upon a creature was impossible.
wherefore he resolved to have a moving image of eternity, and when he
set in order the heaven, he made this image eternal but moving according
to number, while eternity itself rests in unity; and this image we call
time. for there were no days and nights and months and years before the
heaven was created, but when he constructed the heaven he created them
also. they are all parts of time, and the past and future are created
species of time, which we unconsciously but wrongly transfer to the
eternal essence; for we say that he 'was,' he 'is,' he 'will be,' but
the truth is that 'is' alone is properly attributed to him, and that
'was' and 'will be' are only to be spoken of becoming in time, for they
are motions, but that which is immovably the same cannot become older or
younger by time, nor ever did or has become, or hereafter will be, older
or younger, nor is subject at all to any of those states which affect
moving and sensible things and of which generation is the cause. these
are the forms of time, which imitates eternity and revolves according
to a law of number. moreover, when we say that what has become is become
and what becomes is becoming, and that what will become is about
to become and that the non-existent is non-existent--all these are
inaccurate modes of expression (compare parmen.). but perhaps this whole
subject will be more suitably discussed on some other occasion.

time, then, and the heaven came into being at the same instant in
order that, having been created together, if ever there was to be a
dissolution of them, they might be dissolved together. it was framed
after the pattern of the eternal nature, that it might resemble this
as far as was possible; for the pattern exists from eternity, and the
created heaven has been, and is, and will be, in all time. such was the
mind and thought of god in the creation of time. the sun and moon and
five other stars, which are called the planets, were created by him in
order to distinguish and preserve the numbers of time; and when he had
made their several bodies, he placed them in the orbits in which the
circle of the other was revolving,--in seven orbits seven stars. first,
there was the moon in the orbit nearest the earth, and next the sun,
in the second orbit above the earth; then came the morning star and the
star sacred to hermes, moving in orbits which have an equal swiftness
with the sun, but in an opposite direction; and this is the reason why
the sun and hermes and lucifer overtake and are overtaken by each other.
to enumerate the places which he assigned to the other stars, and to
give all the reasons why he assigned them, although a secondary matter,
would give more trouble than the primary. these things at some future
time, when we are at leisure, may have the consideration which they
deserve, but not at present.

now, when all the stars which were necessary to the creation of time
had attained a motion suitable to them, and had become living creatures
having bodies fastened by vital chains, and learnt their appointed
task, moving in the motion of the diverse, which is diagonal, and passes
through and is governed by the motion of the same, they revolved, some
in a larger and some in a lesser orbit--those which had the lesser orbit
revolving faster, and those which had the larger more slowly. now by
reason of the motion of the same, those which revolved fastest appeared
to be overtaken by those which moved slower although they really
overtook them; for the motion of the same made them all turn in a
spiral, and, because some went one way and some another, that which
receded most slowly from the sphere of the same, which was the swiftest,
appeared to follow it most nearly. that there might be some visible
measure of their relative swiftness and slowness as they proceeded in
their eight courses, god lighted a fire, which we now call the sun, in
the second from the earth of these orbits, that it might give light to
the whole of heaven, and that the animals, as many as nature intended,
might participate in number, learning arithmetic from the revolution of
the same and the like. thus then, and for this reason the night and
the day were created, being the period of the one most intelligent
revolution. and the month is accomplished when the moon has completed
her orbit and overtaken the sun, and the year when the sun has completed
his own orbit. mankind, with hardly an exception, have not remarked the
periods of the other stars, and they have no name for them, and do not
measure them against one another by the help of number, and hence they
can scarcely be said to know that their wanderings, being infinite in
number and admirable for their variety, make up time. and yet there
is no difficulty in seeing that the perfect number of time fulfils
the perfect year when all the eight revolutions, having their relative
degrees of swiftness, are accomplished together and attain their
completion at the same time, measured by the rotation of the same and
equally moving. after this manner, and for these reasons, came into
being such of the stars as in their heavenly progress received reversals
of motion, to the end that the created heaven might imitate the eternal
nature, and be as like as possible to the perfect and intelligible
animal.

thus far and until the birth of time the created universe was made in
the likeness of the original, but inasmuch as all animals were not yet
comprehended therein, it was still unlike. what remained, the creator
then proceeded to fashion after the nature of the pattern. now as in the
ideal animal the mind perceives ideas or species of a certain nature and
number, he thought that this created animal ought to have species of a
like nature and number. there are four such; one of them is the heavenly
race of the gods; another, the race of birds whose way is in the air;
the third, the watery species; and the fourth, the pedestrian and land
creatures. of the heavenly and divine, he created the greater part out
of fire, that they might be the brightest of all things and fairest to
behold, and he fashioned them after the likeness of the universe in the
figure of a circle, and made them follow the intelligent motion of the
supreme, distributing them over the whole circumference of heaven, which
was to be a true cosmos or glorious world spangled with them all over.
and he gave to each of them two movements: the first, a movement on the
same spot after the same manner, whereby they ever continue to think
consistently the same thoughts about the same things; the second, a
forward movement, in which they are controlled by the revolution of the
same and the like; but by the other five motions they were unaffected,
in order that each of them might attain the highest perfection. and
for this reason the fixed stars were created, to be divine and eternal
animals, ever-abiding and revolving after the same manner and on the
same spot; and the other stars which reverse their motion and are
subject to deviations of this kind, were created in the manner already
described. the earth, which is our nurse, clinging (or 'circling')
around the pole which is extended through the universe, he framed to be
the guardian and artificer of night and day, first and eldest of gods
that are in the interior of heaven. vain would be the attempt to tell
all the figures of them circling as in dance, and their juxtapositions,
and the return of them in their revolutions upon themselves, and their
approximations, and to say which of these deities in their conjunctions
meet, and which of them are in opposition, and in what order they get
behind and before one another, and when they are severally eclipsed to
our sight and again reappear, sending terrors and intimations of the
future to those who cannot calculate their movements--to attempt to
tell of all this without a visible representation of the heavenly system
would be labour in vain. enough on this head; and now let what we have
said about the nature of the created and visible gods have an end.

to know or tell the origin of the other divinities is beyond us, and we
must accept the traditions of the men of old time who affirm themselves
to be the offspring of the gods--that is what they say--and they must
surely have known their own ancestors. how can we doubt the word of the
children of the gods? although they give no probable or certain proofs,
still, as they declare that they are speaking of what took place in
their own family, we must conform to custom and believe them. in this
manner, then, according to them, the genealogy of these gods is to be
received and set forth.

oceanus and tethys were the children of earth and heaven, and from these
sprang phorcys and cronos and rhea, and all that generation; and from
cronos and rhea sprang zeus and here, and all those who are said to be
their brethren, and others who were the children of these.

now, when all of them, both those who visibly appear in their
revolutions as well as those other gods who are of a more retiring
nature, had come into being, the creator of the universe addressed them
in these words: 'gods, children of gods, who are my works, and of whom
i am the artificer and father, my creations are indissoluble, if so i
will. all that is bound may be undone, but only an evil being would wish
to undo that which is harmonious and happy. wherefore, since ye are but
creatures, ye are not altogether immortal and indissoluble, but ye shall
certainly not be dissolved, nor be liable to the fate of death, having
in my will a greater and mightier bond than those with which ye
were bound at the time of your birth. and now listen to my
instructions:--three tribes of mortal beings remain to be
created--without them the universe will be incomplete, for it will not
contain every kind of animal which it ought to contain, if it is to be
perfect. on the other hand, if they were created by me and received life
at my hands, they would be on an equality with the gods. in order then
that they may be mortal, and that this universe may be truly universal,
do ye, according to your natures, betake yourselves to the formation of
animals, imitating the power which was shown by me in creating you. the
part of them worthy of the name immortal, which is called divine and
is the guiding principle of those who are willing to follow justice and
you--of that divine part i will myself sow the seed, and having made a
beginning, i will hand the work over to you. and do ye then interweave
the mortal with the immortal, and make and beget living creatures, and
give them food, and make them to grow, and receive them again in death.'

thus he spake, and once more into the cup in which he had previously
mingled the soul of the universe he poured the remains of the elements,
and mingled them in much the same manner; they were not, however, pure
as before, but diluted to the second and third degree. and having made
it he divided the whole mixture into souls equal in number to the stars,
and assigned each soul to a star; and having there placed them as in a
chariot, he showed them the nature of the universe, and declared to them
the laws of destiny, according to which their first birth would be one
and the same for all,--no one should suffer a disadvantage at his hands;
they were to be sown in the instruments of time severally adapted to
them, and to come forth the most religious of animals; and as human
nature was of two kinds, the superior race would hereafter be called
man. now, when they should be implanted in bodies by necessity, and be
always gaining or losing some part of their bodily substance, then in
the first place it would be necessary that they should all have in
them one and the same faculty of sensation, arising out of irresistible
impressions; in the second place, they must have love, in which pleasure
and pain mingle; also fear and anger, and the feelings which are akin or
opposite to them; if they conquered these they would live righteously,
and if they were conquered by them, unrighteously. he who lived well
during his appointed time was to return and dwell in his native star,
and there he would have a blessed and congenial existence. but if he
failed in attaining this, at the second birth he would pass into a
woman, and if, when in that state of being, he did not desist from evil,
he would continually be changed into some brute who resembled him in the
evil nature which he had acquired, and would not cease from his toils
and transformations until he followed the revolution of the same and the
like within him, and overcame by the help of reason the turbulent and
irrational mob of later accretions, made up of fire and air and water
and earth, and returned to the form of his first and better state.
having given all these laws to his creatures, that he might be guiltless
of future evil in any of them, the creator sowed some of them in the
earth, and some in the moon, and some in the other instruments of
time; and when he had sown them he committed to the younger gods the
fashioning of their mortal bodies, and desired them to furnish what
was still lacking to the human soul, and having made all the suitable
additions, to rule over them, and to pilot the mortal animal in the
best and wisest manner which they could, and avert from him all but
self-inflicted evils.

when the creator had made all these ordinances he remained in his own
accustomed nature, and his children heard and were obedient to their
father's word, and receiving from him the immortal principle of a mortal
creature, in imitation of their own creator they borrowed portions of
fire, and earth, and water, and air from the world, which were hereafter
to be restored--these they took and welded them together, not with the
indissoluble chains by which they were themselves bound, but with little
pegs too small to be visible, making up out of all the four elements
each separate body, and fastening the courses of the immortal soul in
a body which was in a state of perpetual influx and efflux. now
these courses, detained as in a vast river, neither overcame nor were
overcome; but were hurrying and hurried to and fro, so that the whole
animal was moved and progressed, irregularly however and irrationally
and anyhow, in all the six directions of motion, wandering backwards
and forwards, and right and left, and up and down, and in all the six
directions. for great as was the advancing and retiring flood which
provided nourishment, the affections produced by external contact
caused still greater tumult--when the body of any one met and came
into collision with some external fire, or with the solid earth or the
gliding waters, or was caught in the tempest borne on the air, and the
motions produced by any of these impulses were carried through the body
to the soul. all such motions have consequently received the general
name of 'sensations,' which they still retain. and they did in fact
at that time create a very great and mighty movement; uniting with the
ever-flowing stream in stirring up and violently shaking the courses of
the soul, they completely stopped the revolution of the same by their
opposing current, and hindered it from predominating and advancing; and
they so disturbed the nature of the other or diverse, that the three
double intervals (i.e. between 1, 2, 4, 8), and the three triple
intervals (i.e. between 1, 3, 9, 27), together with the mean terms and
connecting links which are expressed by the ratios of 3:2, and 4:3, and
of 9:8--these, although they cannot be wholly undone except by him who
united them, were twisted by them in all sorts of ways, and the circles
were broken and disordered in every possible manner, so that when they
moved they were tumbling to pieces, and moved irrationally, at one time
in a reverse direction, and then again obliquely, and then upside
down, as you might imagine a person who is upside down and has his head
leaning upon the ground and his feet up against something in the air;
and when he is in such a position, both he and the spectator fancy that
the right of either is his left, and the left right. if, when powerfully
experiencing these and similar effects, the revolutions of the soul come
in contact with some external thing, either of the class of the same
or of the other, they speak of the same or of the other in a manner the
very opposite of the truth; and they become false and foolish, and there
is no course or revolution in them which has a guiding or directing
power; and if again any sensations enter in violently from without and
drag after them the whole vessel of the soul, then the courses of the
soul, though they seem to conquer, are really conquered.

and by reason of all these affections, the soul, when encased in a
mortal body, now, as in the beginning, is at first without intelligence;
but when the flood of growth and nutriment abates, and the courses of
the soul, calming down, go their own way and become steadier as time
goes on, then the several circles return to their natural form, and
their revolutions are corrected, and they call the same and the other by
their right names, and make the possessor of them to become a rational
being. and if these combine in him with any true nurture or education,
he attains the fulness and health of the perfect man, and escapes the
worst disease of all; but if he neglects education he walks lame to the
end of his life, and returns imperfect and good for nothing to the world
below. this, however, is a later stage; at present we must treat more
exactly the subject before us, which involves a preliminary enquiry into
the generation of the body and its members, and as to how the soul was
created--for what reason and by what providence of the gods; and holding
fast to probability, we must pursue our way.

first, then, the gods, imitating the spherical shape of the universe,
enclosed the two divine courses in a spherical body, that, namely, which
we now term the head, being the most divine part of us and the lord of
all that is in us: to this the gods, when they put together the body,
gave all the other members to be servants, considering that it partook
of every sort of motion. in order then that it might not tumble about
among the high and deep places of the earth, but might be able to get
over the one and out of the other, they provided the body to be its
vehicle and means of locomotion; which consequently had length and was
furnished with four limbs extended and flexible; these god contrived
to be instruments of locomotion with which it might take hold and find
support, and so be able to pass through all places, carrying on high the
dwelling-place of the most sacred and divine part of us. such was the
origin of legs and hands, which for this reason were attached to every
man; and the gods, deeming the front part of man to be more honourable
and more fit to command than the hinder part, made us to move mostly in
a forward direction. wherefore man must needs have his front part unlike
and distinguished from the rest of his body.

and so in the vessel of the head, they first of all put a face in which
they inserted organs to minister in all things to the providence of the
soul, and they appointed this part, which has authority, to be by nature
the part which is in front. and of the organs they first contrived
the eyes to give light, and the principle according to which they were
inserted was as follows: so much of fire as would not burn, but gave
a gentle light, they formed into a substance akin to the light of
every-day life; and the pure fire which is within us and related
thereto they made to flow through the eyes in a stream smooth and dense,
compressing the whole eye, and especially the centre part, so that it
kept out everything of a coarser nature, and allowed to pass only this
pure element. when the light of day surrounds the stream of vision,
then like falls upon like, and they coalesce, and one body is formed by
natural affinity in the line of vision, wherever the light that falls
from within meets with an external object. and the whole stream of
vision, being similarly affected in virtue of similarity, diffuses the
motions of what it touches or what touches it over the whole body, until
they reach the soul, causing that perception which we call sight. but
when night comes on and the external and kindred fire departs, then the
stream of vision is cut off; for going forth to an unlike element it
is changed and extinguished, being no longer of one nature with the
surrounding atmosphere which is now deprived of fire: and so the eye no
longer sees, and we feel disposed to sleep. for when the eyelids, which
the gods invented for the preservation of sight, are closed, they keep
in the internal fire; and the power of the fire diffuses and equalizes
the inward motions; when they are equalized, there is rest, and when the
rest is profound, sleep comes over us scarce disturbed by dreams;
but where the greater motions still remain, of whatever nature and in
whatever locality, they engender corresponding visions in dreams, which
are remembered by us when we are awake and in the external world. and
now there is no longer any difficulty in understanding the creation
of images in mirrors and all smooth and bright surfaces. for from the
communion of the internal and external fires, and again from the union
of them and their numerous transformations when they meet in the mirror,
all these appearances of necessity arise, when the fire from the face
coalesces with the fire from the eye on the bright and smooth surface.
and right appears left and left right, because the visual rays come into
contact with the rays emitted by the object in a manner contrary to the
usual mode of meeting; but the right appears right, and the left left,
when the position of one of the two concurring lights is reversed; and
this happens when the mirror is concave and its smooth surface repels
the right stream of vision to the left side, and the left to the right
(he is speaking of two kinds of mirrors, first the plane, secondly the
concave; and the latter is supposed to be placed, first horizontally,
and then vertically.). or if the mirror be turned vertically, then the
concavity makes the countenance appear to be all upside down, and the
lower rays are driven upwards and the upper downwards.

all these are to be reckoned among the second and co-operative causes
which god, carrying into execution the idea of the best as far as
possible, uses as his ministers. they are thought by most men not to be
the second, but the prime causes of all things, because they freeze and
heat, and contract and dilate, and the like. but they are not so, for
they are incapable of reason or intellect; the only being which can
properly have mind is the invisible soul, whereas fire and water, and
earth and air, are all of them visible bodies. the lover of intellect
and knowledge ought to explore causes of intelligent nature first of
all, and, secondly, of those things which, being moved by others, are
compelled to move others. and this is what we too must do. both kinds
of causes should be acknowledged by us, but a distinction should be made
between those which are endowed with mind and are the workers of things
fair and good, and those which are deprived of intelligence and always
produce chance effects without order or design. of the second or
co-operative causes of sight, which help to give to the eyes the power
which they now possess, enough has been said. i will therefore now
proceed to speak of the higher use and purpose for which god has given
them to us. the sight in my opinion is the source of the greatest
benefit to us, for had we never seen the stars, and the sun, and the
heaven, none of the words which we have spoken about the universe would
ever have been uttered. but now the sight of day and night, and the
months and the revolutions of the years, have created number, and have
given us a conception of time, and the power of enquiring about the
nature of the universe; and from this source we have derived philosophy,
than which no greater good ever was or will be given by the gods to
mortal man. this is the greatest boon of sight: and of the lesser
benefits why should i speak? even the ordinary man if he were deprived
of them would bewail his loss, but in vain. thus much let me say
however: god invented and gave us sight to the end that we might behold
the courses of intelligence in the heaven, and apply them to the courses
of our own intelligence which are akin to them, the unperturbed to the
perturbed; and that we, learning them and partaking of the natural truth
of reason, might imitate the absolutely unerring courses of god and
regulate our own vagaries. the same may be affirmed of speech and
hearing: they have been given by the gods to the same end and for a
like reason. for this is the principal end of speech, whereto it most
contributes. moreover, so much of music as is adapted to the sound of
the voice and to the sense of hearing is granted to us for the sake of
harmony; and harmony, which has motions akin to the revolutions of our
souls, is not regarded by the intelligent votary of the muses as given
by them with a view to irrational pleasure, which is deemed to be the
purpose of it in our day, but as meant to correct any discord which may
have arisen in the courses of the soul, and to be our ally in bringing
her into harmony and agreement with herself; and rhythm too was given by
them for the same reason, on account of the irregular and graceless ways
which prevail among mankind generally, and to help us against them.

thus far in what we have been saying, with small exception, the works of
intelligence have been set forth; and now we must place by the side
of them in our discourse the things which come into being through
necessity--for the creation is mixed, being made up of necessity and
mind. mind, the ruling power, persuaded necessity to bring the greater
part of created things to perfection, and thus and after this manner in
the beginning, when the influence of reason got the better of necessity,
the universe was created. but if a person will truly tell of the way in
which the work was accomplished, he must include the other influence
of the variable cause as well. wherefore, we must return again and find
another suitable beginning, as about the former matters, so also about
these. to which end we must consider the nature of fire, and water, and
air, and earth, such as they were prior to the creation of the heaven,
and what was happening to them in this previous state; for no one has as
yet explained the manner of their generation, but we speak of fire and
the rest of them, whatever they mean, as though men knew their natures,
and we maintain them to be the first principles and letters or elements
of the whole, when they cannot reasonably be compared by a man of any
sense even to syllables or first compounds. and let me say thus much: i
will not now speak of the first principle or principles of all things,
or by whatever name they are to be called, for this reason--because
it is difficult to set forth my opinion according to the method of
discussion which we are at present employing. do not imagine, any
more than i can bring myself to imagine, that i should be right in
undertaking so great and difficult a task. remembering what i said
at first about probability, i will do my best to give as probable an
explanation as any other--or rather, more probable; and i will first go
back to the beginning and try to speak of each thing and of all. once
more, then, at the commencement of my discourse, i call upon god, and
beg him to be our saviour out of a strange and unwonted enquiry, and to
bring us to the haven of probability. so now let us begin again.

this new beginning of our discussion of the universe requires a fuller
division than the former; for then we made two classes, now a third must
be revealed. the two sufficed for the former discussion: one, which we
assumed, was a pattern intelligible and always the same; and the second
was only the imitation of the pattern, generated and visible. there is
also a third kind which we did not distinguish at the time, conceiving
that the two would be enough. but now the argument seems to require
that we should set forth in words another kind, which is difficult of
explanation and dimly seen. what nature are we to attribute to this new
kind of being? we reply, that it is the receptacle, and in a manner the
nurse, of all generation. i have spoken the truth; but i must express
myself in clearer language, and this will be an arduous task for
many reasons, and in particular because i must first raise questions
concerning fire and the other elements, and determine what each of them
is; for to say, with any probability or certitude, which of them should
be called water rather than fire, and which should be called any of them
rather than all or some one of them, is a difficult matter. how, then,
shall we settle this point, and what questions about the elements may be
fairly raised?

in the first place, we see that what we just now called water, by
condensation, i suppose, becomes stone and earth; and this same element,
when melted and dispersed, passes into vapour and air. air, again, when
inflamed, becomes fire; and again fire, when condensed and extinguished,
passes once more into the form of air; and once more, air, when
collected and condensed, produces cloud and mist; and from these, when
still more compressed, comes flowing water, and from water comes earth
and stones once more; and thus generation appears to be transmitted from
one to the other in a circle. thus, then, as the several elements never
present themselves in the same form, how can any one have the assurance
to assert positively that any of them, whatever it may be, is one thing
rather than another? no one can. but much the safest plan is to speak of
them as follows:--anything which we see to be continually changing, as,
for example, fire, we must not call 'this' or 'that,' but rather say
that it is 'of such a nature'; nor let us speak of water as 'this'; but
always as 'such'; nor must we imply that there is any stability in any
of those things which we indicate by the use of the words 'this' and
'that,' supposing ourselves to signify something thereby; for they
are too volatile to be detained in any such expressions as 'this,'
or 'that,' or 'relative to this,' or any other mode of speaking which
represents them as permanent. we ought not to apply 'this' to any of
them, but rather the word 'such'; which expresses the similar principle
circulating in each and all of them; for example, that should be called
'fire' which is of such a nature always, and so of everything that has
generation. that in which the elements severally grow up, and appear,
and decay, is alone to be called by the name 'this' or 'that'; but that
which is of a certain nature, hot or white, or anything which admits of
opposite qualities, and all things that are compounded of them, ought
not to be so denominated. let me make another attempt to explain my
meaning more clearly. suppose a person to make all kinds of figures of
gold and to be always transmuting one form into all the rest;--somebody
points to one of them and asks what it is. by far the safest and truest
answer is, that is gold; and not to call the triangle or any other
figures which are formed in the gold 'these,' as though they had
existence, since they are in process of change while he is making
the assertion; but if the questioner be willing to take the safe and
indefinite expression, 'such,' we should be satisfied. and the same
argument applies to the universal nature which receives all bodies--that
must be always called the same; for, while receiving all things, she
never departs at all from her own nature, and never in any way, or at
any time, assumes a form like that of any of the things which enter into
her; she is the natural recipient of all impressions, and is stirred and
informed by them, and appears different from time to time by reason
of them. but the forms which enter into and go out of her are the
likenesses of real existences modelled after their patterns in a
wonderful and inexplicable manner, which we will hereafter investigate.
for the present we have only to conceive of three natures: first,
that which is in process of generation; secondly, that in which the
generation takes place; and thirdly, that of which the thing generated
is a resemblance. and we may liken the receiving principle to a mother,
and the source or spring to a father, and the intermediate nature to
a child; and may remark further, that if the model is to take every
variety of form, then the matter in which the model is fashioned will
not be duly prepared, unless it is formless, and free from the impress
of any of those shapes which it is hereafter to receive from without.
for if the matter were like any of the supervening forms, then whenever
any opposite or entirely different nature was stamped upon its surface,
it would take the impression badly, because it would intrude its own
shape. wherefore, that which is to receive all forms should have
no form; as in making perfumes they first contrive that the liquid
substance which is to receive the scent shall be as inodorous as
possible; or as those who wish to impress figures on soft substances
do not allow any previous impression to remain, but begin by making the
surface as even and smooth as possible. in the same way that which is to
receive perpetually and through its whole extent the resemblances of all
eternal beings ought to be devoid of any particular form. wherefore, the
mother and receptacle of all created and visible and in any way sensible
things, is not to be termed earth, or air, or fire, or water, or any of
their compounds or any of the elements from which these are derived, but
is an invisible and formless being which receives all things and in
some mysterious way partakes of the intelligible, and is most
incomprehensible. in saying this we shall not be far wrong; as far,
however, as we can attain to a knowledge of her from the previous
considerations, we may truly say that fire is that part of her nature
which from time to time is inflamed, and water that which is moistened,
and that the mother substance becomes earth and air, in so far as she
receives the impressions of them.

let us consider this question more precisely. is there any self-existent
fire? and do all those things which we call self-existent exist? or
are only those things which we see, or in some way perceive through the
bodily organs, truly existent, and nothing whatever besides them? and is
all that which we call an intelligible essence nothing at all, and
only a name? here is a question which we must not leave unexamined or
undetermined, nor must we affirm too confidently that there can be no
decision; neither must we interpolate in our present long discourse
a digression equally long, but if it is possible to set forth a great
principle in a few words, that is just what we want.

thus i state my view:--if mind and true opinion are two distinct
classes, then i say that there certainly are these self-existent ideas
unperceived by sense, and apprehended only by the mind; if, however, as
some say, true opinion differs in no respect from mind, then everything
that we perceive through the body is to be regarded as most real
and certain. but we must affirm them to be distinct, for they have a
distinct origin and are of a different nature; the one is implanted
in us by instruction, the other by persuasion; the one is always
accompanied by true reason, the other is without reason; the one cannot
be overcome by persuasion, but the other can: and lastly, every man may
be said to share in true opinion, but mind is the attribute of the gods
and of very few men. wherefore also we must acknowledge that there
is one kind of being which is always the same, uncreated and
indestructible, never receiving anything into itself from without, nor
itself going out to any other, but invisible and imperceptible by any
sense, and of which the contemplation is granted to intelligence only.
and there is another nature of the same name with it, and like to it,
perceived by sense, created, always in motion, becoming in place and
again vanishing out of place, which is apprehended by opinion and sense.
and there is a third nature, which is space, and is eternal, and admits
not of destruction and provides a home for all created things, and is
apprehended without the help of sense, by a kind of spurious reason, and
is hardly real; which we beholding as in a dream, say of all existence
that it must of necessity be in some place and occupy a space, but that
what is neither in heaven nor in earth has no existence. of these and
other things of the same kind, relating to the true and waking reality
of nature, we have only this dreamlike sense, and we are unable to cast
off sleep and determine the truth about them. for an image, since the
reality, after which it is modelled, does not belong to it, and it
exists ever as the fleeting shadow of some other, must be inferred to be
in another (i.e. in space), grasping existence in some way or other,
or it could not be at all. but true and exact reason, vindicating the
nature of true being, maintains that while two things (i.e. the image
and space) are different they cannot exist one of them in the other and
so be one and also two at the same time.

thus have i concisely given the result of my thoughts; and my verdict is
that being and space and generation, these three, existed in their three
ways before the heaven; and that the nurse of generation, moistened by
water and inflamed by fire, and receiving the forms of earth and air,
and experiencing all the affections which accompany these, presented
a strange variety of appearances; and being full of powers which were
neither similar nor equally balanced, was never in any part in a state
of equipoise, but swaying unevenly hither and thither, was shaken by
them, and by its motion again shook them; and the elements when moved
were separated and carried continually, some one way, some another; as,
when grain is shaken and winnowed by fans and other instruments used in
the threshing of corn, the close and heavy particles are borne away and
settle in one direction, and the loose and light particles in another.
in this manner, the four kinds or elements were then shaken by the
receiving vessel, which, moving like a winnowing machine, scattered
far away from one another the elements most unlike, and forced the most
similar elements into close contact. wherefore also the various elements
had different places before they were arranged so as to form the
universe. at first, they were all without reason and measure. but when
the world began to get into order, fire and water and earth and air had
only certain faint traces of themselves, and were altogether such as
everything might be expected to be in the absence of god; this, i
say, was their nature at that time, and god fashioned them by form and
number. let it be consistently maintained by us in all that we say that
god made them as far as possible the fairest and best, out of things
which were not fair and good. and now i will endeavour to show you the
disposition and generation of them by an unaccustomed argument, which i
am compelled to use; but i believe that you will be able to follow me,
for your education has made you familiar with the methods of science.

in the first place, then, as is evident to all, fire and earth and water
and air are bodies. and every sort of body possesses solidity, and
every solid must necessarily be contained in planes; and every plane
rectilinear figure is composed of triangles; and all triangles are
originally of two kinds, both of which are made up of one right and two
acute angles; one of them has at either end of the base the half of a
divided right angle, having equal sides, while in the other the right
angle is divided into unequal parts, having unequal sides. these, then,
proceeding by a combination of probability with demonstration, we
assume to be the original elements of fire and the other bodies; but the
principles which are prior to these god only knows, and he of men who is
the friend of god. and next we have to determine what are the four most
beautiful bodies which are unlike one another, and of which some are
capable of resolution into one another; for having discovered thus much,
we shall know the true origin of earth and fire and of the proportionate
and intermediate elements. and then we shall not be willing to allow
that there are any distinct kinds of visible bodies fairer than these.
wherefore we must endeavour to construct the four forms of bodies
which excel in beauty, and then we shall be able to say that we have
sufficiently apprehended their nature. now of the two triangles,
the isosceles has one form only; the scalene or unequal-sided has
an infinite number. of the infinite forms we must select the most
beautiful, if we are to proceed in due order, and any one who can
point out a more beautiful form than ours for the construction of these
bodies, shall carry off the palm, not as an enemy, but as a friend.
now, the one which we maintain to be the most beautiful of all the many
triangles (and we need not speak of the others) is that of which the
double forms a third triangle which is equilateral; the reason of this
would be long to tell; he who disproves what we are saying, and shows
that we are mistaken, may claim a friendly victory. then let us choose
two triangles, out of which fire and the other elements have been
constructed, one isosceles, the other having the square of the longer
side equal to three times the square of the lesser side.

now is the time to explain what was before obscurely said: there was an
error in imagining that all the four elements might be generated by and
into one another; this, i say, was an erroneous supposition, for
there are generated from the triangles which we have selected four
kinds--three from the one which has the sides unequal; the fourth
alone is framed out of the isosceles triangle. hence they cannot all be
resolved into one another, a great number of small bodies being combined
into a few large ones, or the converse. but three of them can be thus
resolved and compounded, for they all spring from one, and when the
greater bodies are broken up, many small bodies will spring up out
of them and take their own proper figures; or, again, when many small
bodies are dissolved into their triangles, if they become one, they will
form one large mass of another kind. so much for their passage into one
another. i have now to speak of their several kinds, and show out of
what combinations of numbers each of them was formed. the first will be
the simplest and smallest construction, and its element is that triangle
which has its hypotenuse twice the lesser side. when two such triangles
are joined at the diagonal, and this is repeated three times, and the
triangles rest their diagonals and shorter sides on the same point as
a centre, a single equilateral triangle is formed out of six triangles;
and four equilateral triangles, if put together, make out of every three
plane angles one solid angle, being that which is nearest to the most
obtuse of plane angles; and out of the combination of these four angles
arises the first solid form which distributes into equal and similar
parts the whole circle in which it is inscribed. the second species
of solid is formed out of the same triangles, which unite as eight
equilateral triangles and form one solid angle out of four plane angles,
and out of six such angles the second body is completed. and the third
body is made up of 120 triangular elements, forming twelve solid angles,
each of them included in five plane equilateral triangles, having
altogether twenty bases, each of which is an equilateral triangle. the
one element (that is, the triangle which has its hypotenuse twice the
lesser side) having generated these figures, generated no more; but
the isosceles triangle produced the fourth elementary figure, which
is compounded of four such triangles, joining their right angles in a
centre, and forming one equilateral quadrangle. six of these united form
eight solid angles, each of which is made by the combination of three
plane right angles; the figure of the body thus composed is a cube,
having six plane quadrangular equilateral bases. there was yet a fifth
combination which god used in the delineation of the universe.

now, he who, duly reflecting on all this, enquires whether the worlds
are to be regarded as indefinite or definite in number, will be of
opinion that the notion of their indefiniteness is characteristic of a
sadly indefinite and ignorant mind. he, however, who raises the question
whether they are to be truly regarded as one or five, takes up a more
reasonable position. arguing from probabilities, i am of opinion that
they are one; another, regarding the question from another point of
view, will be of another mind. but, leaving this enquiry, let us proceed
to distribute the elementary forms, which have now been created in idea,
among the four elements.

to earth, then, let us assign the cubical form; for earth is the most
immoveable of the four and the most plastic of all bodies, and that
which has the most stable bases must of necessity be of such a nature.
now, of the triangles which we assumed at first, that which has two
equal sides is by nature more firmly based than that which has unequal
sides; and of the compound figures which are formed out of either, the
plane equilateral quadrangle has necessarily a more stable basis than
the equilateral triangle, both in the whole and in the parts. wherefore,
in assigning this figure to earth, we adhere to probability; and to
water we assign that one of the remaining forms which is the least
moveable; and the most moveable of them to fire; and to air that which
is intermediate. also we assign the smallest body to fire, and the
greatest to water, and the intermediate in size to air; and, again, the
acutest body to fire, and the next in acuteness to air, and the third
to water. of all these elements, that which has the fewest bases must
necessarily be the most moveable, for it must be the acutest and most
penetrating in every way, and also the lightest as being composed of the
smallest number of similar particles: and the second body has similar
properties in a second degree, and the third body in the third degree.
let it be agreed, then, both according to strict reason and according to
probability, that the pyramid is the solid which is the original element
and seed of fire; and let us assign the element which was next in the
order of generation to air, and the third to water. we must imagine all
these to be so small that no single particle of any of the four kinds
is seen by us on account of their smallness: but when many of them are
collected together their aggregates are seen. and the ratios of their
numbers, motions, and other properties, everywhere god, as far as
necessity allowed or gave consent, has exactly perfected, and harmonized
in due proportion.

from all that we have just been saying about the elements or kinds, the
most probable conclusion is as follows:--earth, when meeting with fire
and dissolved by its sharpness, whether the dissolution take place in
the fire itself or perhaps in some mass of air or water, is borne hither
and thither, until its parts, meeting together and mutually harmonising,
again become earth; for they can never take any other form. but water,
when divided by fire or by air, on re-forming, may become one part fire
and two parts air; and a single volume of air divided becomes two of
fire. again, when a small body of fire is contained in a larger body of
air or water or earth, and both are moving, and the fire struggling is
overcome and broken up, then two volumes of fire form one volume of air;
and when air is overcome and cut up into small pieces, two and a half
parts of air are condensed into one part of water. let us consider the
matter in another way. when one of the other elements is fastened
upon by fire, and is cut by the sharpness of its angles and sides, it
coalesces with the fire, and then ceases to be cut by them any longer.
for no element which is one and the same with itself can be changed by
or change another of the same kind and in the same state. but so long
as in the process of transition the weaker is fighting against the
stronger, the dissolution continues. again, when a few small particles,
enclosed in many larger ones, are in process of decomposition and
extinction, they only cease from their tendency to extinction when they
consent to pass into the conquering nature, and fire becomes air and air
water. but if bodies of another kind go and attack them (i.e. the small
particles), the latter continue to be dissolved until, being completely
forced back and dispersed, they make their escape to their own kindred,
or else, being overcome and assimilated to the conquering power, they
remain where they are and dwell with their victors, and from being many
become one. and owing to these affections, all things are changing their
place, for by the motion of the receiving vessel the bulk of each class
is distributed into its proper place; but those things which become
unlike themselves and like other things, are hurried by the shaking into
the place of the things to which they grow like.

now all unmixed and primary bodies are produced by such causes as these.
as to the subordinate species which are included in the greater kinds,
they are to be attributed to the varieties in the structure of the two
original triangles. for either structure did not originally produce the
triangle of one size only, but some larger and some smaller, and there
are as many sizes as there are species of the four elements. hence
when they are mingled with themselves and with one another there is an
endless variety of them, which those who would arrive at the probable
truth of nature ought duly to consider.

unless a person comes to an understanding about the nature and
conditions of rest and motion, he will meet with many difficulties in
the discussion which follows. something has been said of this matter
already, and something more remains to be said, which is, that motion
never exists in what is uniform. for to conceive that anything can
be moved without a mover is hard or indeed impossible, and equally
impossible to conceive that there can be a mover unless there be
something which can be moved--motion cannot exist where either of these
are wanting, and for these to be uniform is impossible; wherefore we
must assign rest to uniformity and motion to the want of uniformity. now
inequality is the cause of the nature which is wanting in uniformity;
and of this we have already described the origin. but there still
remains the further point--why things when divided after their kinds do
not cease to pass through one another and to change their place--which
we will now proceed to explain. in the revolution of the universe are
comprehended all the four elements, and this being circular and having a
tendency to come together, compresses everything and will not allow any
place to be left void. wherefore, also, fire above all things penetrates
everywhere, and air next, as being next in rarity of the elements;
and the two other elements in like manner penetrate according to their
degrees of rarity. for those things which are composed of the largest
particles have the largest void left in their compositions, and those
which are composed of the smallest particles have the least. and the
contraction caused by the compression thrusts the smaller particles into
the interstices of the larger. and thus, when the small parts are placed
side by side with the larger, and the lesser divide the greater and the
greater unite the lesser, all the elements are borne up and down and
hither and thither towards their own places; for the change in the size
of each changes its position in space. and these causes generate an
inequality which is always maintained, and is continually creating a
perpetual motion of the elements in all time.

in the next place we have to consider that there are divers kinds
of fire. there are, for example, first, flame; and secondly, those
emanations of flame which do not burn but only give light to the eyes;
thirdly, the remains of fire, which are seen in red-hot embers after the
flame has been extinguished. there are similar differences in the air;
of which the brightest part is called the aether, and the most turbid
sort mist and darkness; and there are various other nameless kinds which
arise from the inequality of the triangles. water, again, admits in the
first place of a division into two kinds; the one liquid and the other
fusile. the liquid kind is composed of the small and unequal particles
of water; and moves itself and is moved by other bodies owing to the
want of uniformity and the shape of its particles; whereas the fusile
kind, being formed of large and uniform particles, is more stable than
the other, and is heavy and compact by reason of its uniformity.
but when fire gets in and dissolves the particles and destroys the
uniformity, it has greater mobility, and becoming fluid is thrust forth
by the neighbouring air and spreads upon the earth; and this dissolution
of the solid masses is called melting, and their spreading out upon the
earth flowing. again, when the fire goes out of the fusile substance, it
does not pass into a vacuum, but into the neighbouring air; and the air
which is displaced forces together the liquid and still moveable mass
into the place which was occupied by the fire, and unites it with
itself. thus compressed the mass resumes its equability, and is again
at unity with itself, because the fire which was the author of the
inequality has retreated; and this departure of the fire is called
cooling, and the coming together which follows upon it is termed
congealment. of all the kinds termed fusile, that which is the densest
and is formed out of the finest and most uniform parts is that most
precious possession called gold, which is hardened by filtration through
rock; this is unique in kind, and has both a glittering and a yellow
colour. a shoot of gold, which is so dense as to be very hard, and takes
a black colour, is termed adamant. there is also another kind which has
parts nearly like gold, and of which there are several species; it is
denser than gold, and it contains a small and fine portion of earth, and
is therefore harder, yet also lighter because of the great interstices
which it has within itself; and this substance, which is one of the
bright and denser kinds of water, when solidified is called copper.
there is an alloy of earth mingled with it, which, when the two parts
grow old and are disunited, shows itself separately and is called rust.
the remaining phenomena of the same kind there will be no difficulty in
reasoning out by the method of probabilities. a man may sometimes set
aside meditations about eternal things, and for recreation turn to
consider the truths of generation which are probable only; he will thus
gain a pleasure not to be repented of, and secure for himself while
he lives a wise and moderate pastime. let us grant ourselves this
indulgence, and go through the probabilities relating to the same
subjects which follow next in order.

water which is mingled with fire, so much as is fine and liquid (being
so called by reason of its motion and the way in which it rolls along
the ground), and soft, because its bases give way and are less stable
than those of earth, when separated from fire and air and isolated,
becomes more uniform, and by their retirement is compressed into itself;
and if the condensation be very great, the water above the earth becomes
hail, but on the earth, ice; and that which is congealed in a less
degree and is only half solid, when above the earth is called snow, and
when upon the earth, and condensed from dew, hoar-frost. then, again,
there are the numerous kinds of water which have been mingled with one
another, and are distilled through plants which grow in the earth; and
this whole class is called by the name of juices or saps. the unequal
admixture of these fluids creates a variety of species; most of them are
nameless, but four which are of a fiery nature are clearly distinguished
and have names. first, there is wine, which warms the soul as well
as the body: secondly, there is the oily nature, which is smooth and
divides the visual ray, and for this reason is bright and shining and of
a glistening appearance, including pitch, the juice of the castor berry,
oil itself, and other things of a like kind: thirdly, there is the class
of substances which expand the contracted parts of the mouth, until they
return to their natural state, and by reason of this property create
sweetness;--these are included under the general name of honey: and,
lastly, there is a frothy nature, which differs from all juices, having
a burning quality which dissolves the flesh; it is called opos (a
vegetable acid).

as to the kinds of earth, that which is filtered through water passes
into stone in the following manner:--the water which mixes with the
earth and is broken up in the process changes into air, and taking this
form mounts into its own place. but as there is no surrounding vacuum it
thrusts away the neighbouring air, and this being rendered heavy, and,
when it is displaced, having been poured around the mass of earth,
forcibly compresses it and drives it into the vacant space whence the
new air had come up; and the earth when compressed by the air into an
indissoluble union with water becomes rock. the fairer sort is that
which is made up of equal and similar parts and is transparent; that
which has the opposite qualities is inferior. but when all the watery
part is suddenly drawn out by fire, a more brittle substance is formed,
to which we give the name of pottery. sometimes also moisture may
remain, and the earth which has been fused by fire becomes, when cool,
a certain stone of a black colour. a like separation of the water
which had been copiously mingled with them may occur in two substances
composed of finer particles of earth and of a briny nature; out of
either of them a half-solid-body is then formed, soluble in water--the
one, soda, which is used for purging away oil and earth, the other,
salt, which harmonizes so well in combinations pleasing to the palate,
and is, as the law testifies, a substance dear to the gods. the
compounds of earth and water are not soluble by water, but by fire only,
and for this reason:--neither fire nor air melt masses of earth; for
their particles, being smaller than the interstices in its structure,
have plenty of room to move without forcing their way, and so they leave
the earth unmelted and undissolved; but particles of water, which are
larger, force a passage, and dissolve and melt the earth. wherefore
earth when not consolidated by force is dissolved by water only; when
consolidated, by nothing but fire; for this is the only body which can
find an entrance. the cohesion of water again, when very strong, is
dissolved by fire only--when weaker, then either by air or fire--the
former entering the interstices, and the latter penetrating even the
triangles. but nothing can dissolve air, when strongly condensed, which
does not reach the elements or triangles; or if not strongly condensed,
then only fire can dissolve it. as to bodies composed of earth and
water, while the water occupies the vacant interstices of the earth
in them which are compressed by force, the particles of water which
approach them from without, finding no entrance, flow around the entire
mass and leave it undissolved; but the particles of fire, entering into
the interstices of the water, do to the water what water does to earth
and fire to air (the text seems to be corrupt.), and are the sole causes
of the compound body of earth and water liquefying and becoming fluid.
now these bodies are of two kinds; some of them, such as glass and the
fusible sort of stones, have less water than they have earth; on the
other hand, substances of the nature of wax and incense have more of
water entering into their composition.

i have thus shown the various classes of bodies as they are diversified
by their forms and combinations and changes into one another, and now i
must endeavour to set forth their affections and the causes of them. in
the first place, the bodies which i have been describing are necessarily
objects of sense. but we have not yet considered the origin of flesh, or
what belongs to flesh, or of that part of the soul which is mortal. and
these things cannot be adequately explained without also explaining the
affections which are concerned with sensation, nor the latter without
the former: and yet to explain them together is hardly possible; for
which reason we must assume first one or the other and afterwards
examine the nature of our hypothesis. in order, then, that the
affections may follow regularly after the elements, let us presuppose
the existence of body and soul.

first, let us enquire what we mean by saying that fire is hot; and about
this we may reason from the dividing or cutting power which it exercises
on our bodies. we all of us feel that fire is sharp; and we may further
consider the fineness of the sides, and the sharpness of the angles,
and the smallness of the particles, and the swiftness of the motion--all
this makes the action of fire violent and sharp, so that it cuts
whatever it meets. and we must not forget that the original figure of
fire (i.e. the pyramid), more than any other form, has a dividing power
which cuts our bodies into small pieces (kepmatizei), and thus naturally
produces that affection which we call heat; and hence the origin of
the name (thepmos, kepma). now, the opposite of this is sufficiently
manifest; nevertheless we will not fail to describe it. for the larger
particles of moisture which surround the body, entering in and driving
out the lesser, but not being able to take their places, compress the
moist principle in us; and this from being unequal and disturbed, is
forced by them into a state of rest, which is due to equability and
compression. but things which are contracted contrary to nature are
by nature at war, and force themselves apart; and to this war and
convulsion the name of shivering and trembling is given; and the whole
affection and the cause of the affection are both termed cold. that
is called hard to which our flesh yields, and soft which yields to
our flesh; and things are also termed hard and soft relatively to one
another. that which yields has a small base; but that which rests on
quadrangular bases is firmly posed and belongs to the class which offers
the greatest resistance; so too does that which is the most compact and
therefore most repellent. the nature of the light and the heavy will be
best understood when examined in connexion with our notions of above and
below; for it is quite a mistake to suppose that the universe is parted
into two regions, separate from and opposite to each other, the one
a lower to which all things tend which have any bulk, and an upper to
which things only ascend against their will. for as the universe is in
the form of a sphere, all the extremities, being equidistant from the
centre, are equally extremities, and the centre, which is equidistant
from them, is equally to be regarded as the opposite of them all. such
being the nature of the world, when a person says that any of these
points is above or below, may he not be justly charged with using an
improper expression? for the centre of the world cannot be rightly
called either above or below, but is the centre and nothing else; and
the circumference is not the centre, and has in no one part of itself a
different relation to the centre from what it has in any of the opposite
parts. indeed, when it is in every direction similar, how can one
rightly give to it names which imply opposition? for if there were any
solid body in equipoise at the centre of the universe, there would be
nothing to draw it to this extreme rather than to that, for they are
all perfectly similar; and if a person were to go round the world in
a circle, he would often, when standing at the antipodes of his former
position, speak of the same point as above and below; for, as i was
saying just now, to speak of the whole which is in the form of a globe
as having one part above and another below is not like a sensible man.
the reason why these names are used, and the circumstances under which
they are ordinarily applied by us to the division of the heavens, may be
elucidated by the following supposition:--if a person were to stand
in that part of the universe which is the appointed place of fire, and
where there is the great mass of fire to which fiery bodies gather--if,
i say, he were to ascend thither, and, having the power to do this, were
to abstract particles of fire and put them in scales and weigh them, and
then, raising the balance, were to draw the fire by force towards the
uncongenial element of the air, it would be very evident that he could
compel the smaller mass more readily than the larger; for when two
things are simultaneously raised by one and the same power, the smaller
body must necessarily yield to the superior power with less reluctance
than the larger; and the larger body is called heavy and said to
tend downwards, and the smaller body is called light and said to tend
upwards. and we may detect ourselves who are upon the earth doing
precisely the same thing. for we often separate earthy natures, and
sometimes earth itself, and draw them into the uncongenial element of
air by force and contrary to nature, both clinging to their kindred
elements. but that which is smaller yields to the impulse given by us
towards the dissimilar element more easily than the larger; and so we
call the former light, and the place towards which it is impelled we
call above, and the contrary state and place we call heavy and below
respectively. now the relations of these must necessarily vary, because
the principal masses of the different elements hold opposite positions;
for that which is light, heavy, below or above in one place will be
found to be and become contrary and transverse and every way diverse in
relation to that which is light, heavy, below or above in an opposite
place. and about all of them this has to be considered:--that the
tendency of each towards its kindred element makes the body which is
moved heavy, and the place towards which the motion tends below, but
things which have an opposite tendency we call by an opposite name. such
are the causes which we assign to these phenomena. as to the smooth
and the rough, any one who sees them can explain the reason of them
to another. for roughness is hardness mingled with irregularity, and
smoothness is produced by the joint effect of uniformity and density.

the most important of the affections which concern the whole body
remains to be considered--that is, the cause of pleasure and pain in the
perceptions of which i have been speaking, and in all other things which
are perceived by sense through the parts of the body, and have both
pains and pleasures attendant on them. let us imagine the causes of
every affection, whether of sense or not, to be of the following nature,
remembering that we have already distinguished between the nature which
is easy and which is hard to move; for this is the direction in which we
must hunt the prey which we mean to take. a body which is of a nature
to be easily moved, on receiving an impression however slight, spreads
abroad the motion in a circle, the parts communicating with each other,
until at last, reaching the principle of mind, they announce the quality
of the agent. but a body of the opposite kind, being immobile, and not
extending to the surrounding region, merely receives the impression, and
does not stir any of the neighbouring parts; and since the parts do not
distribute the original impression to other parts, it has no effect
of motion on the whole animal, and therefore produces no effect on the
patient. this is true of the bones and hair and other more earthy parts
of the human body; whereas what was said above relates mainly to sight
and hearing, because they have in them the greatest amount of fire
and air. now we must conceive of pleasure and pain in this way. an
impression produced in us contrary to nature and violent, if sudden,
is painful; and, again, the sudden return to nature is pleasant; but a
gentle and gradual return is imperceptible and vice versa. on the other
hand the impression of sense which is most easily produced is most
readily felt, but is not accompanied by pleasure or pain; such, for
example, are the affections of the sight, which, as we said above, is a
body naturally uniting with our body in the day-time; for cuttings and
burnings and other affections which happen to the sight do not give
pain, nor is there pleasure when the sight returns to its natural state;
but the sensations are clearest and strongest according to the manner in
which the eye is affected by the object, and itself strikes and touches
it; there is no violence either in the contraction or dilation of the
eye. but bodies formed of larger particles yield to the agent only with
a struggle; and then they impart their motions to the whole and cause
pleasure and pain--pain when alienated from their natural conditions,
and pleasure when restored to them. things which experience gradual
withdrawings and emptyings of their nature, and great and sudden
replenishments, fail to perceive the emptying, but are sensible of the
replenishment; and so they occasion no pain, but the greatest pleasure,
to the mortal part of the soul, as is manifest in the case of perfumes.
but things which are changed all of a sudden, and only gradually and
with difficulty return to their own nature, have effects in every
way opposite to the former, as is evident in the case of burnings and
cuttings of the body.

thus have we discussed the general affections of the whole body, and
the names of the agents which produce them. and now i will endeavour to
speak of the affections of particular parts, and the causes and agents
of them, as far as i am able. in the first place let us set forth what
was omitted when we were speaking of juices, concerning the affections
peculiar to the tongue. these too, like most of the other affections,
appear to be caused by certain contractions and dilations, but they
have besides more of roughness and smoothness than is found in other
affections; for whenever earthy particles enter into the small veins
which are the testing instruments of the tongue, reaching to the heart,
and fall upon the moist, delicate portions of flesh--when, as they
are dissolved, they contract and dry up the little veins, they are
astringent if they are rougher, but if not so rough, then only harsh.
those of them which are of an abstergent nature, and purge the whole
surface of the tongue, if they do it in excess, and so encroach as to
consume some part of the flesh itself, like potash and soda, are all
termed bitter. but the particles which are deficient in the alkaline
quality, and which cleanse only moderately, are called salt, and having
no bitterness or roughness, are regarded as rather agreeable than
otherwise. bodies which share in and are made smooth by the heat of
the mouth, and which are inflamed, and again in turn inflame that which
heats them, and which are so light that they are carried upwards to the
sensations of the head, and cut all that comes in their way, by reason
of these qualities in them, are all termed pungent. but when these same
particles, refined by putrefaction, enter into the narrow veins, and
are duly proportioned to the particles of earth and air which are there,
they set them whirling about one another, and while they are in a whirl
cause them to dash against and enter into one another, and so form
hollows surrounding the particles that enter--which watery vessels of
air (for a film of moisture, sometimes earthy, sometimes pure, is spread
around the air) are hollow spheres of water; and those of them which are
pure, are transparent, and are called bubbles, while those composed
of the earthy liquid, which is in a state of general agitation and
effervescence, are said to boil or ferment--of all these affections the
cause is termed acid. and there is the opposite affection arising from
an opposite cause, when the mass of entering particles, immersed in the
moisture of the mouth, is congenial to the tongue, and smooths and
oils over the roughness, and relaxes the parts which are unnaturally
contracted, and contracts the parts which are relaxed, and disposes
them all according to their nature;--that sort of remedy of violent
affections is pleasant and agreeable to every man, and has the name
sweet. but enough of this.

the faculty of smell does not admit of differences of kind; for all
smells are of a half-formed nature, and no element is so proportioned
as to have any smell. the veins about the nose are too narrow to admit
earth and water, and too wide to detain fire and air; and for this
reason no one ever perceives the smell of any of them; but smells always
proceed from bodies that are damp, or putrefying, or liquefying, or
evaporating, and are perceptible only in the intermediate state, when
water is changing into air and air into water; and all of them are
either vapour or mist. that which is passing out of air into water is
mist, and that which is passing from water into air is vapour; and hence
all smells are thinner than water and thicker than air. the proof of
this is, that when there is any obstruction to the respiration, and a
man draws in his breath by force, then no smell filters through, but the
air without the smell alone penetrates. wherefore the varieties of smell
have no name, and they have not many, or definite and simple kinds;
but they are distinguished only as painful and pleasant, the one sort
irritating and disturbing the whole cavity which is situated between the
head and the navel, the other having a soothing influence, and restoring
this same region to an agreeable and natural condition.

in considering the third kind of sense, hearing, we must speak of the
causes in which it originates. we may in general assume sound to be a
blow which passes through the ears, and is transmitted by means of the
air, the brain, and the blood, to the soul, and that hearing is the
vibration of this blow, which begins in the head and ends in the region
of the liver. the sound which moves swiftly is acute, and the sound
which moves slowly is grave, and that which is regular is equable and
smooth, and the reverse is harsh. a great body of sound is loud, and
a small body of sound the reverse. respecting the harmonies of sound i
must hereafter speak.

there is a fourth class of sensible things, having many intricate
varieties, which must now be distinguished. they are called by the
general name of colours, and are a flame which emanates from every sort
of body, and has particles corresponding to the sense of sight. i have
spoken already, in what has preceded, of the causes which generate
sight, and in this place it will be natural and suitable to give a
rational theory of colours.

of the particles coming from other bodies which fall upon the sight,
some are smaller and some are larger, and some are equal to the parts of
the sight itself. those which are equal are imperceptible, and we call
them transparent. the larger produce contraction, the smaller dilation,
in the sight, exercising a power akin to that of hot and cold bodies on
the flesh, or of astringent bodies on the tongue, or of those heating
bodies which we termed pungent. white and black are similar effects of
contraction and dilation in another sphere, and for this reason have
a different appearance. wherefore, we ought to term white that which
dilates the visual ray, and the opposite of this is black. there is also
a swifter motion of a different sort of fire which strikes and dilates
the ray of sight until it reaches the eyes, forcing a way through their
passages and melting them, and eliciting from them a union of fire and
water which we call tears, being itself an opposite fire which comes
to them from an opposite direction--the inner fire flashes forth like
lightning, and the outer finds a way in and is extinguished in the
moisture, and all sorts of colours are generated by the mixture. this
affection is termed dazzling, and the object which produces it is
called bright and flashing. there is another sort of fire which is
intermediate, and which reaches and mingles with the moisture of the
eye without flashing; and in this, the fire mingling with the ray of
the moisture, produces a colour like blood, to which we give the name
of red. a bright hue mingled with red and white gives the colour called
auburn (greek). the law of proportion, however, according to which the
several colours are formed, even if a man knew he would be foolish in
telling, for he could not give any necessary reason, nor indeed any
tolerable or probable explanation of them. again, red, when mingled with
black and white, becomes purple, but it becomes umber (greek) when the
colours are burnt as well as mingled and the black is more thoroughly
mixed with them. flame-colour (greek) is produced by a union of auburn
and dun (greek), and dun by an admixture of black and white; pale yellow
(greek), by an admixture of white and auburn. white and bright meeting,
and falling upon a full black, become dark blue (greek), and when dark
blue mingles with white, a light blue (greek) colour is formed, as
flame-colour with black makes leek green (greek). there will be no
difficulty in seeing how and by what mixtures the colours derived from
these are made according to the rules of probability. he, however,
who should attempt to verify all this by experiment, would forget
the difference of the human and divine nature. for god only has the
knowledge and also the power which are able to combine many things into
one and again resolve the one into many. but no man either is or ever
will be able to accomplish either the one or the other operation.

these are the elements, thus of necessity then subsisting, which the
creator of the fairest and best of created things associated with
himself, when he made the self-sufficing and most perfect god, using the
necessary causes as his ministers in the accomplishment of his work,
but himself contriving the good in all his creations. wherefore we may
distinguish two sorts of causes, the one divine and the other necessary,
and may seek for the divine in all things, as far as our nature admits,
with a view to the blessed life; but the necessary kind only for the
sake of the divine, considering that without them and when isolated from
them, these higher things for which we look cannot be apprehended or
received or in any way shared by us.

seeing, then, that we have now prepared for our use the various classes
of causes which are the material out of which the remainder of our
discourse must be woven, just as wood is the material of the carpenter,
let us revert in a few words to the point at which we began, and then
endeavour to add on a suitable ending to the beginning of our tale.

as i said at first, when all things were in disorder god created in
each thing in relation to itself, and in all things in relation to each
other, all the measures and harmonies which they could possibly receive.
for in those days nothing had any proportion except by accident; nor did
any of the things which now have names deserve to be named at all--as,
for example, fire, water, and the rest of the elements. all these the
creator first set in order, and out of them he constructed the universe,
which was a single animal comprehending in itself all other animals,
mortal and immortal. now of the divine, he himself was the creator,
but the creation of the mortal he committed to his offspring. and they,
imitating him, received from him the immortal principle of the soul; and
around this they proceeded to fashion a mortal body, and made it to
be the vehicle of the soul, and constructed within the body a soul of
another nature which was mortal, subject to terrible and irresistible
affections,--first of all, pleasure, the greatest incitement to evil;
then, pain, which deters from good; also rashness and fear, two
foolish counsellors, anger hard to be appeased, and hope easily led
astray;--these they mingled with irrational sense and with all-daring
love according to necessary laws, and so framed man. wherefore, fearing
to pollute the divine any more than was absolutely unavoidable, they
gave to the mortal nature a separate habitation in another part of the
body, placing the neck between them to be the isthmus and boundary,
which they constructed between the head and breast, to keep them apart.
and in the breast, and in what is termed the thorax, they encased the
mortal soul; and as the one part of this was superior and the other
inferior they divided the cavity of the thorax into two parts, as the
women's and men's apartments are divided in houses, and placed the
midriff to be a wall of partition between them. that part of the
inferior soul which is endowed with courage and passion and loves
contention they settled nearer the head, midway between the midriff and
the neck, in order that it might be under the rule of reason and might
join with it in controlling and restraining the desires when they are no
longer willing of their own accord to obey the word of command issuing
from the citadel.

the heart, the knot of the veins and the fountain of the blood which
races through all the limbs, was set in the place of guard, that when
the might of passion was roused by reason making proclamation of any
wrong assailing them from without or being perpetrated by the desires
within, quickly the whole power of feeling in the body, perceiving
these commands and threats, might obey and follow through every turn and
alley, and thus allow the principle of the best to have the command in
all of them. but the gods, foreknowing that the palpitation of the heart
in the expectation of danger and the swelling and excitement of passion
was caused by fire, formed and implanted as a supporter to the heart the
lung, which was, in the first place, soft and bloodless, and also had
within hollows like the pores of a sponge, in order that by receiving
the breath and the drink, it might give coolness and the power of
respiration and alleviate the heat. wherefore they cut the air-channels
leading to the lung, and placed the lung about the heart as a soft
spring, that, when passion was rife within, the heart, beating against
a yielding body, might be cooled and suffer less, and might thus become
more ready to join with passion in the service of reason.

the part of the soul which desires meats and drinks and the other things
of which it has need by reason of the bodily nature, they placed between
the midriff and the boundary of the navel, contriving in all this region
a sort of manger for the food of the body; and there they bound it down
like a wild animal which was chained up with man, and must be nourished
if man was to exist. they appointed this lower creation his place here
in order that he might be always feeding at the manger, and have his
dwelling as far as might be from the council-chamber, making as little
noise and disturbance as possible, and permitting the best part to
advise quietly for the good of the whole. and knowing that this lower
principle in man would not comprehend reason, and even if attaining
to some degree of perception would never naturally care for rational
notions, but that it would be led away by phantoms and visions night
and day,--to be a remedy for this, god combined with it the liver, and
placed it in the house of the lower nature, contriving that it should
be solid and smooth, and bright and sweet, and should also have a bitter
quality, in order that the power of thought, which proceeds from the
mind, might be reflected as in a mirror which receives likenesses of
objects and gives back images of them to the sight; and so might strike
terror into the desires, when, making use of the bitter part of the
liver, to which it is akin, it comes threatening and invading, and
diffusing this bitter element swiftly through the whole liver produces
colours like bile, and contracting every part makes it wrinkled and
rough; and twisting out of its right place and contorting the lobe and
closing and shutting up the vessels and gates, causes pain and
loathing. and the converse happens when some gentle inspiration of the
understanding pictures images of an opposite character, and allays the
bile and bitterness by refusing to stir or touch the nature opposed
to itself, but by making use of the natural sweetness of the liver,
corrects all things and makes them to be right and smooth and free, and
renders the portion of the soul which resides about the liver happy
and joyful, enabling it to pass the night in peace, and to practise
divination in sleep, inasmuch as it has no share in mind and reason. for
the authors of our being, remembering the command of their father when
he bade them create the human race as good as they could, that they
might correct our inferior parts and make them to attain a measure of
truth, placed in the liver the seat of divination. and herein is a proof
that god has given the art of divination not to the wisdom, but to the
foolishness of man. no man, when in his wits, attains prophetic truth
and inspiration; but when he receives the inspired word, either his
intelligence is enthralled in sleep, or he is demented by some distemper
or possession. and he who would understand what he remembers to have
been said, whether in a dream or when he was awake, by the prophetic
and inspired nature, or would determine by reason the meaning of the
apparitions which he has seen, and what indications they afford to
this man or that, of past, present or future good and evil, must first
recover his wits. but, while he continues demented, he cannot judge
of the visions which he sees or the words which he utters; the ancient
saying is very true, that 'only a man who has his wits can act or judge
about himself and his own affairs.' and for this reason it is customary
to appoint interpreters to be judges of the true inspiration. some
persons call them prophets; they are quite unaware that they are only
the expositors of dark sayings and visions, and are not to be called
prophets at all, but only interpreters of prophecy.

such is the nature of the liver, which is placed as we have described
in order that it may give prophetic intimations. during the life of each
individual these intimations are plainer, but after his death the liver
becomes blind, and delivers oracles too obscure to be intelligible. the
neighbouring organ (the spleen) is situated on the left-hand side, and
is constructed with a view of keeping the liver bright and pure,--like
a napkin, always ready prepared and at hand to clean the mirror. and
hence, when any impurities arise in the region of the liver by reason of
disorders of the body, the loose nature of the spleen, which is composed
of a hollow and bloodless tissue, receives them all and clears them
away, and when filled with the unclean matter, swells and festers, but,
again, when the body is purged, settles down into the same place as
before, and is humbled.

concerning the soul, as to which part is mortal and which divine, and
how and why they are separated, and where located, if god acknowledges
that we have spoken the truth, then, and then only, can we be confident;
still, we may venture to assert that what has been said by us is
probable, and will be rendered more probable by investigation. let us
assume thus much.

the creation of the rest of the body follows next in order, and this we
may investigate in a similar manner. and it appears to be very meet that
the body should be framed on the following principles:--

the authors of our race were aware that we should be intemperate in
eating and drinking, and take a good deal more than was necessary or
proper, by reason of gluttony. in order then that disease might not
quickly destroy us, and lest our mortal race should perish without
fulfilling its end--intending to provide against this, the gods made
what is called the lower belly, to be a receptacle for the superfluous
meat and drink, and formed the convolution of the bowels, so that the
food might be prevented from passing quickly through and compelling
the body to require more food, thus producing insatiable gluttony, and
making the whole race an enemy to philosophy and music, and rebellious
against the divinest element within us.

the bones and flesh, and other similar parts of us, were made as
follows. the first principle of all of them was the generation of the
marrow. for the bonds of life which unite the soul with the body are
made fast there, and they are the root and foundation of the human race.
the marrow itself is created out of other materials: god took such of
the primary triangles as were straight and smooth, and were adapted by
their perfection to produce fire and water, and air and earth--these, i
say, he separated from their kinds, and mingling them in due proportions
with one another, made the marrow out of them to be a universal seed of
the whole race of mankind; and in this seed he then planted and enclosed
the souls, and in the original distribution gave to the marrow as many
and various forms as the different kinds of souls were hereafter to
receive. that which, like a field, was to receive the divine seed, he
made round every way, and called that portion of the marrow, brain,
intending that, when an animal was perfected, the vessel containing this
substance should be the head; but that which was intended to contain
the remaining and mortal part of the soul he distributed into figures at
once round and elongated, and he called them all by the name 'marrow';
and to these, as to anchors, fastening the bonds of the whole soul,
he proceeded to fashion around them the entire framework of our body,
constructing for the marrow, first of all a complete covering of bone.

bone was composed by him in the following manner. having sifted pure and
smooth earth he kneaded it and wetted it with marrow, and after that he
put it into fire and then into water, and once more into fire and again
into water--in this way by frequent transfers from one to the other he
made it insoluble by either. out of this he fashioned, as in a lathe,
a globe made of bone, which he placed around the brain, and in this he
left a narrow opening; and around the marrow of the neck and back
he formed vertebrae which he placed under one another like pivots,
beginning at the head and extending through the whole of the trunk.
thus wishing to preserve the entire seed, he enclosed it in a stone-like
casing, inserting joints, and using in the formation of them the power
of the other or diverse as an intermediate nature, that they might have
motion and flexure. then again, considering that the bone would be too
brittle and inflexible, and when heated and again cooled would soon
mortify and destroy the seed within--having this in view, he contrived
the sinews and the flesh, that so binding all the members together by
the sinews, which admitted of being stretched and relaxed about the
vertebrae, he might thus make the body capable of flexion and extension,
while the flesh would serve as a protection against the summer heat
and against the winter cold, and also against falls, softly and easily
yielding to external bodies, like articles made of felt; and containing
in itself a warm moisture which in summer exudes and makes the surface
damp, would impart a natural coolness to the whole body; and again in
winter by the help of this internal warmth would form a very tolerable
defence against the frost which surrounds it and attacks it from
without. he who modelled us, considering these things, mixed earth with
fire and water and blended them; and making a ferment of acid and salt,
he mingled it with them and formed soft and succulent flesh. as for
the sinews, he made them of a mixture of bone and unfermented flesh,
attempered so as to be in a mean, and gave them a yellow colour;
wherefore the sinews have a firmer and more glutinous nature than flesh,
but a softer and moister nature than the bones. with these god covered
the bones and marrow, binding them together by sinews, and then
enshrouded them all in an upper covering of flesh. the more living and
sensitive of the bones he enclosed in the thinnest film of flesh, and
those which had the least life within them in the thickest and most
solid flesh. so again on the joints of the bones, where reason indicated
that no more was required, he placed only a thin covering of flesh,
that it might not interfere with the flexion of our bodies and make them
unwieldy because difficult to move; and also that it might not, by being
crowded and pressed and matted together, destroy sensation by reason of
its hardness, and impair the memory and dull the edge of intelligence.
wherefore also the thighs and the shanks and the hips, and the bones of
the arms and the forearms, and other parts which have no joints, and the
inner bones, which on account of the rarity of the soul in the marrow
are destitute of reason--all these are abundantly provided with flesh;
but such as have mind in them are in general less fleshy, except
where the creator has made some part solely of flesh in order to give
sensation,--as, for example, the tongue. but commonly this is not the
case. for the nature which comes into being and grows up in us by a law
of necessity, does not admit of the combination of solid bone and much
flesh with acute perceptions. more than any other part the framework
of the head would have had them, if they could have co-existed, and the
human race, having a strong and fleshy and sinewy head, would have had
a life twice or many times as long as it now has, and also more healthy
and free from pain. but our creators, considering whether they should
make a longer-lived race which was worse, or a shorter-lived race which
was better, came to the conclusion that every one ought to prefer a
shorter span of life, which was better, to a longer one, which was
worse; and therefore they covered the head with thin bone, but not with
flesh and sinews, since it had no joints; and thus the head was added,
having more wisdom and sensation than the rest of the body, but also
being in every man far weaker. for these reasons and after this manner
god placed the sinews at the extremity of the head, in a circle round
the neck, and glued them together by the principle of likeness and
fastened the extremities of the jawbones to them below the face, and the
other sinews he dispersed throughout the body, fastening limb to limb.
the framers of us framed the mouth, as now arranged, having teeth and
tongue and lips, with a view to the necessary and the good contriving
the way in for necessary purposes, the way out for the best purposes;
for that is necessary which enters in and gives food to the body; but
the river of speech, which flows out of a man and ministers to the
intelligence, is the fairest and noblest of all streams. still the head
could neither be left a bare frame of bones, on account of the extremes
of heat and cold in the different seasons, nor yet be allowed to
be wholly covered, and so become dull and senseless by reason of an
overgrowth of flesh. the fleshy nature was not therefore wholly dried
up, but a large sort of peel was parted off and remained over, which
is now called the skin. this met and grew by the help of the cerebral
moisture, and became the circular envelopment of the head. and the
moisture, rising up under the sutures, watered and closed in the skin
upon the crown, forming a sort of knot. the diversity of the sutures was
caused by the power of the courses of the soul and of the food, and the
more these struggled against one another the more numerous they became,
and fewer if the struggle were less violent. this skin the divine power
pierced all round with fire, and out of the punctures which were thus
made the moisture issued forth, and the liquid and heat which was pure
came away, and a mixed part which was composed of the same material as
the skin, and had a fineness equal to the punctures, was borne up by
its own impulse and extended far outside the head, but being too slow
to escape, was thrust back by the external air, and rolled up underneath
the skin, where it took root. thus the hair sprang up in the skin, being
akin to it because it is like threads of leather, but rendered harder
and closer through the pressure of the cold, by which each hair, while
in process of separation from the skin, is compressed and cooled.
wherefore the creator formed the head hairy, making use of the causes
which i have mentioned, and reflecting also that instead of flesh the
brain needed the hair to be a light covering or guard, which would give
shade in summer and shelter in winter, and at the same time would not
impede our quickness of perception. from the combination of sinew,
skin, and bone, in the structure of the finger, there arises a triple
compound, which, when dried up, takes the form of one hard skin
partaking of all three natures, and was fabricated by these second
causes, but designed by mind which is the principal cause with an eye
to the future. for our creators well knew that women and other animals
would some day be framed out of men, and they further knew that many
animals would require the use of nails for many purposes; wherefore they
fashioned in men at their first creation the rudiments of nails. for
this purpose and for these reasons they caused skin, hair, and nails to
grow at the extremities of the limbs.

and now that all the parts and members of the mortal animal had come
together, since its life of necessity consisted of fire and breath,
and it therefore wasted away by dissolution and depletion, the gods
contrived the following remedy: they mingled a nature akin to that of
man with other forms and perceptions, and thus created another kind
of animal. these are the trees and plants and seeds which have been
improved by cultivation and are now domesticated among us; anciently
there were only the wild kinds, which are older than the cultivated. for
everything that partakes of life may be truly called a living being, and
the animal of which we are now speaking partakes of the third kind of
soul, which is said to be seated between the midriff and the navel,
having no part in opinion or reason or mind, but only in feelings of
pleasure and pain and the desires which accompany them. for this nature
is always in a passive state, revolving in and about itself, repelling
the motion from without and using its own, and accordingly is not
endowed by nature with the power of observing or reflecting on its own
concerns. wherefore it lives and does not differ from a living
being, but is fixed and rooted in the same spot, having no power of
self-motion.

now after the superior powers had created all these natures to be food
for us who are of the inferior nature, they cut various channels through
the body as through a garden, that it might be watered as from a running
stream. in the first place, they cut two hidden channels or veins down
the back where the skin and the flesh join, which answered severally
to the right and left side of the body. these they let down along the
backbone, so as to have the marrow of generation between them, where it
was most likely to flourish, and in order that the stream coming down
from above might flow freely to the other parts, and equalize the
irrigation. in the next place, they divided the veins about the head,
and interlacing them, they sent them in opposite directions; those
coming from the right side they sent to the left of the body, and those
from the left they diverted towards the right, so that they and the skin
might together form a bond which should fasten the head to the body,
since the crown of the head was not encircled by sinews; and also in
order that the sensations from both sides might be distributed over the
whole body. and next, they ordered the water-courses of the body in a
manner which i will describe, and which will be more easily understood
if we begin by admitting that all things which have lesser parts retain
the greater, but the greater cannot retain the lesser. now of all
natures fire has the smallest parts, and therefore penetrates through
earth and water and air and their compounds, nor can anything hold it.
and a similar principle applies to the human belly; for when meats and
drinks enter it, it holds them, but it cannot hold air and fire, because
the particles of which they consist are smaller than its own structure.

these elements, therefore, god employed for the sake of distributing
moisture from the belly into the veins, weaving together a network
of fire and air like a weel, having at the entrance two lesser weels;
further he constructed one of these with two openings, and from the
lesser weels he extended cords reaching all round to the extremities of
the network. all the interior of the net he made of fire, but the lesser
weels and their cavity, of air. the network he took and spread over the
newly-formed animal in the following manner:--he let the lesser weels
pass into the mouth; there were two of them, and one he let down by the
air-pipes into the lungs, the other by the side of the air-pipes into
the belly. the former he divided into two branches, both of which he
made to meet at the channels of the nose, so that when the way through
the mouth did not act, the streams of the mouth as well were replenished
through the nose. with the other cavity (i.e. of the greater weel) he
enveloped the hollow parts of the body, and at one time he made all this
to flow into the lesser weels, quite gently, for they are composed of
air, and at another time he caused the lesser weels to flow back again;
and the net he made to find a way in and out through the pores of the
body, and the rays of fire which are bound fast within followed the
passage of the air either way, never at any time ceasing so long as the
mortal being holds together. this process, as we affirm, the name-giver
named inspiration and expiration. and all this movement, active as
well as passive, takes place in order that the body, being watered and
cooled, may receive nourishment and life; for when the respiration is
going in and out, and the fire, which is fast bound within, follows
it, and ever and anon moving to and fro, enters through the belly and
reaches the meat and drink, it dissolves them, and dividing them into
small portions and guiding them through the passages where it goes,
pumps them as from a fountain into the channels of the veins, and makes
the stream of the veins flow through the body as through a conduit.

let us once more consider the phenomena of respiration, and enquire into
the causes which have made it what it is. they are as follows:--seeing
that there is no such thing as a vacuum into which any of those things
which are moved can enter, and the breath is carried from us into the
external air, the next point is, as will be clear to every one, that
it does not go into a vacant space, but pushes its neighbour out of its
place, and that which is thrust out in turn drives out its neighbour;
and in this way everything of necessity at last comes round to that
place from whence the breath came forth, and enters in there, and
following the breath, fills up the vacant space; and this goes on like
the rotation of a wheel, because there can be no such thing as a vacuum.
wherefore also the breast and the lungs, when they emit the breath,
are replenished by the air which surrounds the body and which enters
in through the pores of the flesh and is driven round in a circle; and
again, the air which is sent away and passes out through the body forces
the breath inwards through the passage of the mouth and the nostrils.
now the origin of this movement may be supposed to be as follows. in the
interior of every animal the hottest part is that which is around the
blood and veins; it is in a manner an internal fountain of fire, which
we compare to the network of a creel, being woven all of fire and
extended through the centre of the body, while the outer parts are
composed of air. now we must admit that heat naturally proceeds outward
to its own place and to its kindred element; and as there are two exits
for the heat, the one out through the body, and the other through the
mouth and nostrils, when it moves towards the one, it drives round the
air at the other, and that which is driven round falls into the fire
and becomes warm, and that which goes forth is cooled. but when the heat
changes its place, and the particles at the other exit grow warmer, the
hotter air inclining in that direction and carried towards its native
element, fire, pushes round the air at the other; and this being
affected in the same way and communicating the same impulse, a circular
motion swaying to and fro is produced by the double process, which we
call inspiration and expiration.

the phenomena of medical cupping-glasses and of the swallowing of drink
and of the projection of bodies, whether discharged in the air or bowled
along the ground, are to be investigated on a similar principle;
and swift and slow sounds, which appear to be high and low, and are
sometimes discordant on account of their inequality, and then again
harmonical on account of the equality of the motion which they excite in
us. for when the motions of the antecedent swifter sounds begin to pause
and the two are equalized, the slower sounds overtake the swifter and
then propel them. when they overtake them they do not intrude a new
and discordant motion, but introduce the beginnings of a slower, which
answers to the swifter as it dies away, thus producing a single mixed
expression out of high and low, whence arises a pleasure which even the
unwise feel, and which to the wise becomes a higher sort of delight,
being an imitation of divine harmony in mortal motions. moreover, as to
the flowing of water, the fall of the thunderbolt, and the marvels that
are observed about the attraction of amber and the heraclean stones,--in
none of these cases is there any attraction; but he who investigates
rightly, will find that such wonderful phenomena are attributable to the
combination of certain conditions--the non-existence of a vacuum, the
fact that objects push one another round, and that they change places,
passing severally into their proper positions as they are divided or
combined.

such as we have seen, is the nature and such are the causes of
respiration,--the subject in which this discussion originated. for the
fire cuts the food and following the breath surges up within, fire and
breath rising together and filling the veins by drawing up out of the
belly and pouring into them the cut portions of the food; and so the
streams of food are kept flowing through the whole body in all animals.
and fresh cuttings from kindred substances, whether the fruits of the
earth or herb of the field, which god planted to be our daily food,
acquire all sorts of colours by their inter-mixture; but red is the most
pervading of them, being created by the cutting action of fire and by
the impression which it makes on a moist substance; and hence the liquid
which circulates in the body has a colour such as we have described.
the liquid itself we call blood, which nourishes the flesh and the whole
body, whence all parts are watered and empty places filled.

now the process of repletion and evacuation is effected after the
manner of the universal motion by which all kindred substances are drawn
towards one another. for the external elements which surround us are
always causing us to consume away, and distributing and sending off like
to like; the particles of blood, too, which are divided and contained
within the frame of the animal as in a sort of heaven, are compelled
to imitate the motion of the universe. each, therefore, of the divided
parts within us, being carried to its kindred nature, replenishes the
void. when more is taken away than flows in, then we decay, and when
less, we grow and increase.

the frame of the entire creature when young has the triangles of each
kind new, and may be compared to the keel of a vessel which is just off
the stocks; they are locked firmly together and yet the whole mass is
soft and delicate, being freshly formed of marrow and nurtured on milk.
now when the triangles out of which meats and drinks are composed come
in from without, and are comprehended in the body, being older and
weaker than the triangles already there, the frame of the body gets the
better of them and its newer triangles cut them up, and so the animal
grows great, being nourished by a multitude of similar particles. but
when the roots of the triangles are loosened by having undergone many
conflicts with many things in the course of time, they are no longer
able to cut or assimilate the food which enters, but are themselves
easily divided by the bodies which come in from without. in this way
every animal is overcome and decays, and this affection is called old
age. and at last, when the bonds by which the triangles of the marrow
are united no longer hold, and are parted by the strain of existence,
they in turn loosen the bonds of the soul, and she, obtaining a natural
release, flies away with joy. for that which takes place according to
nature is pleasant, but that which is contrary to nature is painful. and
thus death, if caused by disease or produced by wounds, is painful and
violent; but that sort of death which comes with old age and fulfils
the debt of nature is the easiest of deaths, and is accompanied with
pleasure rather than with pain.

now every one can see whence diseases arise. there are four natures out
of which the body is compacted, earth and fire and water and air, and
the unnatural excess or defect of these, or the change of any of them
from its own natural place into another, or--since there are more kinds
than one of fire and of the other elements--the assumption by any of
these of a wrong kind, or any similar irregularity, produces disorders
and diseases; for when any of them is produced or changed in a manner
contrary to nature, the parts which were previously cool grow warm, and
those which were dry become moist, and the light become heavy, and the
heavy light; all sorts of changes occur. for, as we affirm, a thing
can only remain the same with itself, whole and sound, when the same is
added to it, or subtracted from it, in the same respect and in the
same manner and in due proportion; and whatever comes or goes away
in violation of these laws causes all manner of changes and infinite
diseases and corruptions. now there is a second class of structures
which are also natural, and this affords a second opportunity of
observing diseases to him who would understand them. for whereas marrow
and bone and flesh and sinews are composed of the four elements, and the
blood, though after another manner, is likewise formed out of them, most
diseases originate in the way which i have described; but the worst
of all owe their severity to the fact that the generation of these
substances proceeds in a wrong order; they are then destroyed. for the
natural order is that the flesh and sinews should be made of blood, the
sinews out of the fibres to which they are akin, and the flesh out
of the clots which are formed when the fibres are separated. and the
glutinous and rich matter which comes away from the sinews and the
flesh, not only glues the flesh to the bones, but nourishes and imparts
growth to the bone which surrounds the marrow; and by reason of the
solidity of the bones, that which filters through consists of the purest
and smoothest and oiliest sort of triangles, dropping like dew from the
bones and watering the marrow. now when each process takes place in this
order, health commonly results; when in the opposite order, disease. for
when the flesh becomes decomposed and sends back the wasting substance
into the veins, then an over-supply of blood of diverse kinds, mingling
with air in the veins, having variegated colours and bitter properties,
as well as acid and saline qualities, contains all sorts of bile and
serum and phlegm. for all things go the wrong way, and having become
corrupted, first they taint the blood itself, and then ceasing to
give nourishment to the body they are carried along the veins in all
directions, no longer preserving the order of their natural courses, but
at war with themselves, because they receive no good from one another,
and are hostile to the abiding constitution of the body, which they
corrupt and dissolve. the oldest part of the flesh which is corrupted,
being hard to decompose, from long burning grows black, and from being
everywhere corroded becomes bitter, and is injurious to every part of
the body which is still uncorrupted. sometimes, when the bitter element
is refined away, the black part assumes an acidity which takes the place
of the bitterness; at other times the bitterness being tinged with blood
has a redder colour; and this, when mixed with black, takes the hue of
grass; and again, an auburn colour mingles with the bitter matter
when new flesh is decomposed by the fire which surrounds the internal
flame;--to all which symptoms some physician perhaps, or rather some
philosopher, who had the power of seeing in many dissimilar things one
nature deserving of a name, has assigned the common name of bile. but
the other kinds of bile are variously distinguished by their colours. as
for serum, that sort which is the watery part of blood is innocent,
but that which is a secretion of black and acid bile is malignant when
mingled by the power of heat with any salt substance, and is then called
acid phlegm. again, the substance which is formed by the liquefaction
of new and tender flesh when air is present, if inflated and encased in
liquid so as to form bubbles, which separately are invisible owing to
their small size, but when collected are of a bulk which is visible,
and have a white colour arising out of the generation of foam--all this
decomposition of tender flesh when intermingled with air is termed by us
white phlegm. and the whey or sediment of newly-formed phlegm is sweat
and tears, and includes the various daily discharges by which the body
is purified. now all these become causes of disease when the blood is
not replenished in a natural manner by food and drink but gains bulk
from opposite sources in violation of the laws of nature. when the
several parts of the flesh are separated by disease, if the foundation
remains, the power of the disorder is only half as great, and there
is still a prospect of an easy recovery; but when that which binds the
flesh to the bones is diseased, and no longer being separated from the
muscles and sinews, ceases to give nourishment to the bone and to unite
flesh and bone, and from being oily and smooth and glutinous becomes
rough and salt and dry, owing to bad regimen, then all the substance
thus corrupted crumbles away under the flesh and the sinews, and
separates from the bone, and the fleshy parts fall away from their
foundation and leave the sinews bare and full of brine, and the
flesh again gets into the circulation of the blood and makes the
previously-mentioned disorders still greater. and if these bodily
affections be severe, still worse are the prior disorders; as when the
bone itself, by reason of the density of the flesh, does not obtain
sufficient air, but becomes mouldy and hot and gangrened and receives no
nutriment, and the natural process is inverted, and the bone crumbling
passes into the food, and the food into the flesh, and the flesh again
falling into the blood makes all maladies that may occur more virulent
than those already mentioned. but the worst case of all is when the
marrow is diseased, either from excess or defect; and this is the cause
of the very greatest and most fatal disorders, in which the whole course
of the body is reversed.

there is a third class of diseases which may be conceived of as arising
in three ways; for they are produced sometimes by wind, and sometimes by
phlegm, and sometimes by bile. when the lung, which is the dispenser of
the air to the body, is obstructed by rheums and its passages are not
free, some of them not acting, while through others too much air enters,
then the parts which are unrefreshed by air corrode, while in other
parts the excess of air forcing its way through the veins distorts them
and decomposing the body is enclosed in the midst of it and occupies the
midriff; thus numberless painful diseases are produced, accompanied by
copious sweats. and oftentimes when the flesh is dissolved in the body,
wind, generated within and unable to escape, is the source of quite as
much pain as the air coming in from without; but the greatest pain is
felt when the wind gets about the sinews and the veins of the shoulders,
and swells them up, and so twists back the great tendons and the sinews
which are connected with them. these disorders are called tetanus and
opisthotonus, by reason of the tension which accompanies them. the
cure of them is difficult; relief is in most cases given by fever
supervening. the white phlegm, though dangerous when detained within by
reason of the air-bubbles, yet if it can communicate with the outside
air, is less severe, and only discolours the body, generating leprous
eruptions and similar diseases. when it is mingled with black bile and
dispersed about the courses of the head, which are the divinest part
of us, the attack if coming on in sleep, is not so severe; but when
assailing those who are awake it is hard to be got rid of, and being an
affection of a sacred part, is most justly called sacred. an acid and
salt phlegm, again, is the source of all those diseases which take the
form of catarrh, but they have many names because the places into which
they flow are manifold.

inflammations of the body come from burnings and inflamings, and all of
them originate in bile. when bile finds a means of discharge, it boils
up and sends forth all sorts of tumours; but when imprisoned within, it
generates many inflammatory diseases, above all when mingled with pure
blood; since it then displaces the fibres which are scattered about in
the blood and are designed to maintain the balance of rare and dense,
in order that the blood may not be so liquefied by heat as to exude
from the pores of the body, nor again become too dense and thus find
a difficulty in circulating through the veins. the fibres are so
constituted as to maintain this balance; and if any one brings them
all together when the blood is dead and in process of cooling, then the
blood which remains becomes fluid, but if they are left alone, they soon
congeal by reason of the surrounding cold. the fibres having this power
over the blood, bile, which is only stale blood, and which from being
flesh is dissolved again into blood, at the first influx coming in
little by little, hot and liquid, is congealed by the power of the
fibres; and so congealing and made to cool, it produces internal cold
and shuddering. when it enters with more of a flood and overcomes the
fibres by its heat, and boiling up throws them into disorder, if it have
power enough to maintain its supremacy, it penetrates the marrow and
burns up what may be termed the cables of the soul, and sets her free;
but when there is not so much of it, and the body though wasted still
holds out, the bile is itself mastered, and is either utterly banished,
or is thrust through the veins into the lower or upper belly, and is
driven out of the body like an exile from a state in which there has
been civil war; whence arise diarrhoeas and dysenteries, and all such
disorders. when the constitution is disordered by excess of fire,
continuous heat and fever are the result; when excess of air is the
cause, then the fever is quotidian; when of water, which is a more
sluggish element than either fire or air, then the fever is a tertian;
when of earth, which is the most sluggish of the four, and is only
purged away in a four-fold period, the result is a quartan fever, which
can with difficulty be shaken off.

such is the manner in which diseases of the body arise; the disorders
of the soul, which depend upon the body, originate as follows. we must
acknowledge disease of the mind to be a want of intelligence; and of
this there are two kinds; to wit, madness and ignorance. in whatever
state a man experiences either of them, that state may be called
disease; and excessive pains and pleasures are justly to be regarded as
the greatest diseases to which the soul is liable. for a man who is in
great joy or in great pain, in his unreasonable eagerness to attain
the one and to avoid the other, is not able to see or to hear anything
rightly; but he is mad, and is at the time utterly incapable of any
participation in reason. he who has the seed about the spinal marrow too
plentiful and overflowing, like a tree overladen with fruit, has
many throes, and also obtains many pleasures in his desires and their
offspring, and is for the most part of his life deranged, because his
pleasures and pains are so very great; his soul is rendered foolish and
disordered by his body; yet he is regarded not as one diseased, but as
one who is voluntarily bad, which is a mistake. the truth is that
the intemperance of love is a disease of the soul due chiefly to the
moisture and fluidity which is produced in one of the elements by the
loose consistency of the bones. and in general, all that which is termed
the incontinence of pleasure and is deemed a reproach under the
idea that the wicked voluntarily do wrong is not justly a matter for
reproach. for no man is voluntarily bad; but the bad become bad by
reason of an ill disposition of the body and bad education, things which
are hateful to every man and happen to him against his will. and in
the case of pain too in like manner the soul suffers much evil from the
body. for where the acid and briny phlegm and other bitter and bilious
humours wander about in the body, and find no exit or escape, but are
pent up within and mingle their own vapours with the motions of the
soul, and are blended with them, they produce all sorts of diseases,
more or fewer, and in every degree of intensity; and being carried to
the three places of the soul, whichever they may severally assail, they
create infinite varieties of ill-temper and melancholy, of rashness and
cowardice, and also of forgetfulness and stupidity. further, when to
this evil constitution of body evil forms of government are added and
evil discourses are uttered in private as well as in public, and no sort
of instruction is given in youth to cure these evils, then all of us
who are bad become bad from two causes which are entirely beyond our
control. in such cases the planters are to blame rather than the plants,
the educators rather than the educated. but however that may be,
we should endeavour as far as we can by education, and studies, and
learning, to avoid vice and attain virtue; this, however, is part of
another subject.

there is a corresponding enquiry concerning the mode of treatment by
which the mind and the body are to be preserved, about which it is meet
and right that i should say a word in turn; for it is more our duty to
speak of the good than of the evil. everything that is good is fair, and
the fair is not without proportion, and the animal which is to be
fair must have due proportion. now we perceive lesser symmetries or
proportions and reason about them, but of the highest and greatest
we take no heed; for there is no proportion or disproportion more
productive of health and disease, and virtue and vice, than that between
soul and body. this however we do not perceive, nor do we reflect that
when a weak or small frame is the vehicle of a great and mighty soul,
or conversely, when a little soul is encased in a large body, then
the whole animal is not fair, for it lacks the most important of all
symmetries; but the due proportion of mind and body is the fairest and
loveliest of all sights to him who has the seeing eye. just as a body
which has a leg too long, or which is unsymmetrical in some other
respect, is an unpleasant sight, and also, when doing its share of work,
is much distressed and makes convulsive efforts, and often stumbles
through awkwardness, and is the cause of infinite evil to its own
self--in like manner we should conceive of the double nature which we
call the living being; and when in this compound there is an impassioned
soul more powerful than the body, that soul, i say, convulses and fills
with disorders the whole inner nature of man; and when eager in the
pursuit of some sort of learning or study, causes wasting; or again,
when teaching or disputing in private or in public, and strifes and
controversies arise, inflames and dissolves the composite frame of
man and introduces rheums; and the nature of this phenomenon is not
understood by most professors of medicine, who ascribe it to the
opposite of the real cause. and once more, when a body large and too
strong for the soul is united to a small and weak intelligence, then
inasmuch as there are two desires natural to man,--one of food for the
sake of the body, and one of wisdom for the sake of the diviner part
of us--then, i say, the motions of the stronger, getting the better and
increasing their own power, but making the soul dull, and stupid, and
forgetful, engender ignorance, which is the greatest of diseases. there
is one protection against both kinds of disproportion:--that we should
not move the body without the soul or the soul without the body, and
thus they will be on their guard against each other, and be healthy and
well balanced. and therefore the mathematician or any one else whose
thoughts are much absorbed in some intellectual pursuit, must allow his
body also to have due exercise, and practise gymnastic; and he who
is careful to fashion the body, should in turn impart to the soul its
proper motions, and should cultivate music and all philosophy, if he
would deserve to be called truly fair and truly good. and the separate
parts should be treated in the same manner, in imitation of the pattern
of the universe; for as the body is heated and also cooled within by
the elements which enter into it, and is again dried up and moistened by
external things, and experiences these and the like affections from both
kinds of motions, the result is that the body if given up to motion when
in a state of quiescence is overmastered and perishes; but if any one,
in imitation of that which we call the foster-mother and nurse of the
universe, will not allow the body ever to be inactive, but is always
producing motions and agitations through its whole extent, which form
the natural defence against other motions both internal and external,
and by moderate exercise reduces to order according to their affinities
the particles and affections which are wandering about the body, as we
have already said when speaking of the universe, he will not allow enemy
placed by the side of enemy to stir up wars and disorders in the body,
but he will place friend by the side of friend, so as to create health.
now of all motions that is the best which is produced in a thing
by itself, for it is most akin to the motion of thought and of the
universe; but that motion which is caused by others is not so good, and
worst of all is that which moves the body, when at rest, in parts only
and by some external agency. wherefore of all modes of purifying and
re-uniting the body the best is gymnastic; the next best is a surging
motion, as in sailing or any other mode of conveyance which is not
fatiguing; the third sort of motion may be of use in a case of extreme
necessity, but in any other will be adopted by no man of sense: i mean
the purgative treatment of physicians; for diseases unless they are
very dangerous should not be irritated by medicines, since every form of
disease is in a manner akin to the living being, whose complex frame
has an appointed term of life. for not the whole race only, but each
individual--barring inevitable accidents--comes into the world having a
fixed span, and the triangles in us are originally framed with power to
last for a certain time, beyond which no man can prolong his life. and
this holds also of the constitution of diseases; if any one regardless
of the appointed time tries to subdue them by medicine, he only
aggravates and multiplies them. wherefore we ought always to manage
them by regimen, as far as a man can spare the time, and not provoke a
disagreeable enemy by medicines.

enough of the composite animal, and of the body which is a part of him,
and of the manner in which a man may train and be trained by himself so
as to live most according to reason: and we must above and before all
provide that the element which is to train him shall be the fairest and
best adapted to that purpose. a minute discussion of this subject would
be a serious task; but if, as before, i am to give only an outline, the
subject may not unfitly be summed up as follows.

i have often remarked that there are three kinds of soul located within
us, having each of them motions, and i must now repeat in the fewest
words possible, that one part, if remaining inactive and ceasing from
its natural motion, must necessarily become very weak, but that which is
trained and exercised, very strong. wherefore we should take care
that the movements of the different parts of the soul should be in due
proportion.

and we should consider that god gave the sovereign part of the human
soul to be the divinity of each one, being that part which, as we say,
dwells at the top of the body, and inasmuch as we are a plant not of an
earthly but of a heavenly growth, raises us from earth to our kindred
who are in heaven. and in this we say truly; for the divine power
suspended the head and root of us from that place where the generation
of the soul first began, and thus made the whole body upright. when a
man is always occupied with the cravings of desire and ambition, and is
eagerly striving to satisfy them, all his thoughts must be mortal, and,
as far as it is possible altogether to become such, he must be mortal
every whit, because he has cherished his mortal part. but he who has
been earnest in the love of knowledge and of true wisdom, and has
exercised his intellect more than any other part of him, must have
thoughts immortal and divine, if he attain truth, and in so far as
human nature is capable of sharing in immortality, he must altogether be
immortal; and since he is ever cherishing the divine power, and has the
divinity within him in perfect order, he will be perfectly happy. now
there is only one way of taking care of things, and this is to give to
each the food and motion which are natural to it. and the motions which
are naturally akin to the divine principle within us are the thoughts
and revolutions of the universe. these each man should follow, and
correct the courses of the head which were corrupted at our birth,
and by learning the harmonies and revolutions of the universe, should
assimilate the thinking being to the thought, renewing his original
nature, and having assimilated them should attain to that perfect life
which the gods have set before mankind, both for the present and the
future.

thus our original design of discoursing about the universe down to the
creation of man is nearly completed. a brief mention may be made of the
generation of other animals, so far as the subject admits of brevity;
in this manner our argument will best attain a due proportion. on the
subject of animals, then, the following remarks may be offered. of the
men who came into the world, those who were cowards or led unrighteous
lives may with reason be supposed to have changed into the nature of
women in the second generation. and this was the reason why at that time
the gods created in us the desire of sexual intercourse, contriving
in man one animated substance, and in woman another, which they formed
respectively in the following manner. the outlet for drink by which
liquids pass through the lung under the kidneys and into the bladder,
which receives and then by the pressure of the air emits them, was so
fashioned by them as to penetrate also into the body of the marrow,
which passes from the head along the neck and through the back, and
which in the preceding discourse we have named the seed. and the seed
having life, and becoming endowed with respiration, produces in that
part in which it respires a lively desire of emission, and thus creates
in us the love of procreation. wherefore also in men the organ of
generation becoming rebellious and masterful, like an animal disobedient
to reason, and maddened with the sting of lust, seeks to gain absolute
sway; and the same is the case with the so-called womb or matrix of
women; the animal within them is desirous of procreating children, and
when remaining unfruitful long beyond its proper time, gets discontented
and angry, and wandering in every direction through the body, closes up
the passages of the breath, and, by obstructing respiration, drives
them to extremity, causing all varieties of disease, until at length the
desire and love of the man and the woman, bringing them together and
as it were plucking the fruit from the tree, sow in the womb, as in a
field, animals unseen by reason of their smallness and without form;
these again are separated and matured within; they are then finally
brought out into the light, and thus the generation of animals is
completed.

thus were created women and the female sex in general. but the race of
birds was created out of innocent light-minded men, who, although their
minds were directed toward heaven, imagined, in their simplicity, that
the clearest demonstration of the things above was to be obtained by
sight; these were remodelled and transformed into birds, and they grew
feathers instead of hair. the race of wild pedestrian animals, again,
came from those who had no philosophy in any of their thoughts, and
never considered at all about the nature of the heavens, because they
had ceased to use the courses of the head, but followed the guidance of
those parts of the soul which are in the breast. in consequence of these
habits of theirs they had their front-legs and their heads resting upon
the earth to which they were drawn by natural affinity; and the crowns
of their heads were elongated and of all sorts of shapes, into which the
courses of the soul were crushed by reason of disuse. and this was the
reason why they were created quadrupeds and polypods: god gave the more
senseless of them the more support that they might be more attracted to
the earth. and the most foolish of them, who trail their bodies entirely
upon the ground and have no longer any need of feet, he made without
feet to crawl upon the earth. the fourth class were the inhabitants
of the water: these were made out of the most entirely senseless and
ignorant of all, whom the transformers did not think any longer worthy
of pure respiration, because they possessed a soul which was made impure
by all sorts of transgression; and instead of the subtle and pure medium
of air, they gave them the deep and muddy sea to be their element of
respiration; and hence arose the race of fishes and oysters, and other
aquatic animals, which have received the most remote habitations as a
punishment of their outlandish ignorance. these are the laws by which
animals pass into one another, now, as ever, changing as they lose or
gain wisdom and folly.

we may now say that our discourse about the nature of the universe has
an end. the world has received animals, mortal and immortal, and is
fulfilled with them, and has become a visible animal containing the
visible--the sensible god who is the image of the intellectual, the
greatest, best, fairest, most perfect--the one only-begotten heaven.

introduction and analysis.

the genuineness of the laws is sufficiently proved (1) by more than
twenty citations of them in the writings of aristotle, who was residing
at athens during the last twenty years of the life of plato, and who,
having left it after his death (b.c. 347), returned thither twelve years
later (b.c. 335); (2) by the allusion of isocrates

(oratio ad philippum missa, p.84: to men tais paneguresin enochlein
kai pros apantas legein tous sunprechontas en autais pros oudena legein
estin, all omoios oi toioutoi ton logon (sc. speeches in the assembly)
akuroi tugchanousin ontes tois nomois kai tais politeiais tais upo ton
sophiston gegrammenais.) --writing 346 b.c., a year after the death
of plato, and probably not more than three or four years after the
composition of the laws--who speaks of the laws and republics written by
philosophers (upo ton sophiston); (3) by the reference (athen.) of the
comic poet alexis, a younger contemporary of plato (fl. b.c 356-306), to
the enactment about prices, which occurs in laws xi., viz that the same
goods should not be offered at two prices on the same day

     (ou gegone kreitton nomothetes tou plousiou

     saprous apantas apopherosin oikade.

meineke, frag. com. graec.); (4) by the unanimous voice of later
antiquity and the absence of any suspicion among ancient writers worth
speaking of to the contrary; for it is not said of philippus of opus
that he composed any part of the laws, but only that he copied them
out of the waxen tablets, and was thought by some to have written the
epinomis (diog. laert.) that the longest and one of the best writings
bearing the name of plato should be a forgery, even if its genuineness
were unsupported by external testimony, would be a singular phenomenon
in ancient literature; and although the critical worth of the consensus
of late writers is generally not to be compared with the express
testimony of contemporaries, yet a somewhat greater value may be
attributed to their consent in the present instance, because the
admission of the laws is combined with doubts about the epinomis,
a spurious writing, which is a kind of epilogue to the larger work
probably of a much later date. this shows that the reception of the laws
was not altogether undiscriminating.

the suspicion which has attached to the laws of plato in the judgment
of some modern writers appears to rest partly (1) on differences in
the style and form of the work, and (2) on differences of thought and
opinion which they observe in them. their suspicion is increased by the
fact that these differences are accompanied by resemblances as striking
to passages in other platonic writings. they are sensible of a want
of point in the dialogue and a general inferiority in the ideas,
plan, manners, and style. they miss the poetical flow, the dramatic
verisimilitude, the life and variety of the characters, the dialectic
subtlety, the attic purity, the luminous order, the exquisite urbanity;
instead of which they find tautology, obscurity, self-sufficiency,
sermonizing, rhetorical declamation, pedantry, egotism, uncouth forms
of sentences, and peculiarities in the use of words and idioms. they are
unable to discover any unity in the patched, irregular structure. the
speculative element both in government and education is superseded by
a narrow economical or religious vein. the grace and cheerfulness of
athenian life have disappeared; and a spirit of moroseness and religious
intolerance has taken their place. the charm of youth is no longer
there; the mannerism of age makes itself unpleasantly felt. the
connection is often imperfect; and there is a want of arrangement,
exhibited especially in the enumeration of the laws towards the end of
the work. the laws are full of flaws and repetitions. the greek is in
places very ungrammatical and intractable. a cynical levity is displayed
in some passages, and a tone of disappointment and lamentation over
human things in others. the critics seem also to observe in them bad
imitations of thoughts which are better expressed in plato's other
writings. lastly, they wonder how the mind which conceived the republic
could have left the critias, hermocrates, and philosophus incomplete or
unwritten, and have devoted the last years of life to the laws.

the questions which have been thus indirectly suggested may be
considered by us under five or six heads: i, the characters; ii, the
plan; iii, the style; iv, the imitations of other writings of plato;
v; the more general relation of the laws to the republic and the other
dialogues; and vi, to the existing athenian and spartan states.

i. already in the philebus the distinctive character of socrates has
disappeared; and in the timaeus, sophist, and statesman his function of
chief speaker is handed over to the pythagorean philosopher timaeus, and
to the eleatic stranger, at whose feet he sits, and is silent. more and
more plato seems to have felt in his later writings that the character
and method of socrates were no longer suited to be the vehicle of his
own philosophy. he is no longer interrogative but dogmatic; not 'a
hesitating enquirer,' but one who speaks with the authority of a
legislator. even in the republic we have seen that the argument which is
carried on by socrates in the old style with thrasymachus in the first
book, soon passes into the form of exposition. in the laws he is nowhere
mentioned. yet so completely in the tradition of antiquity is socrates
identified with plato, that in the criticism of the laws which we find
in the so-called politics of aristotle he is supposed by the writer
still to be playing his part of the chief speaker (compare pol.).

the laws are discussed by three representatives of athens, crete, and
sparta. the athenian, as might be expected, is the protagonist or chief
speaker, while the second place is assigned to the cretan, who, as
one of the leaders of a new colony, has a special interest in the
conversation. at least four-fifths of the answers are put into his
mouth. the spartan is every inch a soldier, a man of few words himself,
better at deeds than words. the athenian talks to the two others,
although they are his equals in age, in the style of a master
discoursing to his scholars; he frequently praises himself; he
entertains a very poor opinion of the understanding of his companions.
certainly the boastfulness and rudeness of the laws is the reverse of
the refined irony and courtesy which characterize the earlier dialogues.
we are no longer in such good company as in the phaedrus and symposium.
manners are lost sight of in the earnestness of the speakers, and
dogmatic assertions take the place of poetical fancies.

the scene is laid in crete, and the conversation is held in the course
of a walk from cnosus to the cave and temple of zeus, which takes place
on one of the longest and hottest days of the year. the companions start
at dawn, and arrive at the point in their conversation which terminates
the fourth book, about noon. the god to whose temple they are going is
the lawgiver of crete, and this may be supposed to be the very cave
at which he gave his oracles to minos. but the externals of the scene,
which are briefly and inartistically described, soon disappear, and we
plunge abruptly into the subject of the dialogue. we are reminded by
contrast of the higher art of the phaedrus, in which the summer's day,
and the cool stream, and the chirping of the grasshoppers, and the
fragrance of the agnus castus, and the legends of the place are present
to the imagination throughout the discourse.

the typical athenian apologizes for the tendency of his countrymen
'to spin a long discussion out of slender materials,' and in a similar
spirit the lacedaemonian megillus apologizes for the spartan brevity
(compare thucydid.), acknowledging at the same time that there may be
occasions when long discourses are necessary. the family of megillus is
the proxenus of athens at sparta; and he pays a beautiful compliment to
the athenian, significant of the character of the work, which, though
borrowing many elements from sparta, is also pervaded by an athenian
spirit. a good athenian, he says, is more than ordinarily good, because
he is inspired by nature and not manufactured by law. the love of
listening which is attributed to the timocrat in the republic is also
exhibited in him. the athenian on his side has a pleasure in speaking to
the lacedaemonian of the struggle in which their ancestors were jointly
engaged against the persians. a connexion with athens is likewise
intimated by the cretan cleinias. he is the relative of epimenides,
whom, by an anachronism of a century,--perhaps arising as zeller
suggests (plat. stud.) out of a confusion of the visit of epimenides
and diotima (symp.),--he describes as coming to athens, not after the
attempt of cylon, but ten years before the persian war. the cretan and
lacedaemonian hardly contribute at all to the argument of which the
athenian is the expounder; they only supply information when asked about
the institutions of their respective countries. a kind of simplicity or
stupidity is ascribed to them. at first, they are dissatisfied with the
free criticisms which the athenian passes upon the laws of minos and
lycurgus, but they acquiesce in his greater experience and knowledge of
the world. they admit that there can be no objection to the enquiry; for
in the spirit of the legislator himself, they are discussing his laws
when there are no young men present to listen. they are unwilling to
allow that the spartan and cretan lawgivers can have been mistaken
in honouring courage as the first part of virtue, and are puzzled at
hearing for the first time that 'goods are only evil to the evil.'
several times they are on the point of quarrelling, and by an effort
learn to restrain their natural feeling (compare shakespeare, henry v,
act iii. sc. 2). in book vii., the lacedaemonian expresses a momentary
irritation at the accusation which the athenian brings against the
spartan institutions, of encouraging licentiousness in their women,
but he is reminded by the cretan that the permission to criticize them
freely has been given, and cannot be retracted. his only criterion of
truth is the authority of the spartan lawgiver; he is 'interested,'
in the novel speculations of the athenian, but inclines to prefer the
ordinances of lycurgus.

the three interlocutors all of them speak in the character of old
men, which forms a pleasant bond of union between them. they have the
feelings of old age about youth, about the state, about human things in
general. nothing in life seems to be of much importance to them; they
are spectators rather than actors, and men in general appear to the
athenian speaker to be the playthings of the gods and of circumstances.
still they have a fatherly care of the young, and are deeply impressed
by sentiments of religion. they would give confidence to the aged by an
increasing use of wine, which, as they get older, is to unloose their
tongues and make them sing. the prospect of the existence of the soul
after death is constantly present to them; though they can hardly be
said to have the cheerful hope and resignation which animates socrates
in the phaedo or cephalus in the republic. plato appears to be
expressing his own feelings in remarks of this sort. for at the time of
writing the first book of the laws he was at least seventy-four years of
age, if we suppose him to allude to the victory of the syracusans under
dionysius the younger over the locrians, which occurred in the year 356.
such a sadness was the natural effect of declining years and failing
powers, which make men ask, 'after all, what profit is there in life?'
they feel that their work is beginning to be over, and are ready to say,
'all the world is a stage;' or, in the actual words of plato, 'let us
play as good plays as we can,' though 'we must be sometimes serious,
which is not agreeable, but necessary.' these are feelings which have
crossed the minds of reflective persons in all ages, and there is no
reason to connect the laws any more than other parts of plato's writings
with the very uncertain narrative of his life, or to imagine that this
melancholy tone is attributable to disappointment at having failed to
convert a sicilian tyrant into a philosopher.

ii. the plan of the laws is more irregular and has less connexion than
any other of the writings of plato. as aristotle says in the politics,
'the greater part consists of laws'; in books v, vi, xi, xii the
dialogue almost entirely disappears. large portions of them are rather
the materials for a work than a finished composition which may rank with
the other platonic dialogues. to use his own image, 'some stones are
regularly inserted in the building; others are lying on the ground ready
for use.' there is probably truth in the tradition that the laws were
not published until after the death of plato. we can easily believe that
he has left imperfections, which would have been removed if he had
lived a few years longer. the arrangement might have been improved;
the connexion of the argument might have been made plainer, and the
sentences more accurately framed. something also may be attributed
to the feebleness of old age. even a rough sketch of the phaedrus or
symposium would have had a very different look. there is, however, an
interest in possessing one writing of plato which is in the process of
creation.

we must endeavour to find a thread of order which will carry us through
this comparative disorder. the first four books are described by plato
himself as the preface or preamble. having arrived at the conclusion
that each law should have a preamble, the lucky thought occurs to him at
the end of the fourth book that the preceding discourse is the
preamble of the whole. this preamble or introduction may be abridged as
follows:--

the institutions of sparta and crete are admitted by the lacedaemonian
and cretan to have one aim only: they were intended by the legislator
to inspire courage in war. to this the athenian objects that the true
lawgiver should frame his laws with a view to all the virtues and not
to one only. better is he who has temperance as well as courage, than he
who has courage only; better is he who is faithful in civil broils,
than he who is a good soldier only. better, too, is peace than war; the
reconciliation than the defeat of an enemy. and he who would attain all
virtue should be trained amid pleasures as well as pains. hence
there should be convivial intercourse among the citizens, and a man's
temperance should be tested in his cups, as we test his courage amid
dangers. he should have a fear of the right sort, as well as a courage
of the right sort.

at the beginning of the second book the subject of pleasure leads to
education, which in the early years of life is wholly a discipline
imparted by the means of pleasure and pain. the discipline of pleasure
is implanted chiefly by the practice of the song and the dance. of
these the forms should be fixed, and not allowed to depend on the fickle
breath of the multitude. there will be choruses of boys, girls, and
grown-up persons, and all will be heard repeating the same strain, that
'virtue is happiness.' one of them will give the law to the rest; this
will be the chorus of aged minstrels, who will sing the most beautiful
and the most useful of songs. they will require a little wine, to mellow
the austerity of age, and make them amenable to the laws.

after having laid down as the first principle of politics, that peace,
and not war, is the true aim of the legislator, and briefly discussed
music and festive intercourse, at the commencement of the third book
plato makes a digression, in which he speaks of the origin of society.
he describes, first of all, the family; secondly, the patriarchal stage,
which is an aggregation of families; thirdly, the founding of regular
cities, like ilium; fourthly, the establishment of a military and
political system, like that of sparta, with which he identifies argos
and messene, dating from the return of the heraclidae. but the aims of
states should be good, or else, like the prayer of theseus, they may
be ruinous to themselves. this was the case in two out of three of the
heracleid kingdoms. they did not understand that the powers in a state
should be balanced. the balance of powers saved sparta, while the excess
of tyranny in persia and the excess of liberty at athens have been the
ruin of both...this discourse on politics is suddenly discovered to have
an immediate practical use; for cleinias the cretan is about to give
laws to a new colony.

at the beginning of the fourth book, after enquiring into the
circumstances and situation of the colony, the athenian proceeds to make
further reflections. chance, and god, and the skill of the legislator,
all co-operate in the formation of states. and the most favourable
condition for the foundation of a new one is when the government is
in the hands of a virtuous tyrant who has the good fortune to be
the contemporary of a great legislator. but a virtuous tyrant is a
contradiction in terms; we can at best only hope to have magistrates who
are the servants of reason and the law. this leads to the enquiry, what
is to be the polity of our new state. and the answer is, that we are to
fear god, and honour our parents, and to cultivate virtue and justice;
these are to be our first principles. laws must be definite, and
we should create in the citizens a predisposition to obey them. the
legislator will teach as well as command; and with this view he will
prefix preambles to his principal laws.

the fifth book commences in a sort of dithyramb with another and higher
preamble about the honour due to the soul, whence are deduced the duties
of a man to his parents and his friends, to the suppliant and stranger.
he should be true and just, free from envy and excess of all sorts,
forgiving to crimes which are not incurable and are partly involuntary;
and he should have a true taste. the noblest life has the greatest
pleasures and the fewest pains...having finished the preamble, and
touched on some other preliminary considerations, we proceed to the
laws, beginning with the constitution of the state. this is not the best
or ideal state, having all things common, but only the second-best,
in which the land and houses are to be distributed among 5040 citizens
divided into four classes. there is to be no gold or silver among
them, and they are to have moderate wealth, and to respect number and
numerical order in all things.

in the first part of the sixth book, plato completes his sketch of the
constitution by the appointment of officers. he explains the manner
in which guardians of the law, generals, priests, wardens of town
and country, ministers of education, and other magistrates are to be
appointed; and also in what way courts of appeal are to be constituted,
and omissions in the law to be supplied. next--and at this point
the laws strictly speaking begin--there follow enactments respecting
marriage and the procreation of children, respecting property in slaves
as well as of other kinds, respecting houses, married life, common
tables for men and women. the question of age in marriage suggests the
consideration of a similar question about the time for holding offices,
and for military service, which had been previously omitted.

resuming the order of the discussion, which was indicated in the
previous book, from marriage and birth we proceed to education in the
seventh book. education is to begin at or rather before birth; to be
continued for a time by mothers and nurses under the supervision of
the state; finally, to comprehend music and gymnastics. under music is
included reading, writing, playing on the lyre, arithmetic, geometry,
and a knowledge of astronomy sufficient to preserve the minds of the
citizens from impiety in after-life. gymnastics are to be practised
chiefly with a view to their use in war. the discussion of education,
which was lightly touched upon in book ii, is here completed.

the eighth book contains regulations for civil life, beginning with
festivals, games, and contests, military exercises and the like. on such
occasions plato seems to see young men and maidens meeting together,
and hence he is led into discussing the relations of the sexes, the evil
consequences which arise out of the indulgence of the passions, and the
remedies for them. then he proceeds to speak of agriculture, of arts and
trades, of buying and selling, and of foreign commerce.

the remaining books of the laws, ix-xii, are chiefly concerned with
criminal offences. in the first class are placed offences against the
gods, especially sacrilege or robbery of temples: next follow offences
against the state,--conspiracy, treason, theft. the mention of thefts
suggests a distinction between voluntary and involuntary, curable and
incurable offences. proceeding to the greater crime of homicide, plato
distinguishes between mere homicide, manslaughter, which is partly
voluntary and partly involuntary, and murder, which arises from avarice,
ambition, fear. he also enumerates murders by kindred, murders by
slaves, wounds with or without intent to kill, wounds inflicted in
anger, crimes of or against slaves, insults to parents. to these,
various modes of purification or degrees of punishment are assigned, and
the terrors of another world are also invoked against them.

at the beginning of book x, all acts of violence, including sacrilege,
are summed up in a single law. the law is preceded by an admonition, in
which the offenders are informed that no one ever did an unholy act or
said an unlawful word while he retained his belief in the existence of
the gods; but either he denied their existence, or he believed that they
took no care of man, or that they might be turned from their course
by sacrifices and prayers. the remainder of the book is devoted to the
refutation of these three classes of unbelievers, and concludes with the
means to be taken for their reformation, and the announcement of their
punishments if they continue obstinate and impenitent.

the eleventh book is taken up with laws and with admonitions relating to
individuals, which follow one another without any exact order. there are
laws concerning deposits and the finding of treasure; concerning slaves
and freedmen; concerning retail trade, bequests, divorces, enchantments,
poisonings, magical arts, and the like. in the twelfth book the same
subjects are continued. laws are passed concerning violations of
military discipline, concerning the high office of the examiners and
their burial; concerning oaths and the violation of them, and the
punishments of those who neglect their duties as citizens. foreign
travel is then discussed, and the permission to be accorded to citizens
of journeying in foreign parts; the strangers who may come to visit
the city are also spoken of, and the manner in which they are to be
received. laws are added respecting sureties, searches for property,
right of possession by prescription, abduction of witnesses, theatrical
competition, waging of private warfare, and bribery in offices. rules
are laid down respecting taxation, respecting economy in sacred rites,
respecting judges, their duties and sentences, and respecting sepulchral
places and ceremonies. here the laws end. lastly, a nocturnal council
is instituted for the preservation of the state, consisting of older and
younger members, who are to exhibit in their lives that virtue which is
the basis of the state, to know the one in many, and to be educated
in divine and every other kind of knowledge which will enable them to
fulfil their office.

iii. the style of the laws differs in several important respects from
that of the other dialogues of plato: (1) in the want of character,
power, and lively illustration; (2) in the frequency of mannerisms
(compare introduction to the philebus); (3) in the form and rhythm of
the sentences; (4) in the use of words. on the other hand, there are
many passages (5) which are characterized by a sort of ethical grandeur;
and (6) in which, perhaps, a greater insight into human nature, and a
greater reach of practical wisdom is shown, than in any other of plato's
writings.

1. the discourse of the three old men is described by themselves as an
old man's game of play. yet there is little of the liveliness of a game
in their mode of treating the subject. they do not throw the ball to
and fro, but two out of the three are listeners to the third, who is
constantly asserting his superior wisdom and opportunities of knowledge,
and apologizing (not without reason) for his own want of clearness of
speech. he will 'carry them over the stream;' he will answer for them
when the argument is beyond their comprehension; he is afraid of their
ignorance of mathematics, and thinks that gymnastic is likely to be more
intelligible to them;--he has repeated his words several times, and yet
they cannot understand him. the subject did not properly take the form
of dialogue, and also the literary vigour of plato had passed away. the
old men speak as they might be expected to speak, and in this there is
a touch of dramatic truth. plato has given the laws that form or want of
form which indicates the failure of natural power. there is no regular
plan--none of that consciousness of what has preceded and what is to
follow, which makes a perfect style,--but there are several attempts
at a plan; the argument is 'pulled up,' and frequent explanations are
offered why a particular topic was introduced.

the fictions of the laws have no longer the verisimilitude which
is characteristic of the phaedrus and the timaeus, or even of the
statesman. we can hardly suppose that an educated athenian would have
placed the visit of epimenides to athens ten years before the
persian war, or have imagined that a war with messene prevented the
lacedaemonians from coming to the rescue of hellas. the narrative of the
origin of the dorian institutions, which are said to have been due to
a fear of the growing power of the assyrians, is a plausible invention,
which may be compared with the tale of the island of atlantis and the
poem of solon, but is not accredited by similar arts of deception.
the other statement that the dorians were achaean exiles assembled
by dorieus, and the assertion that troy was included in the assyrian
empire, have some foundation (compare for the latter point, diod.
sicul.). nor is there anywhere in the laws that lively enargeia, that
vivid mise en scene, which is as characteristic of plato as of some
modern novelists.

the old men are afraid of the ridicule which 'will fall on their heads
more than enough,' and they do not often indulge in a joke. in one
of the few which occur, the book of the laws, if left incomplete, is
compared to a monster wandering about without a head. but we no longer
breathe the atmosphere of humour which pervades the symposium and the
euthydemus, in which we pass within a few sentences from the broadest
aristophanic joke to the subtlest refinement of wit and fancy; instead
of this, in the laws an impression of baldness and feebleness is often
left upon our minds. some of the most amusing descriptions, as, for
example, of children roaring for the first three years of life; or of
the athenians walking into the country with fighting-cocks under their
arms; or of the slave doctor who knocks about his patients finely; and
the gentleman doctor who courteously persuades them; or of the way of
keeping order in the theatre, 'by a hint from a stick,' are narrated
with a commonplace gravity; but where we find this sort of dry humour we
shall not be far wrong in thinking that the writer intended to make us
laugh. the seriousness of age takes the place of the jollity of youth.
life should have holidays and festivals; yet we rebuke ourselves when we
laugh, and take our pleasures sadly. the irony of the earlier dialogues,
of which some traces occur in the tenth book, is replaced by a severity
which hardly condescends to regard human things. 'let us say, if you
please, that man is of some account, but i was speaking of him in
comparison with god.'

the imagery and illustrations are poor in themselves, and are not
assisted by the surrounding phraseology. we have seen how in the
republic, and in the earlier dialogues, figures of speech such as 'the
wave,' 'the drone,' 'the chase,' 'the bride,' appear and reappear at
intervals. notes are struck which are repeated from time to time, as
in a strain of music. there is none of this subtle art in the laws. the
illustrations, such as the two kinds of doctors, 'the three kinds of
funerals,' the fear potion, the puppet, the painter leaving a successor
to restore his picture, the 'person stopping to consider where three
ways meet,' the 'old laws about water of which he will not divert the
course,' can hardly be said to do much credit to plato's invention. the
citations from the poets have lost that fanciful character which gave
them their charm in the earlier dialogues. we are tired of images taken
from the arts of navigation, or archery, or weaving, or painting, or
medicine, or music. yet the comparisons of life to a tragedy, or of
the working of mind to the revolution of the self-moved, or of the aged
parent to the image of a god dwelling in the house, or the reflection
that 'man is made to be the plaything of god, and that this rightly
considered is the best of him,' have great beauty.

2. the clumsiness of the style is exhibited in frequent mannerisms and
repetitions. the perfection of the platonic dialogue consists in the
accuracy with which the question and answer are fitted into one another,
and the regularity with which the steps of the argument succeed one
another. this finish of style is no longer discernible in the laws.
there is a want of variety in the answers; nothing can be drawn out
of the respondents but 'yes' or 'no,' 'true,' 'to be sure,' etc.; the
insipid forms, 'what do you mean?' 'to what are you referring?' are
constantly returning. again and again the speaker is charged, or charges
himself, with obscurity; and he repeats again and again that he will
explain his views more clearly. the process of thought which should
be latent in the mind of the writer appears on the surface. in several
passages the athenian praises himself in the most unblushing manner,
very unlike the irony of the earlier dialogues, as when he declares that
'the laws are a divine work given by some inspiration of the gods,' and
that 'youth should commit them to memory instead of the compositions of
the poets.' the prosopopoeia which is adopted by plato in the protagoras
and other dialogues is repeated until we grow weary of it. the
legislator is always addressing the speakers or the youth of the state,
and the speakers are constantly making addresses to the legislator. a
tendency to a paradoxical manner of statement is also observable. 'we
must have drinking,' 'we must have a virtuous tyrant'--this is too much
for the duller wits of the lacedaemonian and cretan, who at first start
back in surprise. more than in any other writing of plato the tone is
hortatory; the laws are sermons as well as laws; they are considered to
have a religious sanction, and to rest upon a religious sentiment in the
mind of the citizens. the words of the athenian are attributed to the
lacedaemonian and cretan, who are supposed to have made them their own,
after the manner of the earlier dialogues. resumptions of subjects which
have been half disposed of in a previous passage constantly occur: the
arrangement has neither the clearness of art nor the freedom of nature.
irrelevant remarks are made here and there, or illustrations used which
are not properly fitted in. the dialogue is generally weak and laboured,
and is in the later books fairly given up, apparently, because unsuited
to the subject of the work. the long speeches or sermons of the
athenian, often extending over several pages, have never the grace
and harmony which are exhibited in the earlier dialogues. for plato is
incapable of sustained composition; his genius is dramatic rather than
oratorical; he can converse, but he cannot make a speech. even the
timaeus, which is one of his most finished works, is full of abrupt
transitions. there is the same kind of difference between the dialogue
and the continuous discourse of plato as between the narrative and
speeches of thucydides.

3. the perfection of style is variety in unity, freedom, ease,
clearness, the power of saying anything, and of striking any note in the
scale of human feelings without impropriety; and such is the divine gift
of language possessed by plato in the symposium and phaedrus. from this
there are many fallings-off in the laws: first, in the structure of
the sentences, which are rhythmical and monotonous,--the formal and
sophistical manner of the age is superseding the natural genius of
plato: secondly, many of them are of enormous length, and the latter end
often forgets the beginning of them,--they seem never to have received
the second thoughts of the author; either the emphasis is wrongly
placed, or there is a want of point in a clause; or an absolute case
occurs which is not properly separated from the rest of the sentence; or
words are aggregated in a manner which fails to show their relation to
one another; or the connecting particles are omitted at the beginning of
sentences; the uses of the relative and antecedent are more indistinct,
the changes of person and number more frequent, examples of pleonasm,
tautology, and periphrasis, antitheses of positive and negative, false
emphasis, and other affectations, are more numerous than in the other
writings of plato; there is also a more common and sometimes unmeaning
use of qualifying formulae, os epos eipein, kata dunamin, and of double
expressions, pante pantos, oudame oudamos, opos kai ope--these are too
numerous to be attributed to errors in the text; again, there is an
over-curious adjustment of verb and participle, noun and epithet, and
other artificial forms of cadence and expression take the place of
natural variety: thirdly, the absence of metaphorical language is
remarkable--the style is not devoid of ornament, but the ornament is of
a debased rhetorical kind, patched on to instead of growing out of the
subject; there is a great command of words, and a laboured use of
them; forced attempts at metaphor occur in several passages,--e.g.
parocheteuein logois; ta men os tithemena ta d os paratithemena; oinos
kolazomenos upo nephontos eterou theou; the plays on the word nomos =
nou dianome, ode etara: fourthly, there is a foolish extravagance of
language in other passages,--'the swinish ignorance of arithmetic;' 'the
justice and suitableness of the discourse on laws;' over-emphasis; 'best
of greeks,' said of all the greeks, and the like: fifthly, poor and
insipid illustrations are also common: sixthly, we may observe an
excessive use of climax and hyperbole, aischron legein chre pros autous
doulon te kai doulen kai paida kai ei pos oion te olen ten oikian: dokei
touto to epitedeuma kata phusin tas peri ta aphrodisia edonas ou monon
anthropon alla kai therion diephtharkenai.

4. the peculiarities in the use of words which occur in the laws have
been collected by zeller (platonische studien) and stallbaum
(legg.): first, in the use of nouns, such as allodemia, apeniautesis,
glukuthumia, diatheter, thrasuxenia, koros, megalonoia, paidourgia:
secondly, in the use of adjectives, such as aistor, biodotes,
echthodopos, eitheos, chronios, and of adverbs, such as aniditi, anatei,
nepoivei: thirdly, in the use of verbs, such as athurein, aissein
(aixeien eipein), euthemoneisthai, parapodizesthai, sebein, temelein,
tetan. these words however, as stallbaum remarks, are formed according
to analogy, and nearly all of them have the support of some poetical or
other authority.

zeller and stallbaum have also collected forms of words in the laws,
differing from the forms of the same words which occur in other places:
e.g. blabos for blabe, abios for abiotos, acharistos for acharis,
douleios for doulikos, paidelos for paidikos, exagrio for exagriaino,
ileoumai for ilaskomai, and the ionic word sophronistus, meaning
'correction.' zeller has noted a fondness for substantives ending in
-ma and -sis, such as georgema, diapauma, epithumema, zemioma, komodema,
omilema; blapsis, loidoresis, paraggelsis, and others; also a use
of substantives in the plural, which are commonly found only in the
singular, maniai, atheotetes, phthonoi, phoboi, phuseis; also, a
peculiar use of prepositions in composition, as in eneirgo, apoblapto,
dianomotheteo, dieiretai, dieulabeisthai, and other words; also, a
frequent occurrence of the ionic datives plural in -aisi and -oisi,
perhaps used for the sake of giving an ancient or archaic effect.

to these peculiarities of words he has added a list of peculiar
expressions and constructions. among the most characteristic are the
following: athuta pallakon spermata; amorphoi edrai; osa axiomata pros
archontas; oi kata polin kairoi; muthos, used in several places of
'the discourse about laws;' and connected with this the frequent use
of paramuthion and paramutheisthai in the general sense of 'address,'
'addressing'; aimulos eros; ataphoi praxeis; muthos akephalos; ethos
euthuporon. he remarks also on the frequent employment of the abstract
for the concrete; e.g. uperesia for uperetai, phugai for phugades,
mechanai in the sense of 'contrivers,' douleia for douloi, basileiai
for basileis, mainomena kedeumata for ganaika mainomenen; e chreia ton
paidon in the sense of 'indigent children,' and paidon ikanotes; to
ethos tes apeirias for e eiothuia apeiria; kuparitton upse te kai kalle
thaumasia for kuparittoi mala upselai kai kalai. he further notes some
curious uses of the genitive case, e.g. philias omologiai, maniai orges,
laimargiai edones, cheimonon anupodesiai, anosioi plegon tolmai; and of
the dative, omiliai echthrois, nomothesiai, anosioi plegon tolmai; and
of the dative omiliai echthrois, nomothesiai epitropois; and also some
rather uncommon periphrases, thremmata neilou, xuggennetor teknon for
alochos, mouses lexis for poiesis, zographon paides, anthropon spermata
and the like; the fondness for particles of limitation, especially
tis and ge, sun tisi charisi, tois ge dunamenois and the like; the
pleonastic use of tanun, of os, of os eros eipein, of ekastote; and
the periphrastic use of the preposition peri. lastly, he observes the
tendency to hyperbata or transpositions of words, and to rhythmical
uniformity as well as grammatical irregularity in the structure of the
sentences.

for nearly all the expressions which are adduced by zeller as arguments
against the genuineness of the laws, stallbaum finds some sort of
authority. there is no real ground for doubting that the work was
written by plato, merely because several words occur in it which are
not found in his other writings. an imitator may preserve the usual
phraseology of a writer better than he would himself. but, on the other
hand, the fact that authorities may be quoted in support of most of
these uses of words, does not show that the diction is not peculiar.
several of them seem to be poetical or dialectical, and exhibit an
attempt to enlarge the limits of greek prose by the introduction of
homeric and tragic expressions. most of them do not appear to have
retained any hold on the later language of greece. like several
experiments in language of the writers of the elizabethan age, they were
afterwards lost; and though occasionally found in plutarch and imitators
of plato, they have not been accepted by aristotle or passed into the
common dialect of greece.

5. unequal as the laws are in style, they contain a few passages which
are very grand and noble. for example, the address to the poets: 'best
of strangers, we also are poets of the best and noblest tragedy; for
our whole state is an imitation of the best and noblest life, which we
affirm to be indeed the very truth of tragedy.' or again, the sight
of young men and maidens in friendly intercourse with one another,
suggesting the dangers to which youth is liable from the violence of
passion; or the eloquent denunciation of unnatural lusts in the same
passage; or the charming thought that the best legislator 'orders
war for the sake of peace and not peace for the sake of war;' or the
pleasant allusion, 'o athenian--inhabitant of attica, i will not say,
for you seem to me worthy to be named after the goddess athene because
you go back to first principles;' or the pithy saying, 'many a victory
has been and will be suicidal to the victors, but education is never
suicidal;' or the fine expression that 'the walls of a city should
be allowed to sleep in the earth, and that we should not attempt to
disinter them;' or the remark that 'god is the measure of all things in
a sense far higher than any man can be;' or that 'a man should be from
the first a partaker of the truth, that he may live a true man as long
as possible;' or the principle repeatedly laid down, that 'the sins of
the fathers are not to be visited on the children;' or the description
of the funeral rites of those priestly sages who depart in innocence;
or the noble sentiment, that we should do more justice to slaves than
to equals; or the curious observation, founded, perhaps, on his own
experience, that there are a few 'divine men in every state however
corrupt, whose conversation is of inestimable value;' or the acute
remark, that public opinion is to be respected, because the judgments
of mankind about virtue are better than their practice; or the deep
religious and also modern feeling which pervades the tenth book
(whatever may be thought of the arguments); the sense of the duty of
living as a part of a whole, and in dependence on the will of god, who
takes care of the least things as well as the greatest; and the picture
of parents praying for their children--not as we may say, slightly
altering the words of plato, as if there were no truth or reality in the
gentile religions, but as if there were the greatest--are very striking
to us. we must remember that the laws, unlike the republic, do not
exhibit an ideal state, but are supposed to be on the level of human
motives and feelings; they are also on the level of the popular
religion, though elevated and purified: hence there is an attempt made
to show that the pleasant is also just. but, on the other hand, the
priority of the soul to the body, and of god to the soul, is always
insisted upon as the true incentive to virtue; especially with great
force and eloquence at the commencement of book v. and the work of
legislation is carried back to the first principles of morals.

6. no other writing of plato shows so profound an insight into the world
and into human nature as the laws. that 'cities will never cease from
ill until they are better governed,' is the text of the laws as well as
of the statesman and republic. the principle that the balance of power
preserves states; the reflection that no one ever passed his whole life
in disbelief of the gods; the remark that the characters of men are best
seen in convivial intercourse; the observation that the people must be
allowed to share not only in the government, but in the administration
of justice; the desire to make laws, not with a view to courage only,
but to all virtue; the clear perception that education begins with
birth, or even, as he would say, before birth; the attempt to purify
religion; the modern reflections, that punishment is not vindictive, and
that limits must be set to the power of bequest; the impossibility of
undeceiving the victims of quacks and jugglers; the provision for water,
and for other requirements of health, and for concealing the bodies
of the dead with as little hurt as possible to the living; above all,
perhaps, the distinct consciousness that under the actual circumstances
of mankind the ideal cannot be carried out, and yet may be a guiding
principle--will appear to us, if we remember that we are still in the
dawn of politics, to show a great depth of political wisdom.

iv. the laws of plato contain numerous passages which closely resemble
other passages in his writings. and at first sight a suspicion arises
that the repetition shows the unequal hand of the imitator. for why
should a writer say over again, in a more imperfect form, what he had
already said in his most finished style and manner? and yet it may
be urged on the other side that an author whose original powers
are beginning to decay will be very liable to repeat himself, as in
conversation, so in books. he may have forgotten what he had written
before; he may be unconscious of the decline of his own powers. hence
arises a question of great interest, bearing on the genuineness of
ancient writers. is there any criterion by which we can distinguish
the genuine resemblance from the spurious, or, in other words, the
repetition of a thought or passage by an author himself from the
appropriation of it by another? the question has, perhaps, never been
fully discussed; and, though a real one, does not admit of a precise
answer. a few general considerations on the subject may be offered:--

(a) is the difference such as might be expected to arise at different
times of life or under different circumstances?--there would be nothing
surprising in a writer, as he grew older, losing something of his own
originality, and falling more and more under the spirit of his
age. 'what a genius i had when i wrote that book!' was the pathetic
exclamation of a famous english author, when in old age he chanced to
take up one of his early works. there would be nothing surprising again
in his losing somewhat of his powers of expression, and becoming less
capable of framing language into a harmonious whole. there would also be
a strong presumption that if the variation of style was uniform, it was
attributable to some natural cause, and not to the arts of the imitator.
the inferiority might be the result of feebleness and of want of
activity of mind. but the natural weakness of a great author would
commonly be different from the artificial weakness of an imitator; it
would be continuous and uniform. the latter would be apt to fill his
work with irregular patches, sometimes taken verbally from the writings
of the author whom he personated, but rarely acquiring his spirit.
his imitation would be obvious, irregular, superficial. the patches
of purple would be easily detected among his threadbare and tattered
garments. he would rarely take the pains to put the same thought into
other words. there were many forgeries in english literature which
attained a considerable degree of success 50 or 100 years ago; but it is
doubtful whether attempts such as these could now escape detection,
if there were any writings of the same author or of the same age to
be compared with them. and ancient forgers were much less skilful than
modern; they were far from being masters in the art of deception, and
had rarely any motive for being so.

(b) but, secondly, the imitator will commonly be least capable of
understanding or imitating that part of a great writer which is most
characteristic of him. in every man's writings there is something like
himself and unlike others, which gives individuality. to appreciate
this latent quality would require a kindred mind, and minute study
and observation. there are a class of similarities which may be called
undesigned coincidences, which are so remote as to be incapable of
being borrowed from one another, and yet, when they are compared, find
a natural explanation in their being the work of the same mind. the
imitator might copy the turns of style--he might repeat images or
illustrations, but he could not enter into the inner circle of platonic
philosophy. he would understand that part of it which became popular
in the next generation, as for example, the doctrine of ideas or of
numbers: he might approve of communism. but the higher flights of plato
about the science of dialectic, or the unity of virtue, or a person who
is above the law, would be unintelligible to him.

(c) the argument from imitation assumes a different character when
the supposed imitations are associated with other passages having the
impress of original genius. the strength of the argument from undesigned
coincidences of style is much increased when they are found side by
side with thoughts and expressions which can only have come from a great
original writer. the great excellence, not only of the whole, but even
of the parts of writings, is a strong proof of their genuineness--for
although the great writer may fall below, the forger or imitator cannot
rise much above himself. whether we can attribute the worst parts of a
work to a forger and the best to a great writer,--as for example, in the
case of some of shakespeare's plays,--depends upon the probability that
they have been interpolated, or have been the joint work of two writers;
and this can only be established either by express evidence or by a
comparison of other writings of the same class. if the interpolation or
double authorship of greek writings in the time of plato could be shown
to be common, then a question, perhaps insoluble, would arise, not
whether the whole, but whether parts of the platonic dialogues are
genuine, and, if parts only, which parts. hebrew prophecies and homeric
poems and laws of manu may have grown together in early times, but there
is no reason to think that any of the dialogues of plato is the result
of a similar process of accumulation. it is therefore rash to say
with oncken (die staatslehre des aristoteles) that the form in which
aristotle knew the laws of plato must have been different from that in
which they have come down to us.

it must be admitted that these principles are difficult of application.
yet a criticism may be worth making which rests only on probabilities
or impressions. great disputes will arise about the merits of different
passages, about what is truly characteristic and original or trivial
and borrowed. many have thought the laws to be one of the greatest of
platonic writings, while in the judgment of mr. grote they hardly rise
above the level of the forged epistles. the manner in which a writer
would or would not have written at a particular time of life must be
acknowledged to be a matter of conjecture. but enough has been said to
show that similarities of a certain kind, whether criticism is able to
detect them or not, may be such as must be attributed to an original
writer, and not to a mere imitator.

(d) applying these principles to the case of the laws, we have now
to point out that they contain the class of refined or unconscious
similarities which are indicative of genuineness. the parallelisms are
like the repetitions of favourite thoughts into which every one is apt
to fall unawares in conversation or in writing. they are found in a work
which contains many beautiful and remarkable passages. we may therefore
begin by claiming this presumption in their favour. such undesigned
coincidences, as we may venture to call them, are the following. the
conception of justice as the union of temperance, wisdom, courage
(laws; republic): the latent idea of dialectic implied in the notion
of dividing laws after the kinds of virtue (laws); the approval of the
method of looking at one idea gathered from many things, 'than which a
truer was never discovered by any man' (compare republic): or again the
description of the laws as parents (laws; republic): the assumption
that religion has been already settled by the oracle of delphi (laws;
republic), to which an appeal is also made in special cases (laws): the
notion of the battle with self, a paradox for which plato in a manner
apologizes both in the laws and the republic: the remark (laws) that
just men, even when they are deformed in body, may still be perfectly
beautiful in respect of the excellent justice of their minds (compare
republic): the argument that ideals are none the worse because they
cannot be carried out (laws; republic): the near approach to the idea of
good in 'the principle which is common to all the four virtues,' a
truth which the guardians must be compelled to recognize (laws; compare
republic): or again the recognition by reason of the right pleasure and
pain, which had previously been matter of habit (laws; republic): or
the blasphemy of saying that the excellency of music is to give pleasure
(laws; republic): again the story of the sidonian cadmus (laws), which
is a variation of the phoenician tale of the earth-born men (republic):
the comparison of philosophy to a yelping she-dog, both in the republic
and in the laws: the remark that no man can practise two trades (laws;
republic): or the advantage of the middle condition (laws; republic):
the tendency to speak of principles as moulds or forms; compare the
ekmageia of song (laws), and the tupoi of religion (republic): or the
remark (laws) that 'the relaxation of justice makes many cities out of
one,' which may be compared with the republic: or the description of
lawlessness 'creeping in little by little in the fashions of music and
overturning all things,'--to us a paradox, but to plato's mind a fixed
idea, which is found in the laws as well as in the republic: or the
figure of the parts of the human body under which the parts of the state
are described (laws; republic): the apology for delay and diffuseness,
which occurs not unfrequently in the republic, is carried to an excess
in the laws (compare theaet.): the remarkable thought (laws) that the
soul of the sun is better than the sun, agrees with the relation in
which the idea of good stands to the sun in the republic, and with the
substitution of mind for the idea of good in the philebus: the passage
about the tragic poets (laws) agrees generally with the treatment of
them in the republic, but is more finely conceived, and worked out in a
nobler spirit. some lesser similarities of thought and manner should not
be omitted, such as the mention of the thirty years' old students in the
republic, and the fifty years' old choristers in the laws; or the
making of the citizens out of wax (laws) compared with the other image
(republic); or the number of the tyrant (729), which is nearly equal
with the number of days and nights in the year (730), compared with the
'slight correction' of the sacred number 5040, which is divisible by all
the numbers from 1 to 12 except 11, and divisible by 11, if two families
be deducted; or once more, we may compare the ignorance of solid
geometry of which he complains in the republic and the puzzle about
fractions with the difficulty in the laws about commensurable and
incommensurable quantities--and the malicious emphasis on the word
gunaikeios (laws) with the use of the same word (republic). these and
similar passages tend to show that the author of the republic is also
the author of the laws. they are echoes of the same voice, expressions
of the same mind, coincidences too subtle to have been invented by the
ingenuity of any imitator. the force of the argument is increased, if we
remember that no passage in the laws is exactly copied,--nowhere do
five or six words occur together which are found together elsewhere in
plato's writings.

in other dialogues of plato, as well as in the republic, there are to
be found parallels with the laws. such resemblances, as we might expect,
occur chiefly (but not exclusively) in the dialogues which, on other
grounds, we may suppose to be of later date. the punishment of evil is
to be like evil men (laws), as he says also in the theaetetus. compare
again the dependence of tragedy and comedy on one another, of which he
gives the reason in the laws--'for serious things cannot be understood
without laughable, nor opposites at all without opposites, if a man
is really to have intelligence of either'; here he puts forward the
principle which is the groundwork of the thesis of socrates in the
symposium, 'that the genius of tragedy is the same as that of comedy,
and that the writer of comedy ought to be a writer of tragedy also.'
there is a truth and right which is above law (laws), as we learn also
from the statesman. that men are the possession of the gods (laws), is
a reflection which likewise occurs in the phaedo. the remark, whether
serious or ironical (laws), that 'the sons of the gods naturally
believed in the gods, because they had the means of knowing about them,'
is found in the timaeus. the reign of cronos, who is the divine ruler
(laws), is a reminiscence of the statesman. it is remarkable that in the
sophist and statesman (soph.), plato, speaking in the character of the
eleatic stranger, has already put on the old man. the madness of the
poets, again, is a favourite notion of plato's, which occurs also in the
laws, as well as in the phaedrus, ion, and elsewhere. there are traces
in the laws of the same desire to base speculation upon history which
we find in the critias. once more, there is a striking parallel with
the paradox of the gorgias, that 'if you do evil, it is better to be
punished than to be unpunished,' in the laws: 'to live having all goods
without justice and virtue is the greatest of evils if life be immortal,
but not so great if the bad man lives but a short time.'

the point to be considered is whether these are the kind of parallels
which would be the work of an imitator. would a forger have had the wit
to select the most peculiar and characteristic thoughts of plato; would
he have caught the spirit of his philosophy; would he, instead of openly
borrowing, have half concealed his favourite ideas; would he have formed
them into a whole such as the laws; would he have given another
the credit which he might have obtained for himself; would he have
remembered and made use of other passages of the platonic writings and
have never deviated into the phraseology of them? without pressing
such arguments as absolutely certain, we must acknowledge that such a
comparison affords a new ground of real weight for believing the laws to
be a genuine writing of plato.

v. the relation of the republic to the laws is clearly set forth by
plato in the laws. the republic is the best state, the laws is the best
possible under the existing conditions of the greek world. the republic
is the ideal, in which no man calls anything his own, which may or may
not have existed in some remote clime, under the rule of some god, or
son of a god (who can say?), but is, at any rate, the pattern of
all other states and the exemplar of human life. the laws distinctly
acknowledge what the republic partly admits, that the ideal is
inimitable by us, but that we should 'lift up our eyes to the heavens'
and try to regulate our lives according to the divine image. the
citizens are no longer to have wives and children in common, and are
no longer to be under the government of philosophers. but the spirit of
communism or communion is to continue among them, though reverence for
the sacredness of the family, and respect of children for parents, not
promiscuous hymeneals, are now the foundation of the state; the sexes
are to be as nearly on an equality as possible; they are to meet
at common tables, and to share warlike pursuits (if the women will
consent), and to have a common education. the legislator has taken the
place of the philosopher, but a council of elders is retained, who are
to fulfil the duties of the legislator when he has passed out of life.
the addition of younger persons to this council by co-optation is
an improvement on the governing body of the republic. the scheme of
education in the laws is of a far lower kind than that which plato had
conceived in the republic. there he would have his rulers trained in all
knowledge meeting in the idea of good, of which the different branches
of mathematical science are but the hand-maidens or ministers; here he
treats chiefly of popular education, stopping short with the preliminary
sciences,--these are to be studied partly with a view to their practical
usefulness, which in the republic he holds cheap, and even more with a
view to avoiding impiety, of which in the republic he says nothing; he
touches very lightly on dialectic, which is still to be retained for
the rulers. yet in the laws there remain traces of the old educational
ideas. he is still for banishing the poets; and as he finds the works of
prose writers equally dangerous, he would substitute for them the study
of his own laws. he insists strongly on the importance of mathematics
as an educational instrument. he is no more reconciled to the greek
mythology than in the republic, though he would rather say nothing about
it out of a reverence for antiquity; and he is equally willing to have
recourse to fictions, if they have a moral tendency. his thoughts recur
to a golden age in which the sanctity of oaths was respected and in
which men living nearer the gods were more disposed to believe in them;
but we must legislate for the world as it is, now that the old beliefs
have passed away. though he is no longer fired with dialectical
enthusiasm, he would compel the guardians to 'look at one idea gathered
from many things,' and to 'perceive the principle which is the same in
all the four virtues.' he still recognizes the enormous influence of
music, in which every youth is to be trained for three years; and he
seems to attribute the existing degeneracy of the athenian state and
the laxity of morals partly to musical innovation, manifested in the
unnatural divorce of the instrument and the voice, of the rhythm from
the words, and partly to the influence of the mob who ruled at the
theatres. he assimilates the education of the two sexes, as far as
possible, both in music and gymnastic, and, as in the republic, he would
give to gymnastic a purely military character. in marriage, his object
is still to produce the finest children for the state. as in the
statesman, he would unite in wedlock dissimilar natures--the passionate
with the dull, the courageous with the gentle. and the virtuous tyrant
of the statesman, who has no place in the republic, again appears.
in this, as in all his writings, he has the strongest sense of the
degeneracy and incapacity of the rulers of his own time.

in the laws, the philosophers, if not banished, like the poets, are
at least ignored; and religion takes the place of philosophy in the
regulation of human life. it must however be remembered that the
religion of plato is co-extensive with morality, and is that purified
religion and mythology of which he speaks in the second book of the
republic. there is no real discrepancy in the two works. in a practical
treatise, he speaks of religion rather than of philosophy; just as he
appears to identify virtue with pleasure, and rather seeks to find
the common element of the virtues than to maintain his old paradoxical
theses that they are one, or that they are identical with knowledge. the
dialectic and the idea of good, which even glaucon in the republic could
not understand, would be out of place in a less ideal work. there may
also be a change in his own mind, the purely intellectual aspect of
philosophy having a diminishing interest to him in his old age.

some confusion occurs in the passage in which plato speaks of the
republic, occasioned by his reference to a third state, which he
proposes (d.v.) hereafter to expound. like many other thoughts in the
laws, the allusion is obscure from not being worked out. aristotle
(polit.) speaks of a state which is neither the best absolutely, nor
the best under existing conditions, but an imaginary state, inferior
to either, destitute, as he supposes, of the necessaries of
life--apparently such a beginning of primitive society as is described
in laws iii. but it is not clear that by this the third state of plato
is intended. it is possible that plato may have meant by his third state
an historical sketch, bearing the same relation to the laws which the
unfinished critias would have borne to the republic; or he may, perhaps,
have intended to describe a state more nearly approximating than the
laws to existing greek states.

the statesman is a mere fragment when compared with the laws, yet
combining a second interest of dialectic as well as politics, which is
wanting in the larger work. several points of similarity and contrast
may be observed between them. in some respects the statesman is
even more ideal than the republic, looking back to a former state of
paradisiacal life, in which the gods ruled over mankind, as the republic
looks forward to a coming kingdom of philosophers. of this kingdom of
cronos there is also mention in the laws. again, in the statesman, the
eleatic stranger rises above law to the conception of the living voice
of the lawgiver, who is able to provide for individual cases. a similar
thought is repeated in the laws: 'if in the order of nature, and by
divine destiny, a man were able to apprehend the truth about these
things, he would have no need of laws to rule over him; for there is no
law or order above knowledge, nor can mind without impiety be deemed
the subject or slave of any, but rather the lord of all.' the union of
opposite natures, who form the warp and the woof of the political web,
is a favourite thought which occurs in both dialogues (laws; statesman).

the laws are confessedly a second-best, an inferior ideal, to which
plato has recourse, when he finds that the city of philosophers is no
longer 'within the horizon of practical politics.' but it is curious
to observe that the higher ideal is always returning (compare arist.
polit.), and that he is not much nearer the actual fact, nor more on
the level of ordinary life in the laws than in the republic. it is also
interesting to remark that the new ideal is always falling away, and
that he hardly supposes the one to be more capable of being realized
than the other. human beings are troublesome to manage; and the
legislator cannot adapt his enactments to the infinite variety of
circumstances; after all he must leave the administration of them to his
successors; and though he would have liked to make them as permanent
as they are in egypt, he cannot escape from the necessity of change.
at length plato is obliged to institute a nocturnal council which is
supposed to retain the mind of the legislator, and of which some of the
members are even supposed to go abroad and inspect the institutions of
foreign countries, as a foundation for changes in their own. the spirit
of such changes, though avoiding the extravagance of a popular assembly,
being only so much change as the conservative temper of old members
is likely to allow, is nevertheless inconsistent with the fixedness of
egypt which plato wishes to impress upon hellenic institutions. he is
inconsistent with himself as the truth begins to dawn upon him that 'in
the execution things for the most part fall short of our conception of
them' (republic).

and is not this true of ideals of government in general? we are always
disappointed in them. nothing great can be accomplished in the
short space of human life; wherefore also we look forward to another
(republic). as we grow old, we are sensible that we have no power
actively to pursue our ideals any longer. we have had our opportunity
and do not aspire to be more than men: we have received our 'wages and
are going home.' neither do we despair of the future of mankind, because
we have been able to do so little in comparison of the whole. we look in
vain for consistency either in men or things. but we have seen enough of
improvement in our own time to justify us in the belief that the world
is worth working for and that a good man's life is not thrown away. such
reflections may help us to bring home to ourselves by inward sympathy
the language of plato in the laws, and to combine into something like a
whole his various and at first sight inconsistent utterances.

vi. the republic may be described as the spartan constitution appended
to a government of philosophers. but in the laws an athenian element is
also introduced. many enactments are taken from the athenian; the four
classes are borrowed from the constitution of cleisthenes, which plato
regards as the best form of athenian government, and the guardians of
the law bear a certain resemblance to the archons. in the constitution
of the laws nearly all officers are elected by a vote more or less
popular and by lot. but the assembly only exists for the purposes of
election, and has no legislative or executive powers. the nocturnal
council, which is the highest body in the state, has several of the
functions of the ancient athenian areopagus, after which it appears to
be modelled. life is to wear, as at athens, a joyous and festive look;
there are to be bacchic choruses, and men of mature age are encouraged
in moderate potations. on the other hand, the common meals, the public
education, the crypteia are borrowed from sparta and not from athens,
and the superintendence of private life, which was to be practised by
the governors, has also its prototype in sparta. the extravagant dislike
which plato shows both to a naval power and to extreme democracy is the
reverse of athenian.

the best-governed hellenic states traced the origin of their laws to
individual lawgivers. these were real persons, though we are uncertain
how far they originated or only modified the institutions which are
ascribed to them. but the lawgiver, though not a myth, was a fixed idea
in the mind of the greek,--as fixed as the trojan war or the earth-born
cadmus. 'this was what solon meant or said'--was the form in which the
athenian expressed his own conception of right and justice, or argued a
disputed point of law. and the constant reference in the laws of plato
to the lawgiver is altogether in accordance with greek modes of thinking
and speaking.

there is also, as in the republic, a pythagorean element. the highest
branch of education is arithmetic; to know the order of the heavenly
bodies, and to reconcile the apparent contradiction of their movements,
is an important part of religion; the lives of the citizens are to have
a common measure, as also their vessels and coins; the great blessing of
the state is the number 5040. plato is deeply impressed by the antiquity
of egypt, and the unchangeableness of her ancient forms of song and
dance. and he is also struck by the progress which the egyptians had
made in the mathematical sciences--in comparison of them the greeks
appeared to him to be little better than swine. yet he censures the
egyptian meanness and inhospitality to strangers. he has traced the
growth of states from their rude beginnings in a philosophical spirit;
but of any life or growth of the hellenic world in future ages he is
silent. he has made the reflection that past time is the maker of states
(book iii.); but he does not argue from the past to the future, that
the process is always going on, or that the institutions of nations
are relative to their stage of civilization. if he could have stamped
indelibly upon hellenic states the will of the legislator, he would have
been satisfied. the utmost which he expects of future generations is
that they should supply the omissions, or correct the errors which
younger statesmen detect in his enactments. when institutions have been
once subjected to this process of criticism, he would have them fixed
for ever.

the preamble.

book i. strangers, let me ask a question of you--was a god or a man the
author of your laws? 'a god, stranger. in crete, zeus is said to have
been the author of them; in sparta, as megillus will tell you, apollo.'
you cretans believe, as homer says, that minos went every ninth year to
converse with his olympian sire, and gave you laws which he brought from
him. 'yes; and there was rhadamanthus, his brother, who is reputed among
us to have been a most righteous judge.' that is a reputation worthy of
the son of zeus. and as you and megillus have been trained under these
laws, i may ask you to give me an account of them. we can talk about
them in our walk from cnosus to the cave and temple of zeus. i am told
that the distance is considerable, but probably there are shady places
under the trees, where, being no longer young, we may often rest and
converse. 'yes, stranger, a little onward there are beautiful groves of
cypresses, and green meadows in which we may repose.'

my first question is, why has the law ordained that you should have
common meals, and practise gymnastics, and bear arms? 'my answer is,
that all our institutions are of a military character. we lead the life
of the camp even in time of peace, keeping up the organization of an
army, and having meals in common; and as our country, owing to its
ruggedness, is ill-suited for heavy-armed cavalry or infantry, our
soldiers are archers, equipped with bows and arrows. the legislator was
under the idea that war was the natural state of all mankind, and that
peace is only a pretence; he thought that no possessions had any
value which were not secured against enemies.' and do you think that
superiority in war is the proper aim of government? 'certainly i do, and
my spartan friend will agree with me.' and are there wars, not only of
state against state, but of village against village, of family against
family, of individual against individual? 'yes.' and is a man his own
enemy? 'there you come to first principles, like a true votary of the
goddess athene; and this is all the better, for you will the sooner
recognize the truth of what i am saying--that all men everywhere are the
enemies of all, and each individual of every other and of himself;
and, further, that there is a victory and defeat--the best and the
worst--which each man sustains, not at the hands of another, but of
himself.' and does this extend to states and villages as well as to
individuals? 'certainly; there is a better in them which conquers or
is conquered by the worse.' whether the worse ever really conquers
the better, is a question which may be left for the present; but your
meaning is, that bad citizens do sometimes overcome the good, and that
the state is then conquered by herself, and that when they are defeated
the state is victorious over herself. or, again, in a family there may
be several brothers, and the bad may be a majority; and when the
bad majority conquer the good minority, the family are worse than
themselves. the use of the terms 'better or worse than himself or
themselves' may be doubtful, but about the thing meant there can be no
dispute. 'very true.' such a struggle might be determined by a judge.
and which will be the better judge--he who destroys the worse and lets
the better rule, or he who lets the better rule and makes the others
voluntarily obey; or, thirdly, he who destroys no one, but reconciles
the two parties? 'the last, clearly.' but the object of such a judge or
legislator would not be war. 'true.' and as there are two kinds of war,
one without and one within a state, of which the internal is by far
the worse, will not the legislator chiefly direct his attention to
this latter? he will reconcile the contending factions, and unite them
against their external enemies. 'certainly.' every legislator will
aim at the greatest good, and the greatest good is not victory in war,
whether civil or external, but mutual peace and good-will, as in the
body health is preferable to the purgation of disease. he who makes war
his object instead of peace, or who pursues war except for the sake of
peace, is not a true statesman. 'and yet, stranger, the laws both of
crete and sparta aim entirely at war.' perhaps so; but do not let us
quarrel about your legislators--let us be gentle; they were in earnest
quite as much as we are, and we must try to discover their meaning. the
poet tyrtaeus (you know his poems in crete, and my lacedaemonian friend
is only too familiar with them)--he was an athenian by birth, and a
spartan citizen:--'well,' he says, 'i sing not, i care not about any
man, however rich or happy, unless he is brave in war.' now i should
like, in the name of us all, to ask the poet a question. oh tyrtaeus, i
would say to him, we agree with you in praising those who excel in war,
but which kind of war do you mean?--that dreadful war which is termed
civil, or the milder sort which is waged against foreign enemies? you
say that you abominate 'those who are not eager to taste their enemies'
blood,' and you seem to mean chiefly their foreign enemies. 'certainly
he does.' but we contend that there are men better far than your heroes,
tyrtaeus, concerning whom another poet, theognis the sicilian, says that
'in a civil broil they are worth their weight in gold and silver.' for
in a civil war, not only courage, but justice and temperance and wisdom
are required, and all virtue is better than a part. the mercenary
soldier is ready to die at his post; yet he is commonly a violent,
senseless creature. and the legislator, whether inspired or uninspired,
will make laws with a view to the highest virtue; and this is not brute
courage, but loyalty in the hour of danger. the virtue of tyrtaeus,
although needful enough in his own time, is really of a fourth-rate
description. 'you are degrading our legislator to a very low level.'
nay, we degrade not him, but ourselves, if we believe that the laws of
lycurgus and minos had a view to war only. a divine lawgiver would have
had regard to all the different kinds of virtue, and have arranged his
laws in corresponding classes, and not in the modern fashion, which
only makes them after the want of them is felt,--about inheritances and
heiresses and assaults, and the like. as you truly said, virtue is the
business of the legislator; but you went wrong when you referred all
legislation to a part of virtue, and to an inferior part. for the object
of laws, whether the cretan or any other, is to make men happy. now
happiness or good is of two kinds--there are divine and there are human
goods. he who has the divine has the human added to him; but he who
has lost the greater is deprived of both. the lesser goods are health,
beauty, strength, and, lastly, wealth; not the blind god, pluto, but one
who has eyes to see and follow wisdom. for mind or wisdom is the most
divine of all goods; and next comes temperance, and justice springs from
the union of wisdom and temperance with courage, which is the fourth or
last. these four precede other goods, and the legislator will arrange
all his ordinances accordingly, the human going back to the divine,
and the divine to their leader mind. there will be enactments about
marriage, about education, about all the states and feelings and
experiences of men and women, at every age, in weal and woe, in war and
peace; upon all the law will fix a stamp of praise and blame. there will
also be regulations about property and expenditure, about contracts,
about rewards and punishments, and finally about funeral rites and
honours of the dead. the lawgiver will appoint guardians to preside over
these things; and mind will harmonize his ordinances, and show them to
be in agreement with temperance and justice. now i want to know whether
the same principles are observed in the laws of lycurgus and minos,
or, as i should rather say, of apollo and zeus. we must go through the
virtues, beginning with courage, and then we will show that what has
preceded has relation to virtue.

'i wish,' says the lacedaemonian, 'that you, stranger, would first
criticize cleinias and the cretan laws.' yes, is the reply, and i will
criticize you and myself, as well as him. tell me, megillus, were not
the common meals and gymnastic training instituted by your legislator
with a view to war? 'yes; and next in the order of importance comes
hunting, and fourth the endurance of pain in boxing contests, and in the
beatings which are the punishment of theft. there is, too, the so-called
crypteia or secret service, in which our youth wander about the country
night and day unattended, and even in winter go unshod and have no beds
to lie on. moreover they wrestle and exercise under a blazing sun, and
they have many similar customs.' well, but is courage only a combat
against fear and pain, and not against pleasure and flattery? 'against
both, i should say.' and which is worse,--to be overcome by pain, or
by pleasure? 'the latter.' but did the lawgivers of crete and sparta
legislate for a courage which is lame of one leg,--able to meet the
attacks of pain but not those of pleasure, or for one which can meet
both? 'for a courage which can meet both, i should say.' but if so,
where are the institutions which train your citizens to be equally brave
against pleasure and pain, and superior to enemies within as well as
without? 'we confess that we have no institutions worth mentioning which
are of this character.' i am not surprised, and will therefore only
request forbearance on the part of us all, in case the love of truth
should lead any of us to censure the laws of the others. remember that
i am more in the way of hearing criticisms of your laws than you can be;
for in well-ordered states like crete and sparta, although an old man
may sometimes speak of them in private to a ruler or elder, a similar
liberty is not allowed to the young. but now being alone we shall not
offend your legislator by a friendly examination of his laws. 'take any
freedom which you like.'

my first observation is, that your lawgiver ordered you to endure
hardships, because he thought that those who had not this discipline
would run away from those who had. but he ought to have considered
further, that those who had never learned to resist pleasure would be
equally at the mercy of those who had, and these are often among the
worst of mankind. pleasure, like fear, would overcome them and take away
their courage and freedom. 'perhaps; but i must not be hasty in giving
my assent.'

next as to temperance: what institutions have you which are adapted
to promote temperance? 'there are the common meals and gymnastic
exercises.' these are partly good and partly bad, and, as in medicine,
what is good at one time and for one person, is bad at another time and
for another person. now although gymnastics and common meals do good,
they are also a cause of evil in civil troubles, and they appear to
encourage unnatural love, as has been shown at miletus, in boeotia, and
at thurii. and the cretans are said to have invented the tale of zeus
and ganymede in order to justify their evil practices by the example of
the god who was their lawgiver. leaving the story, we may observe that
all law has to do with pleasure and pain; these are two fountains which
are ever flowing in human nature, and he who drinks of them when and as
much as he ought, is happy, and he who indulges in them to excess, is
miserable. 'you may be right, but i still incline to think that the
lacedaemonian lawgiver did well in forbidding pleasure, if i may judge
from the result. for there is no drunken revelry in sparta, and any one
found in a state of intoxication is severely punished; he is not excused
as an athenian would be at athens on account of a festival. i myself
have seen the athenians drunk at the dionysia--and at our colony,
tarentum, on a similar occasion, i have beheld the whole city in a
state of intoxication.' i admit that these festivals should be properly
regulated. yet i might reply, 'yes, spartans, that is not your vice; but
look at home and remember the licentiousness of your women.' and to
all such accusations every one of us may reply in turn:--'wonder not,
stranger; there are different customs in different countries.' now this
may be a sufficient answer; but we are speaking about the wisdom of
lawgivers and not about the customs of men. to return to the question of
drinking: shall we have total abstinence, as you have, or hard drinking,
like the scythians and thracians, or moderate potations like the
persians? 'give us arms, and we send all these nations flying before
us.' my good friend, be modest; victories and defeats often arise
from unknown causes, and afford no proof of the goodness or badness of
institutions. the stronger overcomes the weaker, as the athenians have
overcome the ceans, or the syracusans the locrians, who are, perhaps,
the best governed state in that part of the world. people are apt to
praise or censure practices without enquiring into the nature of them.
this is the way with drink: one person brings many witnesses, who sing
the praises of wine; another declares that sober men defeat drunkards
in battle; and he again is refuted in turn. i should like to conduct the
argument on some other method; for if you regard numbers, there are two
cities on one side, and ten thousand on the other. 'i am ready to pursue
any method which is likely to lead us to the truth.' let me put the
matter thus: somebody praises the useful qualities of a goat; another
has seen goats running about wild in a garden, and blames a goat or any
other animal which happens to be without a keeper. 'how absurd!' would
a pilot who is sea-sick be a good pilot? 'no.' or a general who is sick
and drunk with fear and ignorant of war a good general? 'a general
of old women he ought to be.' but can any one form an estimate of any
society, which is intended to have a ruler, and which he only sees in an
unruly and lawless state? 'no.' there is a convivial form of society--is
there not? 'yes.' and has this convivial society ever been rightly
ordered? of course you spartans and cretans have never seen anything of
the kind, but i have had wide experience, and made many enquiries about
such societies, and have hardly ever found anything right or good in
them. 'we acknowledge our want of experience, and desire to learn of
you.' will you admit that in all societies there must be a leader?
'yes.' and in time of war he must be a man of courage and absolutely
devoid of fear, if this be possible? 'certainly.' but we are talking now
of a general who shall preside at meetings of friends--and as these
have a tendency to be uproarious, they ought above all others to have a
governor. 'very good.' he should be a sober man and a man of the world,
who will keep, make, and increase the peace of the society; a drunkard
in charge of drunkards would be singularly fortunate if he avoided doing
a serious mischief. 'indeed he would.' suppose a person to censure such
meetings--he may be right, but also he may have known them only in their
disorderly state, under a drunken master of the feast; and a drunken
general or pilot cannot save his army or his ships. 'true; but although
i see the advantage of an army having a good general, i do not equally
see the good of a feast being well managed.' if you mean to ask what
good accrues to the state from the right training of a single youth or
a single chorus, i should reply, 'not much'; but if you ask what is the
good of education in general, i answer, that education makes good
men, and that good men act nobly and overcome their enemies in
battle. victory is often suicidal to the victors, because it creates
forgetfulness of education, but education itself is never suicidal. 'you
imply that the regulation of convivial meetings is a part of education;
how will you prove this?' i will tell you. but first let me offer a
word of apology. we athenians are always thought to be fond of talking,
whereas the lacedaemonian is celebrated for brevity, and the cretan
is considered to be sagacious and reserved. now i fear that i may be
charged with spinning a long discourse out of slender materials. for
drinking cannot be rightly ordered without correct principles of music,
and music runs up into education generally, and to discuss all these
matters may be tedious; if you like, therefore, we will pass on to
another part of our subject. 'are you aware, athenian, that our family
is your proxenus at sparta, and that from my boyhood i have regarded
athens as a second country, and having often fought your battles in my
youth, i have become attached to you, and love the sound of the attic
dialect? the saying is true, that the best athenians are more than
ordinarily good, because they are good by nature; therefore, be assured
that i shall be glad to hear you talk as much as you please.' 'i,
too,' adds cleinias, 'have a tie which binds me to you. you know that
epimenides, the cretan prophet, came and offered sacrifices in your city
by the command of an oracle ten years before the persian war. he told
the athenians that the persian host would not come for ten years, and
would go away again, having suffered more harm than they had inflicted.
now epimenides was of my family, and when he visited athens he entered
into friendship with your forefathers.' i see that you are willing to
listen, and i have the will to speak, if i had only the ability. but,
first, i must define the nature and power of education, and by this
road we will travel on to the god dionysus. the man who is to be good
at anything must have early training;--the future builder must play at
building, and the husbandman at digging; the soldier must learn to ride,
and the carpenter to measure and use the rule,--all the thoughts and
pleasures of children should bear on their after-profession.--do you
agree with me? 'certainly.' and we must remember further that we are
speaking of the education, not of a trainer, or of the captain of a
ship, but of a perfect citizen who knows how to rule and how to obey;
and such an education aims at virtue, and not at wealth or strength or
mere cleverness. to the good man, education is of all things the most
precious, and is also in constant need of renovation. 'we agree.' and
we have before agreed that good men are those who are able to control
themselves, and bad men are those who are not. let me offer you an
illustration which will assist our argument. man is one; but in one
and the same man are two foolish counsellors who contend within
him--pleasure and pain, and of either he has expectations which we call
hope and fear; and he is able to reason about good and evil, and reason,
when affirmed by the state, becomes law. 'we cannot follow you.' let
me put the matter in another way: every creature is a puppet of the
gods--whether he is a mere plaything or has any serious use we do not
know; but this we do know, that he is drawn different ways by cords
and strings. there is a soft golden cord which draws him towards
virtue--this is the law of the state; and there are other cords made
of iron and hard materials drawing him other ways. the golden reasoning
influence has nothing of the nature of force, and therefore requires
ministers in order to vanquish the other principles. this explains the
doctrine that cities and citizens both conquer and are conquered by
themselves. the individual follows reason, and the city law, which is
embodied reason, either derived from the gods or from the legislator.
when virtue and vice are thus distinguished, education will be better
understood, and in particular the relation of education to convivial
intercourse. and now let us set wine before the puppet. you admit that
wine stimulates the passions? 'yes.' and does wine equally stimulate
the reasoning faculties? 'no; it brings the soul back to a state of
childhood.' in such a state a man has the least control over himself,
and is, therefore, worst. 'very true.' then how can we believe that
drinking should be encouraged? 'you seem to think that it ought to be.'
and i am ready to maintain my position. 'we should like to hear you
prove that a man ought to make a beast of himself.' you are speaking
of the degradation of the soul: but how about the body? would any man
willingly degrade or weaken that? 'certainly not.' and yet if he goes to
a doctor or a gymnastic master, does he not make himself ill in the hope
of getting well? for no one would like to be always taking medicine, or
always to be in training. 'true.' and may not convivial meetings have a
similar remedial use? and if so, are they not to be preferred to other
modes of training because they are painless? 'but have they any such
use?' let us see: are there not two kinds of fear--fear of evil and fear
of an evil reputation? 'there are.' the latter kind of fear is opposed
both to the fear of pain and to the love of pleasure. this is called by
the legislator reverence, and is greatly honoured by him and by every
good man; whereas confidence, which is the opposite quality, is the
worst fault both of individuals and of states. this sort of fear or
reverence is one of the two chief causes of victory in war, fearlessness
of enemies being the other. 'true.' then every one should be both
fearful and fearless? 'yes.' the right sort of fear is infused into
a man when he comes face to face with shame, or cowardice, or the
temptations of pleasure, and has to conquer them. he must learn by
many trials to win the victory over himself, if he is ever to be made
perfect. 'that is reasonable enough.' and now, suppose that the gods had
given mankind a drug, of which the effect was to exaggerate every sort
of evil and danger, so that the bravest man entirely lost his presence
of mind and became a coward for a time:--would such a drug have any
value? 'but is there such a drug?' no; but suppose that there were;
might not the legislator use such a mode of testing courage and
cowardice? 'to be sure.' the legislator would induce fear in order to
implant fearlessness; and would give rewards or punishments to those
who behaved well or the reverse, under the influence of the drug?
'certainly.' and this mode of training, whether practised in the case
of one or many, whether in solitude or in the presence of a large
company--if a man have sufficient confidence in himself to drink the
potion amid his boon companions, leaving off in time and not taking too
much,--would be an equally good test of temperance? 'very true.' let
us return to the lawgiver and say to him, 'well, lawgiver, no such
fear-producing potion has been given by god or invented by man, but
there is a potion which will make men fearless.' 'you mean wine.'
yes; has not wine an effect the contrary of that which i was just now
describing,--first mellowing and humanizing a man, and then filling him
with confidence, making him ready to say or do anything? 'certainly.'
let us not forget that there are two qualities which should be
cultivated in the soul--first, the greatest fearlessness, and, secondly,
the greatest fear, which are both parts of reverence. courage and
fearlessness are trained amid dangers; but we have still to consider how
fear is to be trained. we desire to attain fearlessness and confidence
without the insolence and boldness which commonly attend them. for
do not love, ignorance, avarice, wealth, beauty, strength, while they
stimulate courage, also madden and intoxicate the soul? what better and
more innocent test of character is there than festive intercourse? would
you make a bargain with a man in order to try whether he is honest? or
would you ascertain whether he is licentious by putting your wife or
daughter into his hands? no one would deny that the test proposed is
fairer, speedier, and safer than any other. and such a test will be
particularly useful in the political science, which desires to know
human natures and characters. 'very true.'

book ii. and are there any other uses of well-ordered potations? there
are; but in order to explain them, i must repeat what i mean by right
education; which, if i am not mistaken, depends on the due regulation
of convivial intercourse. 'a high assumption.' i believe that virtue
and vice are originally present to the mind of children in the form of
pleasure and pain; reason and fixed principles come later, and happy is
he who acquires them even in declining years; for he who possesses
them is the perfect man. when pleasure and pain, and love and hate, are
rightly implanted in the yet unconscious soul, and after the attainment
of reason are discovered to be in harmony with her, this harmony of the
soul is virtue, and the preparatory stage, anticipating reason, i
call education. but the finer sense of pleasure and pain is apt to be
impaired in the course of life; and therefore the gods, pitying the
toils and sorrows of mortals, have allowed them to have holidays,
and given them the muses and apollo and dionysus for leaders and
playfellows. all young creatures love motion and frolic, and utter
sounds of delight; but man only is capable of taking pleasure in
rhythmical and harmonious movements. with these education begins; and
the uneducated is he who has never known the discipline of the chorus,
and the educated is he who has. the chorus is partly dance and partly
song, and therefore the well-educated must sing and dance well. but when
we say, 'he sings and dances well,' we mean that he sings and dances
what is good. and if he thinks that to be good which is really good, he
will have a much higher music and harmony in him, and be a far greater
master of imitation in sound and gesture than he who is not of this
opinion. 'true.' then, if we know what is good and bad in song and
dance, we shall know what education is? 'very true.' let us now consider
the beauty of figure, melody, song, and dance. will the same figures or
sounds be equally well adapted to the manly and the cowardly when they
are in trouble? 'how can they be, when the very colours of their faces
are different?' figures and melodies have a rhythm and harmony which are
adapted to the expression of different feelings (i may remark, by the
way, that the term 'colour,' which is a favourite word of music-masters,
is not really applicable to music). and one class of harmonies is akin
to courage and all virtue, the other to cowardice and all vice. 'we
agree.' and do all men equally like all dances? 'far otherwise.' do some
figures, then, appear to be beautiful which are not? for no one will
admit that the forms of vice are more beautiful than the forms of
virtue, or that he prefers the first kind to the second. and yet most
persons say that the merit of music is to give pleasure. but this is
impiety. there is, however, a more plausible account of the matter given
by others, who make their likes or dislikes the criterion of excellence.
sometimes nature crosses habit, or conversely, and then they say that
such and such fashions or gestures are pleasant, but they do not like to
exhibit them before men of sense, although they enjoy them in private.
'very true.' and do vicious measures and strains do any harm, or
good measures any good to the lovers of them? 'probably.' say, rather
'certainly': for the gentle indulgence which we often show to vicious
men inevitably makes us become like them. and what can be worse than
this? 'nothing.' then in a well-administered city, the poet will not be
allowed to make the songs of the people just as he pleases, or to train
his choruses without regard to virtue and vice. 'certainly not.' and
yet he may do this anywhere except in egypt; for there ages ago they
discovered the great truth which i am now asserting, that the young
should be educated in forms and strains of virtue. these they fixed and
consecrated in their temples; and no artist or musician is allowed
to deviate from them. they are literally the same which they were ten
thousand years ago. and this practice of theirs suggests the reflection
that legislation about music is not an impossible thing. but the
particular enactments must be the work of god or of some god-inspired
man, as in egypt their ancient chants are said to be the composition
of the goddess isis. the melodies which have a natural truth and
correctness should be embodied in a law, and then the desire of novelty
is not strong enough to change the old fashions. is not the origin of
music as follows? we rejoice when we think that we prosper, and we think
that we prosper when we rejoice, and at such times we cannot rest, but
our young men dance dances and sing songs, and our old men, who have
lost the elasticity of youth, regale themselves with the memory of the
past, while they contemplate the life and activity of the young. 'most
true.' people say that he who gives us most pleasure at such festivals
is to win the palm: are they right? 'possibly.' let us not be hasty
in deciding, but first imagine a festival at which the lord of the
festival, having assembled the citizens, makes a proclamation that
he shall be crowned victor who gives the most pleasure, from whatever
source derived. we will further suppose that there are exhibitions
of rhapsodists and musicians, tragic and comic poets, and even
marionette-players--which of the pleasure-makers will win? shall i
answer for you?--the marionette-players will please the children; youths
will decide for comedy; young men, educated women, and people in general
will prefer tragedy; we old men are lovers of homer and hesiod. now
which of them is right? if you and i are asked, we shall certainly say
that the old men's way of thinking ought to prevail. 'very true.' so far
i agree with the many that the excellence of music is to be measured by
pleasure; but then the pleasure must be that of the good and educated,
or better still, of one supremely virtuous and educated man. the true
judge must have both wisdom and courage. for he must lead the multitude
and not be led by them, and must not weakly yield to the uproar of
the theatre, nor give false judgment out of that mouth which has just
appealed to the gods. the ancient custom of hellas, which still prevails
in italy and sicily, left the judgment to the spectators, but this
custom has been the ruin of the poets, who seek only to please their
patrons, and has degraded the audience by the representation of inferior
characters. what is the inference? the same which we have often drawn,
that education is the training of the young idea in what the law affirms
and the elders approve. and as the soul of a child is too young to be
trained in earnest, a kind of education has been invented which tempts
him with plays and songs, as the sick are tempted by pleasant meats and
drinks. and the wise legislator will compel the poet to express in his
poems noble thoughts in fitting words and rhythms. 'but is this the
practice elsewhere than in crete and lacedaemon? in other states, as far
as i know, dances and music are constantly changed at the pleasure of
the hearers.' i am afraid that i misled you; not liking to be always
finding fault with mankind as they are, i described them as they ought
to be. but let me understand: you say that such customs exist among
the cretans and lacedaemonians, and that the rest of the world would be
improved by adopting them? 'much improved.' and you compel your poets to
declare that the righteous are happy, and that the wicked man, even if
he be as rich as midas, is unhappy? or, in the words of tyrtaeus,
'i sing not, i care not about him' who is a great warrior not having
justice; if he be unjust, 'i would not have him look calmly upon death
or be swifter than the wind'; and may he be deprived of every good--that
is, of every true good. for even if he have the goods which men regard,
these are not really goods: first health; beauty next; thirdly wealth;
and there are others. a man may have every sense purged and improved; he
may be a tyrant, and do what he likes, and live for ever: but you and
i will maintain that all these things are goods to the just, but to the
unjust the greatest of evils, if life be immortal; not so great if he
live for a short time only. if a man had health and wealth, and power,
and was insolent and unjust, his life would still be miserable; he might
be fair and rich, and do what he liked, but he would live basely, and if
basely evilly, and if evilly painfully. 'there i cannot agree with you.'
then may heaven give us the spirit of agreement, for i am as convinced
of the truth of what i say as that crete is an island; and, if i were
a lawgiver, i would exercise a censorship over the poets, and i would
punish them if they said that the wicked are happy, or that injustice is
profitable. and these are not the only matters in which i should make
my citizens talk in a different way to the world in general. if i asked
zeus and apollo, the divine legislators of crete and sparta,--'are
the just and pleasant life the same or not the same'?--and they
replied,--'not the same'; and i asked again--'which is the happier'? and
they said'--'the pleasant life,' this is an answer not fit for a god
to utter, and therefore i ought rather to put the same question to some
legislator. and if he replies 'the pleasant,' then i should say to
him, 'o my father, did you not tell me that i should live as justly as
possible'? and if to be just is to be happy, what is that principle of
happiness or good which is superior to pleasure? is the approval of
gods and men to be deemed good and honourable, but unpleasant, and their
disapproval the reverse? or is the neither doing nor suffering evil good
and honourable, although not pleasant? but you cannot make men like what
is not pleasant, and therefore you must make them believe that the
just is pleasant. the business of the legislator is to clear up this
confusion. he will show that the just and the unjust are identical with
the pleasurable and the painful, from the point of view of the just man,
of the unjust the reverse. and which is the truer judgment? surely that
of the better soul. for if not the truth, it is the best and most moral
of fictions; and the legislator who desires to propagate this useful
lie, may be encouraged by remarking that mankind have believed the story
of cadmus and the dragon's teeth, and therefore he may be assured that
he can make them believe anything, and need only consider what fiction
will do the greatest good. that the happiest is also the holiest, this
shall be our strain, which shall be sung by all three choruses alike.
first will enter the choir of children, who will lift up their voices
on high; and after them the young men, who will pray the god paean to be
gracious to the youth, and to testify to the truth of their words;
then will come the chorus of elder men, between thirty and sixty; and,
lastly, there will be the old men, and they will tell stories enforcing
the same virtues, as with the voice of an oracle. 'whom do you mean by
the third chorus?' you remember how i spoke at first of the restless
nature of young creatures, who jumped about and called out in a
disorderly manner, and i said that no other animal attained any
perception of rhythm; but that to us the gods gave apollo and the muses
and dionysus to be our playfellows. of the two first choruses i have
already spoken, and i have now to speak of the third, or dionysian
chorus, which is composed of those who are between thirty and sixty
years old. 'let us hear.' we are agreed (are we not?) that men, women,
and children should be always charming themselves with strains of
virtue, and that there should be a variety in the strains, that they may
not weary of them? now the fairest and most useful of strains will be
uttered by the elder men, and therefore we cannot let them off. but how
can we make them sing? for a discreet elderly man is ashamed to hear the
sound of his own voice in private, and still more in public. the only
way is to give them drink; this will mellow the sourness of age. no one
should be allowed to taste wine until they are eighteen; from eighteen
to thirty they may take a little; but when they have reached forty
years, they may be initiated into the mystery of drinking. thus they
will become softer and more impressible; and when a man's heart is warm
within him, he will be more ready to charm himself and others with song.
and what songs shall he sing? 'at crete and lacedaemon we only know
choral songs.' yes; that is because your way of life is military. your
young men are like wild colts feeding in a herd together; no one takes
the individual colt and trains him apart, and tries to give him the
qualities of a statesman as well as of a soldier. he who was thus
trained would be a greater warrior than those of whom tyrtaeus speaks,
for he would be courageous, and yet he would know that courage was only
fourth in the scale of virtue. 'once more, i must say, stranger, that
you run down our lawgivers.' not intentionally, my good friend, but
whither the argument leads i follow; and i am trying to find some style
of poetry suitable for those who dislike the common sort. 'very good.'
in all things which have a charm, either this charm is their good, or
they have some accompanying truth or advantage. for example, in eating
and drinking there is pleasure and also profit, that is to say, health;
and in learning there is a pleasure and also truth. there is a pleasure
or charm, too, in the imitative arts, as well as a law of proportion or
equality; but the pleasure which they afford, however innocent, is not
the criterion of their truth. the test of pleasure cannot be applied
except to that which has no other good or evil, no truth or falsehood.
but that which has truth must be judged of by the standard of truth, and
therefore imitation and proportion are to be judged of by their truth
alone. 'certainly.' and as music is imitative, it is not to be judged by
the criterion of pleasure, and the muse whom we seek is the muse not of
pleasure but of truth, for imitation has a truth. 'doubtless.' and if
so, the judge must know what is being imitated before he decides on the
quality of the imitation, and he who does not know what is true will not
know what is good. 'he will not.' will any one be able to imitate the
human body, if he does not know the number, proportion, colour, or
figure of the limbs? 'how can he?' but suppose we know some picture or
figure to be an exact resemblance of a man, should we not also require
to know whether the picture is beautiful or not? 'quite right.' the
judge of the imitation is required to know, therefore, first the
original, secondly the truth, and thirdly the merit of the execution?
'true.' then let us not weary in the attempt to bring music to the
standard of the muses and of truth. the muses are not like human poets;
they never spoil or mix rhythms or scales, or mingle instruments and
human voices, or confuse the manners and strains of men and women, or of
freemen and slaves, or of rational beings and brute animals. they do
not practise the baser sorts of musical arts, such as the 'matured
judgments,' of whom orpheus speaks, would ridicule. but modern poets
separate metre from music, and melody and rhythm from words, and use the
instrument alone without the voice. the consequence is, that the meaning
of the rhythm and of the time are not understood. i am endeavouring to
show how our fifty-year-old choristers are to be trained, and what
they are to avoid. the opinion of the multitude about these matters is
worthless; they who are only made to step in time by sheer force cannot
be critics of music. 'impossible.' then our newly-appointed minstrels
must be trained in music sufficiently to understand the nature of
rhythms and systems; and they should select such as are suitable to
men of their age, and will enable them to give and receive innocent
pleasure. this is a knowledge which goes beyond that either of the poets
or of their auditors in general. for although the poet must understand
rhythm and music, he need not necessarily know whether the imitation
is good or not, which was the third point required in a judge; but our
chorus of elders must know all three, if they are to be the instructors
of youth.

and now we will resume the original argument, which may be summed up as
follows: a convivial meeting is apt to grow tumultuous as the drinking
proceeds; every man becomes light-headed, and fancies that he can rule
the whole world. 'doubtless.' and did we not say that the souls of the
drinkers, when subdued by wine, are made softer and more malleable at
the hand of the legislator? the docility of childhood returns to them.
at times however they become too valiant and disorderly, drinking out
of their turn, and interrupting one another. and the business of the
legislator is to infuse into them that divine fear, which we call shame,
in opposition to this disorderly boldness. but in order to discipline
them there must be guardians of the law of drinking, and sober generals
who shall take charge of the private soldiers; they are as necessary in
drinking as in fighting, and he who disobeys these dionysiac commanders
will be equally disgraced. 'very good.' if a drinking festival were well
regulated, men would go away, not as they now do, greater enemies, but
better friends. of the greatest gift of dionysus i hardly like to speak,
lest i should be misunderstood. 'what is that?' according to tradition
dionysus was driven mad by his stepmother here, and in order to revenge
himself he inspired mankind with bacchic madness. but these are stories
which i would rather not repeat. however i do acknowledge that all men
are born in an imperfect state, and are at first restless, irrational
creatures: this, as you will remember, has been already said by us. 'i
remember.' and that apollo and the muses and dionysus gave us harmony
and rhythm? 'very true.' the other story implies that wine was given
to punish us and make us mad; but we contend that wine is a balm and a
cure; a spring of modesty in the soul, and of health and strength in
the body. again, the work of the chorus is co-extensive with the work of
education; rhythm and melody answer to the voice, and the motions of the
body correspond to all three, and the sound enters in and educates
the soul in virtue. 'yes.' and the movement which, when pursued as
an amusement, is termed dancing, when studied with a view to the
improvement of the body, becomes gymnastic. shall we now proceed to
speak of this? 'what cretan or lacedaemonian would approve of your
omitting gymnastic?' your question implies assent; and you will easily
understand a subject which is familiar to you. gymnastic is based on the
natural tendency of every animal to rapid motion; and man adds a sense
of rhythm, which is awakened by music; music and dancing together form
the choral art. but before proceeding i must add a crowning word about
drinking. like other pleasures, it has a lawful use; but if a state or
an individual is inclined to drink at will, i cannot allow them. i
would go further than crete or lacedaemon and have the law of the
carthaginians, that no slave of either sex should drink wine at all, and
no soldier while he is on a campaign, and no magistrate or officer while
he is on duty, and that no one should drink by daylight or on a bridal
night. and there are so many other occasions on which wine ought to
be prohibited, that there will not be many vines grown or vineyards
required in the state.

book iii. if a man wants to know the origin of states and societies, he
should behold them from the point of view of time. thousands of cities
have come into being and have passed away again in infinite ages,
every one of them having had endless forms of government; and if we
can ascertain the cause of these changes in states, that will probably
explain their origin. what do you think of ancient traditions about
deluges and destructions of mankind, and the preservation of a remnant?
'every one believes in them.' then let us suppose the world to have
been destroyed by a deluge. the survivors would be hill-shepherds, small
sparks of the human race, dwelling in isolation, and unacquainted with
the arts and vices of civilization. we may further suppose that the
cities on the plain and on the coast have been swept away, and that all
inventions, and every sort of knowledge, have perished. 'why, if all
things were as they now are, nothing would have ever been invented. all
our famous discoveries have been made within the last thousand years,
and many of them are but of yesterday.' yes, cleinias, and you must not
forget epimenides, who was really of yesterday; he practised the lesson
of moderation and abstinence which hesiod only preached. 'true.' after
the great destruction we may imagine that the earth was a desert, in
which there were a herd or two of oxen and a few goats, hardly enough
to support those who tended them; while of politics and governments
the survivors would know nothing. and out of this state of things have
arisen arts and laws, and a great deal of virtue and a great deal of
vice; little by little the world has come to be what it is. at first,
the few inhabitants would have had a natural fear of descending into the
plains; although they would want to have intercourse with one another,
they would have a difficulty in getting about, having lost the arts,
and having no means of extracting metals from the earth, or of felling
timber; for even if they had saved any tools, these would soon have been
worn out, and they could get no more until the art of metallurgy had
been again revived. faction and war would be extinguished among them,
for being solitary they would incline to be friendly; and having
abundance of pasture and plenty of milk and flesh, they would have
nothing to quarrel about. we may assume that they had also dwellings,
clothes, pottery, for the weaving and plastic arts do not require the
use of metals. in those days they were neither poor nor rich, and
there was no insolence or injustice among them; for they were of noble
natures, and lived up to their principles, and believed what they were
told; knowing nothing of land or naval warfare, or of legal practices
or party conflicts, they were simpler and more temperate, and also more
just than the men of our day. 'very true.' i am showing whence the need
of lawgivers arises, for in primitive ages they neither had nor wanted
them. men lived according to the customs of their fathers, in a simple
manner, under a patriarchal government, such as still exists both among
hellenes and barbarians, and is described in homer as prevailing among
the cyclopes:--

'they have no laws, and they dwell in rocks or on the tops of mountains,
and every one is the judge of his wife and children, and they do not
trouble themselves about one another.'

'that is a charming poet of yours, though i know little of him, for in
crete foreign poets are not much read.' 'but he is well known in sparta,
though he describes ionian rather than dorian manners, and he seems to
take your view of primitive society.' may we not suppose that government
arose out of the union of single families who survived the destruction,
and were under the rule of patriarchs, because they had originally
descended from a single father and mother? 'that is very probable.' as
time went on, men increased in number, and tilled the ground, living in
a common habitation, which they protected by walls against wild beasts;
but the several families retained the laws and customs which they
separately received from their first parents. they would naturally like
their own laws better than any others, and would be already formed by
them when they met in a common society: thus legislation imperceptibly
began among them. for in the next stage the associated families would
appoint plenipotentiaries, who would select and present to the chiefs
those of all their laws which they thought best. the chiefs in turn
would make a further selection, and would thus become the lawgivers
of the state, which they would form into an aristocracy or a monarchy.
'probably.' in the third stage various other forms of government would
arise. this state of society is described by homer in speaking of the
foundation of dardania, which, he says,

  'was built at the foot of many-fountained ida, for ilium,
   the city of the plain, as yet was not.'

here, as also in the account of the cyclopes, the poet by some divine
inspiration has attained truth. but to proceed with our tale. ilium was
built in a wide plain, on a low hill, which was surrounded by streams
descending from ida. this shows that many ages must have passed; for the
men who remembered the deluge would never have placed their city at the
mercy of the waters. when mankind began to multiply, many other cities
were built in similar situations. these cities carried on a ten years'
war against troy, by sea as well as land, for men were ceasing to be
afraid of the sea, and, in the meantime, while the chiefs of the army
were at troy, their homes fell into confusion. the youth revolted and
refused to receive their own fathers; deaths, murders, exiles ensued.
under the new name of dorians, which they received from their chief
dorieus, the exiles returned: the rest of the story is part of the
history of sparta.

thus, after digressing from the subject of laws into music and drinking,
we return to the settlement of sparta, which in laws and institutions is
the sister of crete. we have seen the rise of a first, second, and third
state, during the lapse of ages; and now we arrive at a fourth state,
and out of the comparison of all four we propose to gather the nature
of laws and governments, and the changes which may be desirable in them.
'if,' replies the spartan, 'our new discussion is likely to be as
good as the last, i would think the longest day too short for such an
employment.'

let us imagine the time when lacedaemon, and argos, and messene were all
subject, megillus, to your ancestors. afterwards, they distributed
the army into three portions, and made three cities--argos, messene,
lacedaemon. 'yes.' temenus was the king of argos, cresphontes of
messene, procles and eurysthenes ruled at lacedaemon. 'just so.' and
they all swore to assist any one of their number whose kingdom was
subverted. 'yes.' but did we not say that kingdoms or governments can
only be subverted by themselves? 'that is true.' yes, and the truth is
now proved by facts: there were certain conditions upon which the three
kingdoms were to assist one another; the government was to be mild and
the people obedient, and the kings and people were to unite in assisting
either of the two others when they were wronged. this latter condition
was a great security. 'clearly.' such a provision is in opposition to
the common notion that the lawgiver should make only such laws as the
people like; but we say that he should rather be like a physician,
prepared to effect a cure even at the cost of considerable suffering.
'very true.' the early lawgivers had another great advantage--they
were saved from the reproach which attends a division of land and the
abolition of debts. no one could quarrel with the dorians for dividing
the territory, and they had no debts of long standing. 'they had not.'
then what was the reason why their legislation signally failed? for
there were three kingdoms, two of them quickly lost their original
constitution. that is a question which we cannot refuse to answer, if
we mean to proceed with our old man's game of enquiring into laws
and institutions. and the dorian institutions are more worthy of
consideration than any other, having been evidently intended to be a
protection not only to the peloponnese, but to all the hellenes against
the barbarians. for the capture of troy by the achaeans had given great
offence to the assyrians, of whose empire it then formed part, and
they were likely to retaliate. accordingly the royal heraclid brothers
devised their military constitution, which was organised on a far better
plan than the old trojan expedition; and the dorians themselves were far
superior to the achaeans, who had taken part in that expedition, and had
been conquered by them. such a scheme, undertaken by men who had shared
with one another toils and dangers, sanctioned by the delphian oracle,
under the guidance of the heraclidae, seemed to have a promise of
permanence. 'naturally.' yet this has not proved to be the case. instead
of the three being one, they have always been at war; had they been
united, in accordance with the original intention, they would have been
invincible.

and what caused their ruin? did you ever observe that there are
beautiful things of which men often say, 'what wonders they would have
effected if rightly used?' and yet, after all, this may be a mistake.
and so i say of the heraclidae and their expedition, which i may perhaps
have been justified in admiring, but which nevertheless suggests to me
the general reflection,--'what wonders might not strength and military
resources have accomplished, if the possessor had only known how to use
them!' for consider: if the generals of the army had only known how
to arrange their forces, might they not have given their subjects
everlasting freedom, and the power of doing what they would in all the
world? 'very true.' suppose a person to express his admiration of wealth
or rank, does he not do so under the idea that by the help of these
he can attain his desires? all men wish to obtain the control of all
things, and they are always praying for what they desire. 'certainly.'
and we ask for our friends what they ask for themselves. 'yes.' dear is
the son to the father, and yet the son, if he is young and foolish, will
often pray to obtain what the father will pray that he may not obtain.
'true.' and when the father, in the heat of youth or the dotage of age,
makes some rash prayer, the son, like hippolytus, may have reason to
pray that the word of his father may be ineffectual. 'you mean that a
man should pray to have right desires, before he prays that his desires
may be fulfilled; and that wisdom should be the first object of our
prayers?' yes; and you will remember my saying that wisdom should be the
principal aim of the legislator; but you said that defence in war
came first. and i replied, that there were four virtues, whereas you
acknowledged one only--courage, and not wisdom which is the guide of all
the rest. and i repeat--in jest if you like, but i am willing that you
should receive my words in earnest--that 'the prayer of a fool is full
of danger.' i will prove to you, if you will allow me, that the ruin
of those states was not caused by cowardice or ignorance in war, but
by ignorance of human affairs. 'pray proceed: our attention will show
better than compliments that we prize your words.' i maintain that
ignorance is, and always has been, the ruin of states; wherefore the
legislator should seek to banish it from the state; and the greatest
ignorance is the love of what is known to be evil, and the hatred of
what is known to be good; this is the last and greatest conflict of
pleasure and reason in the soul. i say the greatest, because affecting
the greater part of the soul; for the passions are in the individual
what the people are in a state. and when they become opposed to reason
or law, and instruction no longer avails--that is the last and greatest
ignorance of states and men. 'i agree.' let this, then, be our first
principle:--that the citizen who does not know how to choose between
good and evil must not have authority, although he possess great mental
gifts, and many accomplishments; for he is really a fool. on the other
hand, he who has this knowledge may be unable either to read or swim;
nevertheless, he shall be counted wise and permitted to rule. for how
can there be wisdom where there is no harmony?--the wise man is the
saviour, and he who is devoid of wisdom is the destroyer of states and
households. there are rulers and there are subjects in states. and the
first claim to rule is that of parents to rule over their children; the
second, that of the noble to rule over the ignoble; thirdly, the elder
must govern the younger; in the fourth place, the slave must obey his
master; fifthly, there is the power of the stronger, which the poet
pindar declares to be according to nature; sixthly, there is the rule of
the wiser, which is also according to nature, as i must inform pindar,
if he does not know, and is the rule of law over obedient subjects.
'most true.' and there is a seventh kind of rule which the gods
love,--in this the ruler is elected by lot.

then, now, we playfully say to him who fancies that it is easy to
make laws:--you see, legislator, the many and inconsistent claims to
authority; here is a spring of troubles which you must stay. and first
of all you must help us to consider how the kings of argos and messene
in olden days destroyed their famous empire--did they forget the saying
of hesiod, that 'the half is better than the whole'? and do we suppose
that the ignorance of this truth is less fatal to kings than to peoples?
'probably the evil is increased by their way of life.' the kings of
those days transgressed the laws and violated their oaths. their deeds
were not in harmony with their words, and their folly, which seemed to
them wisdom, was the ruin of the state. and how could the legislator
have prevented this evil?--the remedy is easy to see now, but was not
easy to foresee at the time. 'what is the remedy?' the institutions of
sparta may teach you, megillus. wherever there is excess, whether the
vessel has too large a sail, or the body too much food, or the mind
too much power, there destruction is certain. and similarly, a man who
possesses arbitrary power is soon corrupted, and grows hateful to
his dearest friends. in order to guard against this evil, the god who
watched over sparta gave you two kings instead of one, that they
might balance one another; and further to lower the pulse of your body
politic, some human wisdom, mingled with divine power, tempered the
strength and self-sufficiency of youth with the moderation of age in
the institution of your senate. a third saviour bridled your rising and
swelling power by ephors, whom he assimilated to officers elected by
lot: and thus the kingly power was preserved, and became the preserver
of all the rest. had the constitution been arranged by the original
legislators, not even the portion of aristodemus would have been saved;
for they had no political experience, and imagined that a youthful
spirit invested with power could be restrained by oaths. now that god
has instructed us in the arts of legislation, there is no merit in
seeing all this, or in learning wisdom after the event. but if the
coming danger could have been foreseen, and the union preserved, then
no persian or other enemy would have dared to attack hellas; and indeed
there was not so much credit to us in defeating the enemy, as discredit
in our disloyalty to one another. for of the three cities one only
fought on behalf of hellas; and of the two others, argos refused
her aid; and messenia was actually at war with sparta: and if the
lacedaemonians and athenians had not united, the hellenes would have
been absorbed in the persian empire, and dispersed among the barbarians.
we make these reflections upon past and present legislators because we
desire to find out what other course could have been followed. we were
saying just now, that a state can only be free and wise and harmonious
when there is a balance of powers. there are many words by which we
express the aims of the legislator,--temperance, wisdom, friendship; but
we need not be disturbed by the variety of expression,--these words have
all the same meaning. 'i should like to know at what in your opinion
the legislator should aim.' hear me, then. there are two mother forms
of states--one monarchy, and the other democracy: the persians have
the first in the highest form, and the athenians the second; and no
government can be well administered which does not include both. there
was a time when both the persians and athenians had more the character
of a constitutional state than they now have. in the days of cyrus the
persians were freemen as well as lords of others, and their soldiers
were free and equal, and the kings used and honoured all the talent
which they could find, and so the nation waxed great, because there was
freedom and friendship and communion of soul. but cyrus, though a wise
general, never troubled himself about the education of his family. he
was a soldier from his youth upward, and left his children who were born
in the purple to be educated by women, who humoured and spoilt them.
'a rare education, truly!' yes, such an education as princesses who had
recently grown rich might be expected to give them in a country where
the men were solely occupied with warlike pursuits. 'likely enough.'
their father had possessions of men and animals, and never considered
that the race to whom he was about to make them over had been educated
in a very different school, not like the persian shepherd, who was
well able to take care of himself and his own. he did not see that
his children had been brought up in the median fashion, by women and
eunuchs. the end was that one of the sons of cyrus slew the other, and
lost the kingdom by his own folly. observe, again, that darius, who
restored the kingdom, had not received a royal education. he was one of
the seven chiefs, and when he came to the throne he divided the empire
into seven provinces; and he made equal laws, and implanted friendship
among the people. hence his subjects were greatly attached to him, and
cheerfully helped him to extend his empire. next followed xerxes,
who had received the same royal education as cambyses, and met with a
similar fate. the reflection naturally occurs to us--how could darius,
with all his experience, have made such a mistake! the ruin of xerxes
was not a mere accident, but the evil life which is generally led by the
sons of very rich and royal persons; and this is what the legislator has
seriously to consider. justly may the lacedaemonians be praised for not
giving special honour to birth or wealth; for such advantages are not to
be highly esteemed without virtue, and not even virtue is to be esteemed
unless it be accompanied by temperance. 'explain.' no one would like
to live in the same house with a courageous man who had no control over
himself, nor with a clever artist who was a rogue. nor can justice
and wisdom ever be separated from temperance. but considering these
qualities with reference to the honour and dishonour which is to be
assigned to them in states, would you say, on the other hand, that
temperance, if existing without the other virtues in the soul, is worth
anything or nothing? 'i cannot tell.' you have answered well. it would
be absurd to speak of temperance as belonging to the class of honourable
or of dishonourable qualities, because all other virtues in their
various classes require temperance to be added to them; having the
addition, they are honoured not in proportion to that, but to their own
excellence. and ought not the legislator to determine these classes?
'certainly.' suppose then that, without going into details, we make
three great classes of them. most honourable are the goods of the soul,
always assuming temperance as a condition of them; secondly, those of
the body; thirdly, external possessions. the legislator who puts them in
another order is doing an unholy and unpatriotic thing.

these remarks were suggested by the history of the persian kings; and to
them i will now return. the ruin of their empire was caused by the
loss of freedom and the growth of despotism; all community of feeling
disappeared. hatred and spoliation took the place of friendship; the
people no longer fought heartily for their masters; the rulers, finding
their myriads useless on the field of battle, resorted to mercenaries as
their only salvation, and were thus compelled by their circumstances
to proclaim the stupidest of falsehoods--that virtue is a trifle in
comparison of money.

but enough of the persians: a different lesson is taught by the
athenians, whose example shows that a limited freedom is far better than
an unlimited. ancient athens, at the time of the persian invasion,
had such a limited freedom. the people were divided into four classes,
according to the amount of their property, and the universal love of
order, as well as the fear of the approaching host, made them obedient
and willing citizens. for darius had sent datis and artaphernes,
commanding them under pain of death to subjugate the eretrians and
athenians. a report, whether true or not, came to athens that all the
eretrians had been 'netted'; and the athenians in terror sent all
over hellas for assistance. none came to their relief except the
lacedaemonians, and they arrived a day too late, when the battle of
marathon had been already fought. in process of time xerxes came to
the throne, and the athenians heard of nothing but the bridge over the
hellespont, and the canal of athos, and the innumerable host and fleet.
they knew that these were intended to avenge the defeat of marathon.
their case seemed desperate, for there was no hellene likely to assist
them by land, and at sea they were attacked by more than a thousand
vessels;--their only hope, however slender, was in victory; so they
relied upon themselves and upon the gods. their common danger, and
the influence of their ancient constitution, greatly tended to promote
harmony among them. reverence and fear--that fear which the coward never
knows--made them fight for their altars and their homes, and saved them
from being dispersed all over the world. 'your words, athenian, are
worthy of your country.' and you megillus, who have inherited the
virtues of your ancestors, are worthy to hear them. let me ask you
to take the moral of my tale. the persians have lost their liberty
in absolute slavery, and we in absolute freedom. in ancient times the
athenian people were not the masters, but the servants of the laws. 'of
what laws?' in the first place, there were laws about music, and the
music was of various kinds: there was one kind which consisted of hymns,
another of lamentations; there was also the paean and the dithyramb,
and the so-called 'laws' (nomoi) or strains, which were played upon the
harp. the regulation of such matters was not left to the whistling and
clapping of the crowd; there was silence while the judges decided, and
the boys, and the audience in general, were kept in order by raps of a
stick. but after a while there arose a new race of poets, men of genius
certainly, however careless of musical truth and propriety, who made
pleasure the only criterion of excellence. that was a test which the
spectators could apply for themselves; the whole audience, instead of
being mute, became vociferous, and a theatrocracy took the place of an
aristocracy. could the judges have been free, there would have been no
great harm done; a musical democracy would have been well enough--but
conceit has been our ruin. everybody knows everything, and is ready to
say anything; the age of reverence is gone, and the age of irreverence
and licentiousness has succeeded. 'most true.' and with this freedom
comes disobedience to rulers, parents, elders,--in the latter days to
the law also; the end returns to the beginning, and the old titanic
nature reappears--men have no regard for the gods or for oaths; and the
evils of the human race seem as if they would never cease. whither are
we running away? once more we must pull up the argument with bit and
curb, lest, as the proverb says, we should fall off our ass. 'good.'
our purpose in what we have been saying is to prove that the legislator
ought to aim at securing for a state three things--freedom, friendship,
wisdom. and we chose two states;--one was the type of freedom, and the
other of despotism; and we showed that when in a mean they attained
their highest perfection. in a similar spirit we spoke of the dorian
expedition, and of the settlement on the hills and in the plains of
troy; and of music, and the use of wine, and of all that preceded.

and now, has our discussion been of any use? 'yes, stranger; for by
a singular coincidence the cretans are about to send out a colony,
of which the settlement has been confided to the cnosians. ten
commissioners, of whom i am one, are to give laws to the colonists, and
we may give any which we please--cretan or foreign. and therefore let
us make a selection from what has been said, and then proceed with the
construction of the state.' very good: i am quite at your service. 'and
i too,' says megillus.

book iv. and now, what is this city? i do not want to know what is to
be the name of the place (for some accident,--a river or a local deity,
will determine that), but what the situation is, whether maritime or
inland. 'the city will be about eleven miles from the sea.' are there
harbours? 'excellent.' and is the surrounding country self-supporting?
'almost.' any neighbouring states? 'no; and that is the reason for
choosing the place, which has been deserted from time immemorial.' and
is there a fair proportion of hill and plain and wood? 'like crete
in general, more hill than plain.' then there is some hope for your
citizens; had the city been on the sea, and dependent for support
on other countries, no human power could have preserved you from
corruption. even the distance of eleven miles is hardly enough. for the
sea, although an agreeable, is a dangerous companion, and a highway of
strange morals and manners as well as of commerce. but as the country is
only moderately fertile there will be no great export trade and no
great returns of gold and silver, which are the ruin of states. is there
timber for ship-building? 'there is no pine, nor much cypress; and very
little stone-pine or plane wood for the interior of ships.' that is
good. 'why?' because the city will not be able to imitate the bad ways
of her enemies. 'what is the bearing of that remark?' to explain my
meaning, i would ask you to remember what we said about the cretan laws,
that they had an eye to war only; whereas i maintained that they ought
to have included all virtue. and i hope that you in your turn will
retaliate upon me if i am false to my own principle. for i consider that
the lawgiver should go straight to the mark of virtue and justice, and
disregard wealth and every other good when separated from virtue.
what further i mean, when i speak of the imitation of enemies, i will
illustrate by the story of minos, if our cretan friend will allow me to
mention it. minos, who was a great sea-king, imposed upon the athenians
a cruel tribute, for in those days they were not a maritime power; they
had no timber for ship-building, and therefore they could not 'imitate
their enemies'; and better far, as i maintain, would it have been for
them to have lost many times over the lives which they devoted to the
tribute than to have turned soldiers into sailors. naval warfare is not
a very praiseworthy art; men should not be taught to leap on shore, and
then again to hurry back to their ships, or to find specious excuses for
throwing away their arms; bad customs ought not to be gilded with fine
words. and retreat is always bad, as we are taught in homer, when he
introduces odysseus, setting forth to agamemnon the danger of ships
being at hand when soldiers are disposed to fly. an army of lions
trained in such ways would fly before a herd of deer. further, a city
which owes its preservation to a crowd of pilots and oarsmen and other
undeserving persons, cannot bestow rewards of honour properly; and
this is the ruin of states. 'still, in crete we say that the battle of
salamis was the salvation of hellas.' such is the prevailing
opinion. but i and megillus say that the battle of marathon began the
deliverance, and that the battle of plataea completed it; for these
battles made men better, whereas the battles of salamis and artemisium
made them no better. and we further affirm that mere existence is not
the great political good of individuals or states, but the continuance
of the best existence. 'certainly.' let us then endeavour to follow this
principle in colonization and legislation.

and first, let me ask you who are to be the colonists? may any one
come from any city of crete? for you would surely not send a general
invitation to all hellas. yet i observe that in crete there are people
who have come from argos and aegina and other places. 'our recruits
will be drawn from all crete, and of other hellenes we should prefer
peloponnesians. as you observe, there are argives among the cretans;
moreover the gortynians, who are the best of all cretans, have come from
gortys in peloponnesus.'

colonization is in some ways easier when the colony goes out in a swarm
from one country, owing to the pressure of population, or revolution, or
war. in this case there is the advantage that the new colonists have
a community of race, language, and laws. but then again, they are less
obedient to the legislator; and often they are anxious to keep the very
laws and customs which caused their ruin at home. a mixed multitude,
on the other hand, is more tractable, although there is a difficulty
in making them pull together. there is nothing, however, which perfects
men's virtue more than legislation and colonization. and yet i have a
word to say which may seem to be depreciatory of legislators. 'what is
that?'

i was going to make the saddening reflection, that accidents of all
sorts are the true legislators,--wars and pestilences and famines and
the frequent recurrence of bad seasons. the observer will be inclined to
say that almost all human things are chance; and this is certainly true
about navigation and medicine, and the art of the general. but there is
another thing which may equally be said. 'what is it?' that god governs
all things, and that chance and opportunity co-operate with him. and
according to yet a third view, art has part with them, for surely in a
storm it is well to have a pilot? and the same is true of legislation:
even if circumstances are favourable, a skilful lawgiver is still
necessary. 'most true.' all artists would pray for certain conditions
under which to exercise their art: and would not the legislator do the
same? 'certainly?' come, legislator, let us say to him, and what are the
conditions which you would have? he will answer, grant me a city which
is ruled by a tyrant; and let the tyrant be young, mindful, teachable,
courageous, magnanimous; and let him have the inseparable condition
of all virtue, which is temperance--not prudence, but that natural
temperance which is the gift of children and animals, and is hardly
reckoned among goods--with this he must be endowed, if the state is to
acquire the form most conducive to happiness in the speediest manner.
and i must add one other condition: the tyrant must be fortunate, and
his good fortune must consist in his having the co-operation of a great
legislator. when god has done all this, he has done the best which
he can for a state; not so well if he has given them two legislators
instead of one, and less and less well if he has given them a great
many. an orderly tyranny most easily passes into the perfect state;
in the second degree, a monarchy; in the third degree, a democracy; an
oligarchy is worst of all. 'i do not understand.' i suppose that you
have never seen a city which is subject to a tyranny? 'i have no desire
to see one.' you would have seen what i am describing, if you ever had.
the tyrant can speedily change the manners of a state, and affix
the stamp of praise or blame on any action which he pleases; for the
citizens readily follow the example which he sets. there is no quicker
way of making changes; but there is a counterbalancing difficulty. it is
hard to find the divine love of temperance and justice existing in any
powerful form of government, whether in a monarchy or an oligarchy. in
olden days there were chiefs like nestor, who was the most eloquent and
temperate of mankind, but there is no one his equal now. if such an one
ever arises among us, blessed will he be, and blessed they who listen to
his words. for where power and wisdom and temperance meet in one, there
are the best laws and constitutions. i am endeavouring to show you how
easy under the conditions supposed, and how difficult under any other,
is the task of giving a city good laws. 'how do you mean?' let us old
men attempt to mould in words a constitution for your new state, as
children make figures out of wax. 'proceed. what constitution shall we
give--democracy, oligarchy, or aristocracy?' to which of these classes,
megillus, do you refer your own state? 'the spartan constitution seems
to me to contain all these elements. our state is a democracy and also
an aristocracy; the power of the ephors is tyrannical, and we have
an ancient monarchy.' 'much the same,' adds cleinias, 'may be said of
cnosus.' the reason is that you have polities, but other states are
mere aggregations of men dwelling together, which are named after their
several ruling powers; whereas a state, if an 'ocracy' at all, should
be called a theocracy. a tale of old will explain my meaning. there is
a tradition of a golden age, in which all things were spontaneous and
abundant. cronos, then lord of the world, knew that no mortal nature
could endure the temptations of power, and therefore he appointed demons
or demi-gods, who are of a superior race, to have dominion over man, as
man has dominion over the animals. they took care of us with great ease
and pleasure to themselves, and no less to us; and the tradition says
that only when god, and not man, is the ruler, can the human race cease
from ill. this was the manner of life which prevailed under cronos, and
which we must strive to follow so far as the principle of immortality
still abides in us and we live according to law and the dictates of
right reason. but in an oligarchy or democracy, when the governing
principle is athirst for pleasure, the laws are trampled under foot, and
there is no possibility of salvation. is it not often said that there
are as many forms of laws as there are governments, and that they
have no concern either with any one virtue or with all virtue, but are
relative to the will of the government? which is as much as to say that
'might makes right.' 'what do you mean?' i mean that governments enact
their own laws, and that every government makes self-preservation its
principal aim. he who transgresses the laws is regarded as an evil-doer,
and punished accordingly. this was one of the unjust principles of
government which we mentioned when speaking of the different claims to
rule. we were agreed that parents should rule their children, the elder
the younger, the noble the ignoble. but there were also several other
principles, and among them pindar's 'law of violence.' to whom then is
our state to be entrusted? for many a government is only a victorious
faction which has a monopoly of power, and refuses any share to the
conquered, lest when they get into office they should remember their
wrongs. such governments are not polities, but parties; nor are any laws
good which are made in the interest of particular classes only, and not
of the whole. and in our state i mean to protest against making any
man a ruler because he is rich, or strong, or noble. but those who are
obedient to the laws, and who win the victory of obedience, shall be
promoted to the service of the gods according to the degree of their
obedience. when i call the ruler the servant or minister of the law,
this is not a mere paradox, but i mean to say that upon a willingness to
obey the law the existence of the state depends. 'truly, stranger,
you have a keen vision.' why, yes; every man when he is old has his
intellectual vision most keen. and now shall we call in our colonists
and make a speech to them? friends, we say to them, god holds in his
hand the beginning, middle, and end of all things, and he moves in a
straight line towards the accomplishment of his will. justice always
bears him company, and punishes those who fall short of his laws. he who
would be happy follows humbly in her train; but he who is lifted up with
pride, or wealth, or honour, or beauty, is soon deserted by god, and,
being deserted, he lives in confusion and disorder. to many he seems a
great man; but in a short time he comes to utter destruction. wherefore,
seeing these things, what ought we to do or think? 'every man ought to
follow god.' what life, then, is pleasing to god? there is an old saying
that 'like agrees with like, measure with measure,' and god ought to
be our measure in all things. the temperate man is the friend of god
because he is like him, and the intemperate man is not his friend,
because he is not like him. and the conclusion is, that the best of all
things for a good man is to pray and sacrifice to the gods; but the bad
man has a polluted soul; and therefore his service is wasted upon the
gods, while the good are accepted of them. i have told you the mark at
which we ought to aim. you will say, how, and with what weapons? in the
first place we affirm, that after the olympian gods and the gods of the
state, honour should be given to the gods below, and to them should
be offered everything in even numbers and of the second choice; the
auspicious odd numbers and everything of the first choice are reserved
for the gods above. next demi-gods or spirits must be honoured, and
then heroes, and after them family gods, who will be worshipped at their
local seats according to law. further, the honour due to parents should
not be forgotten; children owe all that they have to them, and the debt
must be repaid by kindness and attention in old age. no unbecoming word
must be uttered before them; for there is an avenging angel who hears
them when they are angry, and the child should consider that the parent
when he has been wronged has a right to be angry. after their death
let them have a moderate funeral, such as their fathers have had before
them; and there shall be an annual commemoration of them. living on this
wise, we shall be accepted of the gods, and shall pass our days in good
hope. the law will determine all our various duties towards relatives
and friends and other citizens, and the whole state will be happy and
prosperous. but if the legislator would persuade as well as command,
he will add prefaces to his laws which will predispose the citizens to
virtue. even a little accomplished in the way of gaining the hearts of
men is of great value. for most men are in no particular haste to become
good. as hesiod says:

'long and steep is the first half of the way to virtue, but when you
have reached the top the rest is easy.'

'those are excellent words.' yes; but may i tell you the effect which
the preceding discourse has had upon me? i will express my meaning in
an address to the lawgiver:--o lawgiver, if you know what we ought to do
and say, you can surely tell us;--you are not like the poet, who, as you
were just now saying, does not know the effect of his own words. and the
poet may reply, that when he sits down on the tripod of the muses he is
not in his right mind, and that being a mere imitator he may be allowed
to say all sorts of opposite things, and cannot tell which of them is
true. but this licence cannot be allowed to the lawgiver. for example,
there are three kinds of funerals; one of them is excessive, another
mean, a third moderate, and you say that the last is right. now if i
had a rich wife, and she told me to bury her, and i were to sing of her
burial, i should praise the extravagant kind; a poor man would commend
a funeral of the meaner sort, and a man of moderate means would prefer a
moderate funeral. but you, as legislator, would have to say exactly what
you meant by 'moderate.' 'very true.' and is our lawgiver to have no
preamble or interpretation of his laws, never offering a word of advice
to his subjects, after the manner of some doctors? for of doctors are
there not two kinds? the one gentle and the other rough, doctors who are
freemen and learn themselves and teach their pupils scientifically, and
doctor's assistants who get their knowledge empirically by attending on
their masters? 'of course there are.' and did you ever observe that the
gentlemen doctors practise upon freemen, and that slave doctors confine
themselves to slaves? the latter go about the country or wait for the
slaves at the dispensaries. they hold no parley with their patients
about their diseases or the remedies of them; they practise by the rule
of thumb, and give their decrees in the most arbitrary manner. when they
have doctored one patient they run off to another, whom they treat with
equal assurance, their duty being to relieve the master of the care
of his sick slaves. but the other doctor, who practises on freemen,
proceeds in quite a different way. he takes counsel with his patient and
learns from him, and never does anything until he has persuaded him of
what he is doing. he trusts to influence rather than force. now is not
the use of both methods far better than the use of either alone? and
both together may be advantageously employed by us in legislation.

we may illustrate our proposal by an example. the laws relating to
marriage naturally come first, and therefore we may begin with them. the
simple law would be as follows:--a man shall marry between the ages of
thirty and thirty-five; if he do not, he shall be fined or deprived of
certain privileges. the double law would add the reason why: forasmuch
as man desires immortality, which he attains by the procreation of
children, no one should deprive himself of his share in this good. he
who obeys the law is blameless, but he who disobeys must not be a gainer
by his celibacy; and therefore he shall pay a yearly fine, and shall not
be allowed to receive honour from the young. that is an example of what
i call the double law, which may enable us to judge how far the addition
of persuasion to threats is desirable. 'lacedaemonians in general,
stranger, are in favour of brevity; in this case, however, i prefer
length. but cleinias is the real lawgiver, and he ought to be first
consulted.' 'thank you, megillus.' whether words are to be many or few,
is a foolish question:--the best and not the shortest forms are always
to be approved. and legislators have never thought of the advantages
which they might gain by using persuasion as well as force, but trust to
force only. and i have something else to say about the matter. here have
we been from early dawn until noon, discoursing about laws, and all that
we have been saying is only the preamble of the laws which we are about
to give. i tell you this, because i want you to observe that songs and
strains have all of them preludes, but that laws, though called by the
same name (nomoi), have never any prelude. now i am disposed to give
preludes to laws, dividing them into two parts--one containing the
despotic command, which i described under the image of the slave
doctor--the other the persuasive part, which i term the preamble. the
legislator should give preludes or preambles to his laws. 'that shall
be the way in my colony.' i am glad that you agree with me; this is
a matter which it is important to remember. a preamble is not always
necessary to a law: the lawgiver must determine when it is needed, as
the musician determines when there is to be a prelude to a song. 'most
true: and now, having a preamble, let us recommence our discourse.'
enough has been said of gods and parents, and we may proceed to consider
what relates to the citizens--their souls, bodies, properties,--their
occupations and amusements; and so arrive at the nature of education.

the first word of the laws somewhat abruptly introduces the thought
which is present to the mind of plato throughout the work, namely, that
law is of divine origin. in the words of a great english writer--'her
seat is the bosom of god, her voice the harmony of the world.' though
the particular laws of sparta and crete had a narrow and imperfect aim,
this is not true of divine laws, which are based upon the principles of
human nature, and not framed to meet the exigencies of the moment. they
have their natural divisions, too, answering to the kinds of virtue;
very unlike the discordant enactments of an athenian assembly or of an
english parliament. yet we may observe two inconsistencies in plato's
treatment of the subject: first, a lesser, inasmuch as he does not
clearly distinguish the cretan and spartan laws, of which the exclusive
aim is war, from those other laws of zeus and apollo which are said to
be divine, and to comprehend all virtue. secondly, we may retort on him
his own complaint against sparta and crete, that he has himself given us
a code of laws, which for the most part have a military character; and
that we cannot point to 'obvious examples of similar institutions which
are concerned with pleasure;' at least there is only one such, that
which relates to the regulation of convivial intercourse. the military
spirit which is condemned by him in the beginning of the laws, reappears
in the seventh and eighth books.

the mention of minos the great lawgiver, and of rhadamanthus the
righteous administrator of the law, suggests the two divisions of the
laws into enactments and appointments of officers. the legislator and
the judge stand side by side, and their functions cannot be wholly
distinguished. for the judge is in some sort a legislator, at any
rate in small matters; and his decisions growing into precedents, must
determine the innumerable details which arise out of the conflict of
circumstances. these plato proposes to leave to a younger generation
of legislators. the action of courts of law in making law seems to
have escaped him, probably because the athenian law-courts were popular
assemblies; and, except in a mythical form, he can hardly be said to
have had before his eyes the ideal of a judge. in reading the laws of
plato, or any other ancient writing about laws, we should consider
how gradual the process is by which not only a legal system, but the
administration of a court of law, becomes perfected.

there are other subjects on which plato breaks ground, as his manner is,
early in the work. first, he gives a sketch of the subject of laws; they
are to comprehend the whole of human life, from infancy to age, and from
birth to death, although the proposed plan is far from being regularly
executed in the books which follow, partly owing to the necessity of
describing the constitution as well as the laws of his new colony.
secondly, he touches on the power of music, which may exercise so
great an influence on the character of men for good or evil; he refers
especially to the great offence--which he mentions again, and which he
had condemned in the republic--of varying the modes and rhythms, as
well as to that of separating the words from the music. thirdly, he
reprobates the prevalence of unnatural loves in sparta and crete, which
he attributes to the practice of syssitia and gymnastic exercises, and
considers to be almost inseparable from them. to this subject he again
returns in the eighth book. fourthly, the virtues are affirmed to be
inseparable from one another, even if not absolutely one; this, too, is
a principle which he reasserts at the conclusion of the work. as in
the beginnings of plato's other writings, we have here several 'notes'
struck, which form the preludes of longer discussions, although the hint
is less ingeniously given, and the promise more imperfectly fulfilled
than in the earlier dialogues.

the distinction between ethics and politics has not yet dawned upon
plato's mind. to him, law is still floating in a region between the two.
he would have desired that all the acts and laws of a state should
have regard to all virtue. but he did not see that politics and law are
subject to their own conditions, and are distinguished from ethics by
natural differences. the actions of which politics take cognisance are
necessarily collective or representative; and law is limited to external
acts which affect others as well as the agents. ethics, on the other
hand, include the whole duty of man in relation both to himself and
others. but plato has never reflected on these differences. he fancies
that the life of the state can be as easily fashioned as that of the
individual. he is favourable to a balance of power, but never seems
to have considered that power might be so balanced as to produce an
absolute immobility in the state. nor is he alive to the evils
of confounding vice and crime; or to the necessity of governments
abstaining from excessive interference with their subjects.

yet this confusion of ethics and politics has also a better and a truer
side. if unable to grasp some important distinctions, plato is at any
rate seeking to elevate the lower to the higher; he does not pull down
the principles of men to their practice, or narrow the conception of
the state to the immediate necessities of politics. political ideals of
freedom and equality, of a divine government which has been or will be
in some other age or country, have greatly tended to educate and ennoble
the human race. and if not the first author of such ideals (for they are
as old as hesiod), plato has done more than any other writer to impress
them on the world. to those who censure his idealism we may reply in his
own words--'he is not the worse painter who draws a perfectly beautiful
figure, because no such figure of a man could ever have existed'
(republic).

a new thought about education suddenly occurs to him, and for a time
exercises a sort of fascination over his mind, though in the later books
of the laws it is forgotten or overlooked. as true courage is allied to
temperance, so there must be an education which shall train mankind to
resist pleasure as well as to endure pain. no one can be on his guard
against that of which he has no experience. the perfectly trained
citizen should have been accustomed to look his enemy in the face, and
to measure his strength against her. this education in pleasure is to be
given, partly by festive intercourse, but chiefly by the song and dance.
youth are to learn music and gymnastics; their elders are to be trained
and tested at drinking parties. according to the old proverb, in vino
veritas, they will then be open and visible to the world in their true
characters; and also they will be more amenable to the laws, and more
easily moulded by the hand of the legislator. the first reason is
curious enough, though not important; the second can hardly be thought
deserving of much attention. yet if plato means to say that society
is one of the principal instruments of education in after-life, he has
expressed in an obscure fashion a principle which is true, and to
his contemporaries was also new. that at a banquet a degree of moral
discipline might be exercised is an original thought, but plato has not
yet learnt to express his meaning in an abstract form. he is sensible
that moderation is better than total abstinence, and that asceticism is
but a one-sided training. he makes the sagacious remark, that 'those who
are able to resist pleasure may often be among the worst of mankind.' he
is as much aware as any modern utilitarian that the love of pleasure is
the great motive of human action. this cannot be eradicated, and must
therefore be regulated,--the pleasure must be of the right sort.
such reflections seem to be the real, though imperfectly expressed,
groundwork of the discussion. as in the juxtaposition of the bacchic
madness and the great gift of dionysus, or where he speaks of the
different senses in which pleasure is and is not the object of imitative
art, or in the illustration of the failure of the dorian institutions
from the prayer of theseus, we have to gather his meaning as well as we
can from the connexion.

the feeling of old age is discernible in this as well as in several
other passages of the laws. plato has arrived at the time when men sit
still and look on at life; and he is willing to allow himself and others
the few pleasures which remain to them. wine is to cheer them now that
their limbs are old and their blood runs cold. they are the best critics
of dancing and music, but cannot be induced to join in song unless they
have been enlivened by drinking. youth has no need of the stimulus
of wine, but age can only be made young again by its invigorating
influence. total abstinence for the young, moderate and increasing
potations for the old, is plato's principle. the fire, of which there is
too much in the one, has to be brought to the other. drunkenness, like
madness, had a sacredness and mystery to the greek; if, on the one hand,
as in the case of the tarentines, it degraded a whole population, it was
also a mode of worshipping the god dionysus, which was to be practised
on certain occasions. moreover, the intoxication produced by the fruit
of the vine was very different from the grosser forms of drunkenness
which prevail among some modern nations.

the physician in modern times would restrict the old man's use of wine
within narrow limits. he would tell us that you cannot restore strength
by a stimulus. wine may call back the vital powers in disease, but
cannot reinvigorate old age. in his maxims of health and longevity,
though aware of the importance of a simple diet, plato has omitted to
dwell on the perfect rule of moderation. his commendation of wine is
probably a passing fancy, and may have arisen out of his own habits
or tastes. if so, he is not the only philosopher whose theory has been
based upon his practice.

plato's denial of wine to the young and his approval of it for
their elders has some points of view which may be illustrated by the
temperance controversy of our own times. wine may be allowed to have a
religious as well as a festive use; it is commended both in the old and
new testament; it has been sung of by nearly all poets; and it may be
truly said to have a healing influence both on body and mind. yet it is
also very liable to excess and abuse, and for this reason is prohibited
by mahometans, as well as of late years by many christians, no less than
by the ancient spartans; and to sound its praises seriously seems to
partake of the nature of a paradox. but we may rejoin with plato that
the abuse of a good thing does not take away the use of it. total
abstinence, as we often say, is not the best rule, but moderate
indulgence; and it is probably true that a temperate use of wine may
contribute some elements of character to social life which we can ill
afford to lose. it draws men out of their reserve; it helps them to
forget themselves and to appear as they by nature are when not on their
guard, and therefore to make them more human and greater friends to
their fellow-men. it gives them a new experience; it teaches them to
combine self-control with a measure of indulgence; it may sometimes
restore to them the simplicity of childhood. we entirely agree with
plato in forbidding the use of wine to the young; but when we are
of mature age there are occasions on which we derive refreshment and
strength from moderate potations. it is well to make abstinence the
rule, but the rule may sometimes admit of an exception. we are in a
higher, as well as in a lower sense, the better for the use of wine.
the question runs up into wider ones--what is the general effect of
asceticism on human nature? and, must there not be a certain proportion
between the aspirations of man and his powers?--questions which have
been often discussed both by ancient and modern philosophers. so
by comparing things old and new we may sometimes help to realize to
ourselves the meaning of plato in the altered circumstances of our own
life.

like the importance which he attaches to festive entertainments, his
depreciation of courage to the fourth place in the scale of virtue
appears to be somewhat rhetorical and exaggerated. but he is speaking
of courage in the lower sense of the term, not as including loyalty or
temperance. he does not insist in this passage, as in the protagoras,
on the unity of the virtues; or, as in the laches, on the identity of
wisdom and courage. but he says that they all depend upon their leader
mind, and that, out of the union of wisdom and temperance with courage,
springs justice. elsewhere he is disposed to regard temperance rather
as a condition of all virtue than as a particular virtue. he generalizes
temperance, as in the republic he generalizes justice. the nature of the
virtues is to run up into one another, and in many passages plato makes
but a faint effort to distinguish them. he still quotes the poets,
somewhat enlarging, as his manner is, or playing with their meaning. the
martial poet tyrtaeus, and the oligarch theognis, furnish him with
happy illustrations of the two sorts of courage. the fear of fear, the
division of goods into human and divine, the acknowledgment that peace
and reconciliation are better than the appeal to the sword, the analysis
of temperance into resistance of pleasure as well as endurance of pain,
the distinction between the education which is suitable for a trade or
profession, and for the whole of life, are important and probably new
ethical conceptions. nor has plato forgotten his old paradox (gorgias)
that to be punished is better than to be unpunished, when he says, that
to the bad man death is the only mitigation of his evil. he is not less
ideal in many passages of the laws than in the gorgias or republic. but
his wings are heavy, and he is unequal to any sustained flight.

there is more attempt at dramatic effect in the first book than in
the later parts of the work. the outburst of martial spirit in the
lacedaemonian, 'o best of men'; the protest which the cretan makes
against the supposed insult to his lawgiver; the cordial acknowledgment
on the part of both of them that laws should not be discussed publicly
by those who live under their rule; the difficulty which they alike
experience in following the speculations of the athenian, are highly
characteristic.

in the second book, plato pursues further his notion of educating by
a right use of pleasure. he begins by conceiving an endless power of
youthful life, which is to be reduced to rule and measure by harmony and
rhythm. men differ from the lower animals in that they are capable of
musical discipline. but music, like all art, must be truly imitative,
and imitative of what is true and good. art and morality agree in
rejecting pleasure as the criterion of good. true art is inseparable
from the highest and most ennobling ideas. plato only recognizes the
identity of pleasure and good when the pleasure is of the higher kind.
he is the enemy of 'songs without words,' which he supposes to have some
confusing or enervating effect on the mind of the hearer; and he is also
opposed to the modern degeneracy of the drama, which he would probably
have illustrated, like aristophanes, from euripides and agathon. from
this passage may be gathered a more perfect conception of art than
from any other of plato's writings. he understands that art is at
once imitative and ideal, an exact representation of truth, and also a
representation of the highest truth. the same double view of art may be
gathered from a comparison of the third and tenth books of the republic,
but is here more clearly and pointedly expressed.

we are inclined to suspect that both here and in the republic plato
exaggerates the influence really exercised by the song and the dance.
but we must remember also the susceptible nature of the greek, and the
perfection to which these arts were carried by him. further, the music
had a sacred and pythagorean character; the dance too was part of a
religious festival. and only at such festivals the sexes mingled in
public, and the youths passed under the eyes of their elders.

at the beginning of the third book, plato abruptly asks the question,
what is the origin of states? the answer is, infinite time. we have
already seen--in the theaetetus, where he supposes that in the course of
ages every man has had numberless progenitors, kings and slaves, greeks
and barbarians; and in the critias, where he says that nine thousand
years have elapsed since the island of atlantis fought with athens--that
plato is no stranger to the conception of long periods of time. he
imagines human society to have been interrupted by natural convulsions;
and beginning from the last of these, he traces the steps by which the
family has grown into the state, and the original scattered society,
becoming more and more civilised, has finally passed into military
organizations like those of crete and sparta. his conception of the
origin of states is far truer in the laws than in the republic; but it
must be remembered that here he is giving an historical, there an ideal
picture of the growth of society.

modern enquirers, like plato, have found in infinite ages the
explanation not only of states, but of languages, men, animals, the
world itself; like him, also, they have detected in later institutions
the vestiges of a patriarchal state still surviving. thus far plato
speaks as 'the spectator of all time and all existence,' who may be
thought by some divine instinct to have guessed at truths which were
hereafter to be revealed. he is far above the vulgar notion that hellas
is the civilized world (statesman), or that civilization only began when
the hellenes appeared on the scene. but he has no special knowledge
of 'the days before the flood'; and when he approaches more historical
times, in preparing the way for his own theory of mixed government,
he argues partially and erroneously. he is desirous of showing that
unlimited power is ruinous to any state, and hence he is led to
attribute a tyrannical spirit to the first dorian kings. the decay of
argos and the destruction of messene are adduced by him as a manifest
proof of their failure; and sparta, he thinks, was only preserved by the
limitations which the wisdom of successive legislators introduced into
the government. but there is no more reason to suppose that the dorian
rule of life which was followed at sparta ever prevailed in argos and
messene, than to assume that dorian institutions were framed to protect
the greeks against the power of assyria; or that the empire of assyria
was in any way affected by the trojan war; or that the return of the
heraclidae was only the return of achaean exiles, who received a new
name from their leader dorieus. such fancies were chiefly based, as far
as they had any foundation, on the use of analogy, which played a great
part in the dawn of historical and geographical research. because there
was a persian empire which was the natural enemy of the greek, there
must also have been an assyrian empire, which had a similar hostility;
and not only the fable of the island of atlantis, but the trojan war,
in plato's mind derived some features from the persian struggle. so
herodotus makes the nile answer to the ister, and the valley of the nile
to the red sea. in the republic, plato is flying in the air regardless
of fact and possibility--in the laws, he is making history by analogy.
in the former, he appears to be like some modern philosophers,
absolutely devoid of historical sense; in the latter, he is on a level,
not with thucydides, or the critical historians of greece, but with
herodotus, or even with ctesias.

the chief object of plato in tracing the origin of society is to show
the point at which regular government superseded the patriarchical
authority, and the separate customs of different families were
systematized by legislators, and took the form of laws consented to
by them all. according to plato, the only sound principle on which any
government could be based was a mixture or balance of power. the balance
of power saved sparta, when the two other heraclid states fell into
disorder. here is probably the first trace of a political idea, which
has exercised a vast influence both in ancient and modern times. and
yet we might fairly ask, a little parodying the language of plato--o
legislator, is unanimity only 'the struggle for existence'; or is the
balance of powers in a state better than the harmony of them?

in the fourth book we approach the realities of politics, and plato
begins to ascend to the height of his great argument. the reign of
cronos has passed away, and various forms of government have succeeded,
which are all based on self-interest and self-preservation. right and
wrong, instead of being measured by the will of god, are created by
the law of the state. the strongest assertions are made of the purely
spiritual nature of religion--'without holiness no man is accepted of
god'; and of the duty of filial obedience,--'honour thy parents.' the
legislator must teach these precepts as well as command them. he is to
be the educator as well as the lawgiver of future ages, and his laws
are themselves to form a part of the education of the state. unlike the
poet, he must be definite and rational; he cannot be allowed to say one
thing at one time, and another thing at another--he must know what he
is about. and yet legislation has a poetical or rhetorical element, and
must find words which will wing their way to the hearts of men. laws
must be promulgated before they are put in execution, and mankind must
be reasoned with before they are punished. the legislator, when he
promulgates a particular law, will courteously entreat those who are
willing to hear his voice. upon the rebellious only does the heavy blow
descend. a sermon and a law in one, blending the secular punishment with
the religious sanction, appeared to plato a new idea which might have a
great result in reforming the world. the experiment had never been
tried of reasoning with mankind; the laws of others had never had any
preambles, and plato seems to have great pleasure in contemplating his
discovery.

in these quaint forms of thought and language, great principles of
morals and legislation are enunciated by him for the first time. they
all go back to mind and god, who holds the beginning, middle, and end of
all things in his hand. the adjustment of the divine and human elements
in the world is conceived in the spirit of modern popular philosophy,
differing not much in the mode of expression. at first sight the
legislator appears to be impotent, for all things are the sport of
chance. but we admit also that god governs all things, and that chance
and opportunity co-operate with him (compare the saying, that chance is
the name of the unknown cause). lastly, while we acknowledge that god
and chance govern mankind and provide the conditions of human action,
experience will not allow us to deny a place to art. we know that there
is a use in having a pilot, though the storm may overwhelm him; and a
legislator is required to provide for the happiness of a state, although
he will pray for favourable conditions under which he may exercise his
art.

book v. hear now, all ye who heard the laws about gods and ancestors:
of all human possessions the soul is most divine, and most truly a man's
own. for in every man there are two parts--a better which rules, and an
inferior which serves; and the ruler is to be preferred to the servant.
wherefore i bid every one next after the gods to honour his own soul,
and he can only honour her by making her better. a man does not honour
his soul by flattery, or gifts, or self-indulgence, or conceit of
knowledge, nor when he blames others for his own errors; nor when he
indulges in pleasure or refuses to bear pain; nor when he thinks that
life at any price is a good, because he fears the world below, which,
far from being an evil, may be the greatest good; nor when he prefers
beauty to virtue--not reflecting that the soul, which came from heaven,
is more honourable than the body, which is earth-born; nor when
he covets dishonest gains, of which no amount is equal in value to
virtue;--in a word, when he counts that which the legislator pronounces
evil to be good, he degrades his soul, which is the divinest part of
him. he does not consider that the real punishment of evil-doing is to
grow like evil men, and to shun the conversation of the good: and that
he who is joined to such men must do and suffer what they by nature do
and say to one another, which suffering is not justice but retribution.
for justice is noble, but retribution is only the companion of
injustice. and whether a man escapes punishment or not, he is equally
miserable; for in the one case he is not cured, and in the other case he
perishes that the rest may be saved.

the glory of man is to follow the better and improve the inferior. and
the soul is that part of man which is most inclined to avoid the evil
and dwell with the good. wherefore also the soul is second only to the
gods in honour, and in the third place the body is to be esteemed, which
often has a false honour. for honour is not to be given to the fair or
the strong, or the swift or the tall, or to the healthy, any more than
to their opposites, but to the mean states of all these habits; and so
of property and external goods. no man should heap up riches that he may
leave them to his children. the best condition for them as for the state
is a middle one, in which there is a freedom without luxury. and the
best inheritance of children is modesty. but modesty cannot be implanted
by admonition only--the elders must set the example. he who would train
the young must first train himself.

he who honours his kindred and family may fairly expect that the gods
will give him children. he who would have friends must think much of
their favours to him, and little of his to them. he who prefers to an
olympic, or any other victory, to win the palm of obedience to the laws,
serves best both the state and his fellow-citizens. engagements with
strangers are to be deemed most sacred, because the stranger, having
neither kindred nor friends, is immediately under the protection of
zeus, the god of strangers. a prudent man will not sin against the
stranger; and still more carefully will he avoid sinning against the
suppliant, which is an offence never passed over by the gods.

i will now speak of those particulars which are matters of praise and
blame only, and which, although not enforced by the law, greatly affect
the disposition to obey the law. truth has the first place among the
gifts of gods and men, for truth begets trust; but he is not to be
trusted who loves voluntary falsehood, and he who loves involuntary
falsehood is a fool. neither the ignorant nor the untrustworthy man
is happy; for they have no friends in life, and die unlamented and
untended. good is he who does no injustice--better who prevents others
from doing any--best of all who joins the rulers in punishing injustice.
and this is true of goods and virtues in general; he who has and
communicates them to others is the man of men; he who would, if he
could, is second-best; he who has them and is jealous of imparting them
to others is to be blamed, but the good or virtue which he has is to be
valued still. let every man contend in the race without envy; for the
unenvious man increases the strength of the city; himself foremost in
the race, he harms no one with calumny. whereas the envious man is
weak himself, and drives his rivals to despair with his slanders, thus
depriving the whole city of incentives to the exercise of virtue, and
tarnishing her glory. every man should be gentle, but also passionate;
for he must have the spirit to fight against incurable and malignant
evil. but the evil which is remediable should be dealt with more in
sorrow than anger. he who is unjust is to be pitied in any case; for
no man voluntarily does evil or allows evil to exist in his soul. and
therefore he who deals with the curable sort must be long-suffering and
forbearing; but the incurable shall have the vials of our wrath poured
out upon him. the greatest of all evils is self-love, which is thought
to be natural and excusable, and is enforced as a duty, and yet is
the cause of many errors. the lover is blinded about the beloved, and
prefers his own interests to truth and right; but the truly great
man seeks justice before all things. self-love is the source of
that ignorant conceit of knowledge which is always doing and never
succeeding. wherefore let every man avoid self-love, and follow the
guidance of those who are better than himself. there are lesser matters
which a man should recall to mind; for wisdom is like a stream, ever
flowing in and out, and recollection flows in when knowledge is failing.
let no man either laugh or grieve overmuch; but let him control his
feelings in the day of good- or ill-fortune, believing that the gods
will diminish the evils and increase the blessings of the righteous.
these are thoughts which should ever occupy a good man's mind; he should
remember them both in lighter and in more serious hours, and remind
others of them.

so much of divine matters and the relation of man to god. but man is
man, and dependent on pleasure and pain; and therefore to acquire a true
taste respecting either is a great matter. and what is a true taste?
this can only be explained by a comparison of one life with another.
pleasure is an object of desire, pain of avoidance; and the absence of
pain is to be preferred to pain, but not to pleasure. there are infinite
kinds and degrees of both of them, and we choose the life which has more
pleasure and avoid that which has less; but we do not choose that life
in which the elements of pleasure are either feeble or equally balanced
with pain. all the lives which we desire are pleasant; the choice of any
others is due to inexperience.

now there are four lives--the temperate, the rational, the courageous,
the healthful; and to these let us oppose four others--the intemperate,
the foolish, the cowardly, the diseased. the temperate life has gentle
pains and pleasures and placid desires, the intemperate life has violent
delights, and still more violent desires. and the pleasures of the
temperate exceed the pains, while the pains of the intemperate exceed
the pleasures. but if this is true, none are voluntarily intemperate,
but all who lack temperance are either ignorant or wanting in
self-control: for men always choose the life which (as they think)
exceeds in pleasure. the wise, the healthful, the courageous life have
a similar advantage--they also exceed their opposites in pleasure.
and, generally speaking, the life of virtue is far more pleasurable and
honourable, fairer and happier far, than the life of vice. let this be
the preamble of our laws; the strain will follow.

as in a web the warp is stronger than the woof, so should the rulers be
stronger than their half-educated subjects. let us suppose, then, that
in the constitution of a state there are two parts, the appointment
of the rulers, and the laws which they have to administer. but, before
going further, there are some preliminary matters which have to be
considered.

as of animals, so also of men, a selection must be made; the bad breed
must be got rid of, and the good retained. the legislator must purify
them, and if he be not a despot he will find this task to be a difficult
one. the severer kinds of purification are practised when great
offenders are punished by death or exile, but there is a milder process
which is necessary when the poor show a disposition to attack the
property of the rich, for then the legislator will send them off to
another land, under the name of a colony. in our case, however, we
shall only need to purify the streams before they meet. this is often
a troublesome business, but in theory we may suppose the operation
performed, and the desired purity attained. evil men we will hinder from
coming, and receive the good as friends.

like the old heraclid colony, we are fortunate in escaping the abolition
of debts and the distribution of land, which are difficult and dangerous
questions. but, perhaps, now that we are speaking of the subject, we
ought to say how, if the danger existed, the legislator should try to
avert it. he would have recourse to prayers, and trust to the healing
influence of time. he would create a kindly spirit between creditors and
debtors: those who have should give to those who have not, and poverty
should be held to be rather the increase of a man's desires than the
diminution of his property. good-will is the only safe and enduring
foundation of the political society; and upon this our city shall
be built. the lawgiver, if he is wise, will not proceed with the
arrangement of the state until all disputes about property are settled.
and for him to introduce fresh grounds of quarrel would be madness.

let us now proceed to the distribution of our state, and determine the
size of the territory and the number of the allotments. the territory
should be sufficient to maintain the citizens in moderation, and the
population should be numerous enough to defend themselves, and sometimes
to aid their neighbours. we will fix the number of citizens at 5040, to
which the number of houses and portions of land shall correspond. let
the number be divided into two parts and then into three; for it is
very convenient for the purposes of distribution, and is capable of
fifty-nine divisions, ten of which proceed without interval from one to
ten. here are numbers enough for war and peace, and for all contracts
and dealings. these properties of numbers are true, and should be
ascertained with a view to use.

in carrying out the distribution of the land, a prudent legislator will
be careful to respect any provision for religious worship which has been
sanctioned by ancient tradition or by the oracles of delphi, dodona, or
ammon. all sacrifices, and altars, and temples, whatever may be their
origin, should remain as they are. every division should have a patron
god or hero; to these a portion of the domain should be appropriated,
and at their temples the inhabitants of the districts should meet
together from time to time, for the sake of mutual help and friendship.
all the citizens of a state should be known to one another; for where
men are in the dark about each other's characters, there can be
no justice or right administration. every man should be true and
single-minded, and should not allow himself to be deceived by others.

and now the game opens, and we begin to move the pieces. at first sight,
our constitution may appear singular and ill-adapted to a legislator who
has not despotic power; but on second thoughts will be deemed to be,
if not the very best, the second best. for there are three forms of
government, a first, a second, and a third best, out of which cleinias
has now to choose. the first and highest form is that in which friends
have all things in common, including wives and property,--in which they
have common fears, hopes, desires, and do not even call their eyes or
their hands their own. this is the ideal state; than which there never
can be a truer or better--a state, whether inhabited by gods or sons of
gods, which will make the dwellers therein blessed. here is the pattern
on which we must ever fix our eyes; but we are now concerned with
another, which comes next to it, and we will afterwards proceed to a
third.

inasmuch as our citizens are not fitted either by nature or education to
receive the saying, friends have all things in common, let them retain
their houses and private property, but use them in the service of their
country, who is their god and parent, and of the gods and demigods of
the land. their first care should be to preserve the number of their
lots. this may be secured in the following manner: when the possessor of
a lot dies, he shall leave his lot to his best-beloved child, who will
become the heir of all duties and interests, and will minister to the
gods and to the family, to the living and to the dead. of the remaining
children, the females must be given in marriage according to the law to
be hereafter enacted; the males may be assigned to citizens who have no
children of their own. how to equalize families and allotments will be
one of the chief cares of the guardians of the laws. when parents have
too many children they may give to those who have none, or couples
may abstain from having children, or, if there is a want of offspring,
special care may be taken to obtain them; or if the number of citizens
becomes excessive, we may send away the surplus to found a colony. if,
on the other hand, a war or plague diminishes the number of inhabitants,
new citizens must be introduced; and these ought not, if possible, to be
men of low birth or inferior training; but even god, it is said, cannot
always fight against necessity.

wherefore we will thus address our citizens:--good friends, honour
order and equality, and above all the number 5040. secondly, respect the
original division of the lots, which must not be infringed by buying and
selling, for the law says that the land which a man has is sacred and
is given to him by god. and priests and priestesses will offer frequent
sacrifices and pray that he who alienates either house or lot may
receive the punishment which he deserves, and their prayers shall be
inscribed on tablets of cypress-wood for the instruction of posterity.
the guardians will keep a vigilant watch over the citizens, and they
will punish those who disobey god and the law.

to appreciate the benefit of such an institution a man requires to be
well educated; for he certainly will not make a fortune in our state, in
which all illiberal occupations are forbidden to freemen. the law also
provides that no private person shall have gold or silver, except
a little coin for daily use, which will not pass current in other
countries. the state must also possess a common hellenic currency, but
this is only to be used in defraying the expenses of expeditions, or of
embassies, or while a man is on foreign travels; but in the latter case
he must deliver up what is over, when he comes back, to the treasury in
return for an equal amount of local currency, on pain of losing the sum
in question; and he who does not inform against an offender is to be
mulcted in a like sum. no money is to be given or taken as a dowry, or
to be lent on interest. the law will not protect a man in recovering
either interest or principal. all these regulations imply that the
aim of the legislator is not to make the city as rich or as mighty as
possible, but the best and happiest. now men can hardly be at the same
time very virtuous and very rich. and why? because he who makes twice as
much and saves twice as much as he ought, receiving where he ought not
and not spending where he ought, will be at least twice as rich as he
who makes money where he ought, and spends where he ought. on the other
hand, an utterly bad man is generally profligate and poor, while he who
acquires honestly, and spends what he acquires on noble objects, can
hardly be very rich. a very rich man is therefore not a good man, and
therefore not a happy one. but the object of our laws is to make the
citizens as friendly and happy as possible, which they cannot be if they
are always at law and injuring each other in the pursuit of gain. and
therefore we say that there is to be no silver or gold in the state,
nor usury, nor the rearing of the meaner kinds of live-stock, but only
agriculture, and only so much of this as will not lead men to neglect
that for the sake of which money is made, first the soul and afterwards
the body; neither of which are good for much without music and
gymnastic. money is to be held in honour last or third; the highest
interests being those of the soul, and in the second class are to be
ranked those of the body. this is the true order of legislation, which
would be inverted by placing health before temperance, and wealth before
health.

it might be well if every man could come to the colony having equal
property; but equality is impossible, and therefore we must avoid causes
of offence by having property valued and by equalizing taxation. to
this end, let us make four classes in which the citizens may be placed
according to the measure of their original property, and the changes of
their fortune. the greatest of evils is revolution; and this, as the
law will say, is caused by extremes of poverty or wealth. the limit
of poverty shall be the lot, which must not be diminished, and may be
increased fivefold, but not more. he who exceeds the limit must give up
the excess to the state; but if he does not, and is informed against,
the surplus shall be divided between the informer and the gods, and
he shall pay a sum equal to the surplus out of his own property. all
property other than the lot must be inscribed in a register, so that any
disputes which arise may be easily determined.

the city shall be placed in a suitable situation, as nearly as possible
in the centre of the country, and shall be divided into twelve wards.
first, we will erect an acropolis, encircled by a wall, within which
shall be placed the temples of hestia, and zeus, and athene. from this
shall be drawn lines dividing the city, and also the country, into
twelve sections, and the country shall be subdivided into 5040 lots.
each lot shall contain two parts, one at a distance, the other near the
city; and the distance of one part shall be compensated by the nearness
of the other, the badness and goodness by the greater or less size.
twelve lots will be assigned to twelve gods, and they will give their
names to the tribes. the divisions of the city shall correspond to those
of the country; and every man shall have two habitations, one near the
centre of the country, the other at the extremity.

the objection will naturally arise, that all the advantages of which we
have been speaking will never concur. the citizens will not tolerate a
settlement in which they are deprived of gold and silver, and have the
number of their families regulated, and the sites of their houses fixed
by law. it will be said that our city is a mere image of wax. and the
legislator will answer: 'i know it, but i maintain that we ought to set
forth an ideal which is as perfect as possible. if difficulties arise
in the execution of the plan, we must avoid them and carry out the
remainder. but the legislator must first be allowed to complete his idea
without interruption.'

the number twelve, which we have chosen for the number of division,
must run through all parts of the state,--phratries, villages, ranks
of soldiers, coins, and measures wet and dry, which are all to be made
commensurable with one another. there is no meanness in requiring that
the smallest vessels should have a common measure; for the divisions of
number are useful in measuring height and depth, as well as sounds and
motions, upwards or downwards, or round and round. the legislator
should impress on his citizens the value of arithmetic. no instrument of
education has so much power; nothing more tends to sharpen and inspire
the dull intellect. but the legislator must be careful to instil a
noble and generous spirit into the students, or they will tend to become
cunning rather than wise. this may be proved by the example of the
egyptians and phoenicians, who, notwithstanding their knowledge of
arithmetic, are degraded in their general character; whether this defect
in them is due to some natural cause or to a bad legislator. for it
is clear that there are great differences in the power of regions to
produce good men: heat and cold, and water and food, have great effects
both on body and soul; and those spots are peculiarly fortunate in which
the air is holy, and the gods are pleased to dwell. to all this the
legislator must attend, so far as in him lies.

book vi. and now we are about to consider (1) the appointment of
magistrates; (2) the laws which they will have to administer must
be determined. i may observe by the way that laws, however good,
are useless and even injurious unless the magistrates are capable of
executing them. and therefore (1) the intended rulers of our imaginary
state should be tested from their youth upwards until the time of their
election; and (2) those who are to elect them ought to be trained in
habits of law, that they may form a right judgment of good and bad men.
but uneducated colonists, who are unacquainted with each other, will not
be likely to choose well. what, then, shall we do? i will tell you: the
colony will have to be intrusted to the ten commissioners, of whom you
are one, and i will help you and them, which is my reason for inventing
this romance. and i cannot bear that the tale should go wandering about
the world without a head,--it will be such an ugly monster. 'very good.'
yes; and i will be as good as my word, if god be gracious and old age
permit. but let us not forget what a courageously mad creation this our
city is. 'what makes you say so?' why, surely our courage is shown in
imagining that the new colonists will quietly receive our laws? for no
man likes to receive laws when they are first imposed: could we only
wait until those who had been educated under them were grown up, and
of an age to vote in the public elections, there would be far greater
reason to expect permanence in our institutions. 'very true.' the
cnosian founders should take the utmost pains in the matter of the
colony, and in the election of the higher officers, particularly of the
guardians of the law. the latter should be appointed in this way: the
cnosians, who take the lead in the colony, together with the colonists,
will choose thirty-seven persons, of whom nineteen will be colonists,
and the remaining eighteen cnosians--you must be one of the eighteen
yourself, and become a citizen of the new state. 'why do not you and
megillus join us?' athens is proud, and sparta too; and they are both
a long way off. but let me proceed with my scheme. when the state is
permanently established, the mode of election will be as follows: all
who are serving, or have served, in the army will be electors; and the
election will be held in the most sacred of the temples. the voter
will place on the altar a tablet, inscribing thereupon the name of the
candidate whom he prefers, and of his father, tribe, and ward, writing
at the side of them his own name in like manner; and he may take away
any tablet which does not appear written to his mind, and place it in
the agora for thirty days. the 300 who obtain the greatest number of
votes will be publicly announced, and out of them there will be a
second election of 100; and out of the 100 a third and final election
of thirty-seven, accompanied by the solemnity of the electors passing
through victims. but then who is to arrange all this? there is a common
saying, that the beginning is half the whole; and i should say a good
deal more than half. 'most true.' the only way of making a beginning is
from the parent city; and though in after ages the tie may be broken,
and quarrels may arise between them, yet in early days the child
naturally looks to the mother for care and education. and, as i said
before, the cnosians ought to take an interest in the colony, and select
100 elders of their own citizens, to whom shall be added 100 of the
colonists, to arrange and supervise the first elections and scrutinies;
and when the colony has been started, the cnosians may return home and
leave the colonists to themselves.

the thirty-seven magistrates who have been elected in the manner
described, shall have the following duties: first, they shall be
guardians of the law; secondly, of the registers of property in the
four classes--not including the one, two, three, four minae, which are
allowed as a surplus. he who is found to possess what is not entered in
the registers, in addition to the confiscation of such property shall be
proceeded against by law, and if he be cast he shall lose his share
in the public property and in distributions of money; and his sentence
shall be inscribed in some public place. the guardians are to continue
in office twenty years only, and to commence holding office at fifty
years, or if elected at sixty they are not to remain after seventy.

generals have now to be elected, and commanders of horse and brigadiers
of foot. the generals shall be natives of the city, proposed by the
guardians of the law, and elected by those who are or have been of the
age for military service. any one may challenge the person nominated
and start another candidate, whom he affirms upon oath to be better
qualified. the three who obtain the greatest number of votes shall
be elected. the generals thus elected shall propose the taxiarchs or
brigadiers, and the challenge may be made, and the voting shall take
place, in the same manner as before. the elective assembly will be
presided over in the first instance, and until the prytanes and council
come into being, by the guardians of the law in some holy place; and
they shall divide the citizens into three divisions,--hoplites, cavalry,
and the rest of the army--placing each of them by itself. all are to
vote for generals and cavalry officers. the brigadiers are to be voted
for only by the hoplites. next, the cavalry are to choose phylarchs for
the generals; but captains of archers and other irregular troops are to
be appointed by the generals themselves. the cavalry-officers shall be
proposed and voted upon by the same persons who vote for the generals.
the two who have the greatest number of votes shall be leaders of all
the horse. disputes about the voting may be raised once or twice, but,
if a third time, the presiding officers shall decide.

the council shall consist of 360, who may be conveniently divided into
four sections, making ninety councillors of each class. in the first
place, all the citizens shall select candidates from the first class;
and they shall be compelled to vote under pain of a fine. this shall
be the business of the first day. on the second day a similar selection
shall be made from the second class under the same conditions. on the
third day, candidates shall be selected from the third class; but the
compulsion to vote shall only extend to the voters of the first three
classes. on the fourth day, members of the council shall be selected
from the fourth class; they shall be selected by all, but the compulsion
to vote shall only extend to the second class, who, if they do not vote,
shall pay a fine of triple the amount which was exacted at first, and to
the first class, who shall pay a quadruple fine. on the fifth day, the
names shall be exhibited, and out of them shall be chosen by all the
citizens 180 of each class: these are severally to be reduced by lot to
ninety, and 90 x 4 will form the council for the year.

the mode of election which has been described is a mean between monarchy
and democracy, and such a mean should ever be observed in the state.
for servants and masters cannot be friends, and, although equality makes
friendship, we must remember that there are two sorts of equality. one
of them is the rule of number and measure; but there is also a higher
equality, which is the judgment of zeus. of this he grants but little to
mortal men; yet that little is the source of the greatest good to cities
and individuals. it is proportioned to the nature of each man; it gives
more to the better and less to the inferior, and is the true political
justice; to this we in our state desire to look, as every legislator
should, not to the interests either of tyrants or mobs. but justice
cannot always be strictly enforced, and then equity and mercy have to
be substituted: and for a similar reason, when true justice will not be
endured, we must have recourse to the rougher justice of the lot, which
god must be entreated to guide.

these are the principal means of preserving the state, but perpetual
care will also be required. when a ship is sailing on the sea, vigilance
must not be relaxed night or day; and the vessel of state is tossing in
a political sea, and therefore watch must continually succeed watch, and
rulers must join hands with rulers. a small body will best perform
this duty, and therefore the greater part of the 360 senators may be
permitted to go and manage their own affairs, but a twelfth portion must
be set aside in each month for the administration of the state. their
business will be to receive information and answer embassies; also they
must endeavour to prevent or heal internal disorders; and with this
object they must have the control of all assemblies of the citizens.

besides the council, there must be wardens of the city and of the agora,
who will superintend houses, ways, harbours, markets, and fountains, in
the city and the suburbs, and prevent any injury being done to them by
man or beast. the temples, also, will require priests and priestesses.
those who hold the priestly office by hereditary tenure shall not be
disturbed; but as there will probably be few or none such in a new
colony, priests and priestesses shall be appointed for the gods who have
no servants. some of these officers shall be elected by vote, some by
lot; and all classes shall mingle in a friendly manner at the elections.
the appointment of priests should be left to god,--that is, to the lot;
but the person elected must prove that he is himself sound in body and
of legitimate birth, and that his family has been free from homicide or
any other stain of impurity. priests and priestesses are to be not less
than sixty years of age, and shall hold office for a year only. the laws
which are to regulate matters of religion shall be brought from delphi,
and interpreters appointed to superintend their execution. these shall
be elected in the following manner:--the twelve tribes shall be formed
into three bodies of four, each of which shall select four candidates,
and this shall be done three times: of each twelve thus selected the
three who receive the largest number of votes, nine in all, after
undergoing a scrutiny shall go to delphi, in order that the god may
elect one out of each triad. they shall be appointed for life; and when
any of them dies, another shall be elected by the four tribes who made
the original appointment. there shall also be treasurers of the temples;
three for the greater temples, two for the lesser, and one for those of
least importance.

the defence of the city should be committed to the generals and other
officers of the army, and to the wardens of the city and agora. the
defence of the country shall be on this wise:--the twelve tribes shall
allot among themselves annually the twelve divisions of the country, and
each tribe shall appoint five wardens and commanders of the watch. the
five wardens in each division shall choose out of their own tribe twelve
guards, who are to be between twenty-five and thirty years of age. both
the wardens and the guards are to serve two years; and they shall make a
round of the divisions, staying a month in each. they shall go from west
to east during the first year, and back from east to west during the
second. thus they will gain a perfect knowledge of the country at every
season of the year.

while on service, their first duty will be to see that the country is
well protected by means of fortifications and entrenchments; they will
use the beasts of burden and the labourers whom they find on the
spot, taking care however not to interfere with the regular course of
agriculture. but while they thus render the country as inaccessible as
possible to enemies, they will also make it as accessible as possible to
friends by constructing and maintaining good roads. they will restrain
and preserve the rain which comes down from heaven, making the barren
places fertile, and the wet places dry. they will ornament the fountains
with plantations and buildings, and provide water for irrigation at
all seasons of the year. they will lead the streams to the temples and
groves of the gods; and in such spots the youth shall make gymnasia for
themselves, and warm baths for the aged; there the rustic worn with toil
will receive a kindly welcome, and be far better treated than at the
hands of an unskilful doctor.

these works will be both useful and ornamental; but the sixty wardens
must not fail to give serious attention to other duties. for they must
watch over the districts assigned to them, and also act as judges. in
small matters the five commanders shall decide: in greater matters up to
three minae, the five commanders and the twelve guards. like all other
judges, except those who have the final decision, they shall be liable
to give an account. if the wardens impose unjust tasks on the villagers,
or take by force their crops or implements, or yield to flattery or
bribes in deciding suits, let them be publicly dishonoured. in regard to
any other wrong-doing, if the question be of a mina, let the neighbours
decide; but if the accused person will not submit, trusting that his
monthly removals will enable him to escape payment, and also in suits
about a larger amount, the injured party may have recourse to the common
court; in the former case, if successful, he may exact a double penalty.

the wardens and guards, while on their two years' service, shall live
and eat together, and the guard who is absent from the daily meals
without permission or sleeps out at night, shall be regarded as a
deserter, and may be punished by any one who meets him. if any of the
commanders is guilty of such an irregularity, the whole sixty shall
have him punished; and he of them who screens him shall suffer a still
heavier penalty than the offender himself. now by service a man learns
to rule; and he should pride himself upon serving well the laws and the
gods all his life, and upon having served ancient and honourable men in
his youth. the twelve and the five should be their own servants, and use
the labour of the villagers only for the good of the public. let them
search the country through, and acquire a perfect knowledge of every
locality; with this view, hunting and field sports should be encouraged.

next we have to speak of the elections of the wardens of the agora and
of the city. the wardens of the city shall be three in number, and they
shall have the care of the streets, roads, buildings, and also of the
water-supply. they shall be chosen out of the highest class, and when
the number of candidates has been reduced to six who have the greatest
number of votes, three out of the six shall be taken by lot, and, after
a scrutiny, shall be admitted to their office. the wardens of the agora
shall be five in number--ten are to be first elected, and every one
shall vote for all the vacant places; the ten shall be afterwards
reduced to five by lot, as in the former election. the first and second
class shall be compelled to go to the assembly, but not the third and
fourth, unless they are specially summoned. the wardens of the agora
shall have the care of the temples and fountains which are in the agora,
and shall punish those who injure them by stripes and bonds, if they be
slaves or strangers; and by fines, if they be citizens. and the wardens
of the city shall have a similar power of inflicting punishment and
fines in their own department.

in the next place, there must be directors of music and gymnastic; one
class of them superintending gymnasia and schools, and the attendance
and lodging of the boys and girls--the other having to do with contests
of music and gymnastic. in musical contests there shall be one kind
of judges of solo singing or playing, who will judge of rhapsodists,
flute-players, harp-players and the like, and another of choruses. there
shall be choruses of men and boys and maidens--one director will be
enough to introduce them all, and he should not be less than forty years
of age; secondly, of solos also there shall be one director, aged not
less than thirty years; he will introduce the competitors and give
judgment upon them. the director of the choruses is to be elected in
an assembly at which all who take an interest in music are compelled
to attend, and no one else. candidates must only be proposed for their
fitness, and opposed on the ground of unfitness. ten are to be elected
by vote, and the one of these on whom the lot falls shall be director
for a year. next shall be elected out of the second and third classes
the judges of gymnastic contests, who are to be three in number, and
are to be tested, after being chosen by lot out of twenty who have been
elected by the three highest classes--these being compelled to attend at
the election.

one minister remains, who will have the general superintendence of
education. he must be not less than fifty years old, and be himself the
father of children born in wedlock. his office must be regarded by all
as the highest in the state. for the right growth of the first shoot
in plants and animals is the chief cause of matured perfection. man is
supposed to be a tame animal, but he becomes either the gentlest or
the fiercest of creatures, accordingly as he is well or ill educated.
wherefore he who is elected to preside over education should be the best
man possible. he shall hold office for five years, and shall be elected
out of the guardians of the law, by the votes of the other magistrates
with the exception of the senate and prytanes; and the election shall be
held by ballot in the temple of apollo.

when a magistrate dies before his term of office has expired, another
shall be elected in his place; and, if the guardian of an orphan dies,
the relations shall appoint another within ten days, or be fined a
drachma a day for neglect.

the city which has no courts of law will soon cease to be a city; and a
judge who sits in silence and leaves the enquiry to the litigants, as
in arbitrations, is not a good judge. a few judges are better than
many, but the few must be good. the matter in dispute should be clearly
elicited; time and examination will find out the truth. causes should
first be tried before a court of neighbours: if the decision is
unsatisfactory, let them be referred to a higher court; or, if
necessary, to a higher still, of which the decision shall be final.

every magistrate is a judge, and every judge is a magistrate, on the day
on which he is deciding the suit. this will therefore be an appropriate
place to speak of judges and their functions. the supreme tribunal
will be that on which the litigants agree; and let there be two other
tribunals, one for public and the other for private causes. the high
court of appeal shall be composed as follows:--all the officers of
state shall meet on the last day but one of the year in some temple, and
choose for a judge the best man out of every magistracy: and those who
are elected, after they have undergone a scrutiny, shall be judges of
appeal. they shall give their decisions openly, in the presence of the
magistrates who have elected them; and the public may attend. if anybody
charges one of them with having intentionally decided wrong, he shall
lay his accusation before the guardians of the law, and if the judge
be found guilty he shall pay damages to the extent of half the injury,
unless the guardians of the law deem that he deserves a severer
punishment, in which case the judges shall assess the penalty.

as the whole people are injured by offences against the state, they
should share in the trial of them. such causes should originate with the
people and be decided by them: the enquiry shall take place before any
three of the highest magistrates upon whom the defendant and plaintiff
can agree. also in private suits all should judge as far as possible,
and therefore there should be a court of law in every ward; for he who
has no share in the administration of justice, believes that he has no
share in the state. the judges in these courts shall be elected by lot
and give their decision at once. the final judgment in all cases shall
rest with the court of appeal. and so, having done with the appointment
of courts and the election of officers, we will now make our laws.

'your way of proceeding, stranger, is admirable.'

then so far our old man's game of play has gone off well.

'say, rather, our serious and noble pursuit.'

perhaps; but let me ask you whether you have ever observed the manner in
which painters put in and rub out colour: yet their endless labour will
last but a short time, unless they leave behind them some successor who
will restore the picture and remove its defects. 'certainly.' and have
we not a similar object at the present moment? we are old ourselves,
and therefore we must leave our work of legislation to be improved
and perfected by the next generation; not only making laws for our
guardians, but making them lawgivers. 'we must at least do our best.'
let us address them as follows. beloved saviours of the laws, we give
you an outline of legislation which you must fill up, according to a
rule which we will prescribe for you. megillus and cleinias and i are
agreed, and we hope that you will agree with us in thinking, that the
whole energies of a man should be devoted to the attainment of manly
virtue, whether this is to be gained by study, or habit, or desire, or
opinion. and rather than accept institutions which tend to degrade and
enslave him, he should fly his country and endure any hardship. these
are our principles, and we would ask you to judge of our laws, and
praise or blame them, accordingly as they are or are not capable of
improving our citizens.

and first of laws concerning religion. we have already said that the
number 5040 has many convenient divisions: and we took a twelfth part of
this (420), which is itself divisible by twelve, for the number of the
tribe. every divisor is a gift of god, and corresponds to the months
of the year and to the revolution of the universe. all cities have a
number, but none is more fortunate than our own, which can be divided by
all numbers up to 12, with the exception of 11, and even by 11, if two
families are deducted. and now let us divide the state, assigning to
each division some god or demigod, who shall have altars raised to them,
and sacrifices offered twice a month; and assemblies shall be held
in their honour, twelve for the tribes, and twelve for the city,
corresponding to their divisions. the object of them will be first
to promote religion, secondly to encourage friendship and intercourse
between families; for families must be acquainted before they marry
into one another, or great mistakes will occur. at these festivals there
shall be innocent dances of young men and maidens, who may have the
opportunity of seeing one another in modest undress. to the details
of all this the masters of choruses and the guardians will attend,
embodying in laws the results of their experience; and, after ten years,
making the laws permanent, with the consent of the legislator, if he be
alive, or, if he be not alive, of the guardians of the law, who shall
perfect them and settle them once for all. at least, if any further
changes are required, the magistrates must take the whole people into
counsel, and obtain the sanction of all the oracles.

whenever any one who is between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five
wants to marry, let him do so; but first let him hear the strain which
we will address to him:--

my son, you ought to marry, but not in order to gain wealth or to avoid
poverty; neither should you, as men are wont to do, choose a wife who
is like yourself in property and character. you ought to consult the
interests of the state rather than your own pleasure; for by equal
marriages a society becomes unequal. and yet to enact a law that the
rich and mighty shall not marry the rich and mighty, that the quick
shall be united to the slow, and the slow to the quick, will arouse
anger in some persons and laughter in others; for they do not understand
that opposite elements ought to be mingled in the state, as wine should
be mingled with water. the object at which we aim must therefore be
left to the influence of public opinion. and do not forget our former
precept, that every one should seek to attain immortality and raise up
a fair posterity to serve god.--let this be the prelude of the law about
the duty of marriage. but if a man will not listen, and at thirty-five
years of age is still unmarried, he shall pay an annual fine: if he be
of the first class, 100 drachmas; if of the second, 70; if of the third,
60; and if of the fourth, 30. this fine shall be sacred to here; and if
he refuse to pay, a tenfold penalty shall be exacted by the treasurer of
here, who shall be responsible for the payment. further, the unmarried
man shall receive no honour or obedience from the young, and he shall
not retain the right of punishing others. a man is neither to give
nor receive a dowry beyond a certain fixed sum; in our state, for his
consolation, if he be poor, let him know that he need neither receive
nor give one, for every citizen is provided with the necessaries of
life. again, if the woman is not rich, her husband will not be her
humble servant. he who disobeys this law shall pay a fine according to
his class, which shall be exacted by the treasurers of here and zeus.

the betrothal of the parties shall be made by the next of kin, or
if there are none, by the guardians. the offerings and ceremonies of
marriage shall be determined by the interpreters of sacred rites. let
the wedding party be moderate; five male and five female friends, and a
like number of kinsmen, will be enough. the expense should not exceed,
for the first class, a mina; and for the second, half a mina; and should
be in like proportion for the other classes. extravagance is to be
regarded as vulgarity and ignorance of nuptial proprieties. much wine is
only to be drunk at the festivals of dionysus, and certainly not on the
occasion of a marriage. the bride and bridegroom, who are taking a great
step in life, ought to have all their wits about them; they should be
especially careful of the night on which god may give them increase, and
which this will be none can say. their bodies and souls should be in the
most temperate condition; they should abstain from all that partakes of
the nature of disease or vice, which will otherwise become hereditary.
there is an original divinity in man which preserves all things, if used
with proper respect. he who marries should make one of the two houses
on the lot the nest and nursery of his young; he should leave his father
and mother, and then his affection for them will be only increased by
absence. he will go forth as to a colony, and will there rear up his
offspring, handing on the torch of life to another generation.

about property in general there is little difficulty, with the exception
of property in slaves, which is an institution of a very doubtful
character. the slavery of the helots is approved by some and condemned
by others; and there is some doubt even about the slavery of the
mariandynians at heraclea and of the thessalian penestae. this makes us
ask, what shall we do about slaves? to which every one would agree in
replying,--let us have the best and most attached whom we can get. all
of us have heard stories of slaves who have been better to their masters
than sons or brethren. yet there is an opposite doctrine, that slaves
are never to be trusted; as homer says, 'slavery takes away half a man's
understanding.' and different persons treat them in different ways:
there are some who never trust them, and beat them like dogs, until
they make them many times more slavish than they were before; and others
pursue the opposite plan. man is a troublesome animal, as has been often
shown, megillus, notably in the revolts of the messenians; and great
mischiefs have arisen in countries where there are large bodies of
slaves of one nationality. two rules may be given for their management:
first that they should not, if possible, be of the same country or have
a common language; and secondly, that they should be treated by their
master with more justice even than equals, out of regard to himself
quite as much as to them. for he who is righteous in the treatment of
his slaves, or of any inferiors, will sow in them the seed of virtue.
masters should never jest with their slaves: this, which is a common but
foolish practice, increases the difficulty and painfulness of managing
them.

next as to habitations. these ought to have been spoken of before; for
no man can marry a wife, and have slaves, who has not a house for them
to live in. let us supply the omission. the temples should be placed
round the agora, and the city built in a circle on the heights. near the
temples, which are holy places and the habitations of the gods, should
be buildings for the magistrates, and the courts of law, including those
in which capital offences are to be tried. as to walls, megillus, i
agree with sparta that they should sleep in the earth; 'cold steel
is the best wall,' as the poet finely says. besides, how absurd to be
sending out our youth to fortify and guard the borders of our country,
and then to build a city wall, which is very unhealthy, and is apt to
make people fancy that they may run there and rest in idleness, not
knowing that true repose comes from labour, and that idleness is only
a renewal of trouble. if, however, there must be a wall, the private
houses had better be so arranged as to form one wall; this will have an
agreeable aspect, and the building will be safer and more defensible.
these objects should be attended to at the foundation of the city. the
wardens of the city must see that they are carried out; and they
must also enforce cleanliness, and preserve the public buildings from
encroachments. moreover, they must take care to let the rain flow
off easily, and must regulate other matters concerning the general
administration of the city. if any further enactments prove to be
necessary, the guardians of the law must supply them.

and now, having provided buildings, and having married our citizens,
we will proceed to speak of their mode of life. in a well-constituted
state, individuals cannot be allowed to live as they please. why do
i say this? because i am going to enact that the bridegroom shall not
absent himself from the common meals. they were instituted originally
on the occasion of some war, and, though deemed singular when first
founded, they have tended greatly to the security of states. there was a
difficulty in introducing them, but there is no difficulty in them now.
there is, however, another institution about which i would speak, if i
dared. i may preface my proposal by remarking that disorder in a state
is the source of all evil, and order of all good. now in sparta and
crete there are common meals for men, and this, as i was saying, is a
divine and natural institution. but the women are left to themselves;
they live in dark places, and, being weaker, and therefore wickeder,
than men, they are at the bottom of a good deal more than half the evil
of states. this must be corrected, and the institution of common
meals extended to both sexes. but, in the present unfortunate state
of opinion, who would dare to establish them? and still more, who can
compel women to eat and drink in public? they will defy the legislator
to drag them out of their holes. and in any other state such a proposal
would be drowned in clamour, but in our own i think that i can show the
attempt to be just and reasonable. 'there is nothing which we should
like to hear better.' listen, then; having plenty of time, we will
go back to the beginning of things, which is an old subject with us.
'right.' either the race of mankind never had a beginning and will never
have an end, or the time which has elapsed since man first came into
being is all but infinite. 'no doubt.' and in this infinity of time
there have been changes of every kind, both in the order of the seasons
and in the government of states and in the customs of eating and
drinking. vines and olives were at length discovered, and the blessings
of demeter and persephone, of which one triptolemus is said to have been
the minister; before his time the animals had been eating one another.
and there are nations in which mankind still sacrifice their fellow-men,
and other nations in which they lead a kind of orphic existence, and
will not sacrifice animals, or so much as taste of a cow--they offer
fruits or cakes moistened with honey. perhaps you will ask me what is
the bearing of these remarks? 'we would gladly hear.' i will endeavour
to explain their drift. i see that the virtue of human life depends on
the due regulation of three wants or desires. the first is the desire
of meat, the second of drink; these begin with birth, and make us
disobedient to any voice other than that of pleasure. the third and
fiercest and greatest need is felt latest; this is love, which is a
madness setting men's whole nature on fire. these three disorders of
mankind we must endeavour to restrain by three mighty influences--fear,
and law, and reason, which, with the aid of the muses and the gods of
contests, may extinguish our lusts.

but to return. after marriage let us proceed to the generation of
children, and then to their nurture and education--thus gradually
approaching the subject of syssitia. there are, however, some other
points which are suggested by the three words--meat, drink, love.
'proceed,' the bride and bridegroom ought to set their mind on having a
brave offspring. now a man only succeeds when he takes pains; wherefore
the bridegroom ought to take special care of the bride, and the bride
of the bridegroom, at the time when their children are about to be born.
and let there be a committee of matrons who shall meet every day at
the temple of eilithyia at a time fixed by the magistrates, and inform
against any man or woman who does not observe the laws of married life.
the time of begetting children and the supervision of the parents shall
last for ten years only; if at the expiration of this period they have
no children, they may part, with the consent of their relatives and the
official matrons, and with a due regard to the interests of either; if
a dispute arise, ten of the guardians of the law shall be chosen as
arbiters. the matrons shall also have power to enter the houses of the
young people, if necessary, and to advise and threaten them. if their
efforts fail, let them go to the guardians of the law; and if they
too fail, the offender, whether man or woman, shall be forbidden to
be present at all family ceremonies. if when the time for begetting
children has ceased, either husband or wife have connexion with others
who are of an age to beget children, they shall be liable to the same
penalties as those who are still having a family. but when both parties
have ceased to beget children there shall be no penalties. if men
and women live soberly, the enactments of law may be left to slumber;
punishment is necessary only when there is great disorder of manners.

the first year of children's lives is to be registered in their
ancestral temples; the name of the archon of the year is to be inscribed
on a whited wall in every phratry, and the names of the living members
of the phratry close to them, to be erased at their decease. the proper
time of marriage for a woman shall be from sixteen years to twenty; for
a man, from thirty to thirty-five (compare republic). the age of holding
office for a woman is to be forty, for a man thirty years. the time for
military service for a man is to be from twenty years to sixty; for a
woman, from the time that she has ceased to bear children until fifty.

book vii. now that we have married our citizens and brought their
children into the world, we have to find nurture and education for them.
this is a matter of precept rather than of law, and cannot be precisely
regulated by the legislator. for minute regulations are apt to be
transgressed, and frequent transgressions impair the habit of obedience
to the laws. i speak darkly, but i will also try to exhibit my wares in
the light of day. am i not right in saying that a good education tends
to the improvement of body and mind? 'certainly.' and the body is
fairest which grows up straight and well-formed from the time of birth.
'very true.' and we observe that the first shoot of every living thing
is the greatest; many even contend that man is not at twenty-five twice
the height that he was at five. 'true.' and growth without exercise of
the limbs is the source of endless evils in the body. 'yes.' the body
should have the most exercise when growing most. 'what, the bodies of
young infants?' nay, the bodies of unborn infants. i should like to
explain to you this singular kind of gymnastics. the athenians are fond
of cock-fighting, and the people who keep cocks carry them about in
their hands or under their arms, and take long walks, to improve, not
their own health, but the health of the birds. here is a proof of the
usefulness of motion, whether of rocking, swinging, riding, or tossing
upon the wave; for all these kinds of motion greatly increase strength
and the powers of digestion. hence we infer that our women, when they
are with child, should walk about and fashion the embryo; and the
children, when born, should be carried by strong nurses,--there must be
more than one of them,--and should not be suffered to walk until they
are three years old. shall we impose penalties for the neglect of these
rules? the greatest penalty, that is, ridicule, and the difficulty of
making the nurses do as we bid them, will be incurred by ourselves.
'then why speak of such matters?' in the hope that heads of families may
learn that the due regulation of them is the foundation of law and order
in the state.

and now, leaving the body, let us proceed to the soul; but we must first
repeat that perpetual motion by night and by day is good for the young
creature. this is proved by the corybantian cure of motion, and by the
practice of nurses who rock children in their arms, lapping them at
the same time in sweet strains. and the reason of this is obvious. the
affections, both of the bacchantes and of the children, arise from fear,
and this fear is occasioned by something wrong which is going on
within them. now a violent external commotion tends to calm the violent
internal one; it quiets the palpitation of the heart, giving to the
children sleep, and bringing back the bacchantes to their right minds
by the help of dances and acceptable sacrifices. but if fear has such
power, will not a child who is always in a state of terror grow up timid
and cowardly, whereas if he learns from the first to resist fear he will
develop a habit of courage? 'very true.' and we may say that the use
of motion will inspire the souls of children with cheerfulness and
therefore with courage. 'of course.' softness enervates and
irritates the temper of the young, and violence renders them mean and
misanthropical. 'but how is the state to educate them when they are as
yet unable to understand the meaning of words?' why, surely they roar
and cry, like the young of any other animal, and the nurse knows the
meaning of these intimations of the child's likes or dislikes, and the
occasions which call them forth. about three years is passed by children
in a state of imperfect articulation, which is quite long enough time
to make them either good- or ill-tempered. and, therefore, during these
first three years, the infant should be as free as possible from fear
and pain. 'yes, and he should have as much pleasure as possible.' there,
i think, you are wrong; for the influence of pleasure in the beginning
of education is fatal. a man should neither pursue pleasure nor wholly
avoid pain. he should embrace the mean, and cultivate that state of calm
which mankind, taught by some inspiration, attribute to god; and he who
would be like god should neither be too fond of pleasure himself, nor
should he permit any other to be thus given; above all, not the infant,
whose character is just in the making. it may sound ridiculous, but i
affirm that a woman in her pregnancy should be carefully tended, and
kept from excessive pleasures and pains.

'i quite agree with you about the duty of avoiding extremes and
following the mean.'

let us consider a further point. the matters which are now in question
are generally called customs rather than laws; and we have already made
the reflection that, though they are not, properly speaking, laws, yet
neither can they be neglected. for they fill up the interstices of
law, and are the props and ligatures on which the strength of the whole
building depends. laws without customs never last; and we must not
wonder if habit and custom sometimes lengthen out our laws. 'very true.'
up to their third year, then, the life of children may be regulated by
customs such as we have described. from three to six their minds have
to be amused; but they must not be allowed to become self-willed and
spoilt. if punishment is necessary, the same rule will hold as in the
case of slaves; they must neither be punished in hot blood nor ruined
by indulgence. the children of that age will have their own modes of
amusing themselves; they should be brought for their play to the village
temples, and placed under the care of nurses, who will be responsible
to twelve matrons annually chosen by the women who have authority over
marriage. these shall be appointed, one out of each tribe, and their
duty shall be to keep order at the meetings: slaves who break the rules
laid down by them, they shall punish by the help of some of the public
slaves; but citizens who dispute their authority shall be brought before
the magistrates. after six years of age there shall be a separation of
the sexes; the boys will go to learn riding and the use of arms, and the
girls may, if they please, also learn. here i note a practical error in
early training. mothers and nurses foolishly believe that the left hand
is by nature different from the right, whereas the left leg and foot are
acknowledged to be the same as the right. but the truth is that nature
made all things to balance, and the power of using the left hand, which
is of little importance in the case of the plectrum of the lyre, may
make a great difference in the art of the warrior, who should be a
skilled gymnast and able to fight and balance himself in any position.
if a man were a briareus, he should use all his hundred hands at once;
at any rate, let everybody employ the two which they have. to these
matters the magistrates, male and female, should attend; the women
superintending the nursing and amusement of the children, and the men
superintending their education, that all of them, boys and girls alike,
may be sound, wind and limb, and not spoil the gifts of nature by bad
habits.

education has two branches--gymnastic, which is concerned with the body;
and music, which improves the soul. and gymnastic has two parts, dancing
and wrestling. of dancing one kind imitates musical recitation and aims
at stateliness and freedom; another kind is concerned with the training
of the body, and produces health, agility, and beauty. there is no
military use in the complex systems of wrestling which pass under the
names of antaeus and cercyon, or in the tricks of boxing, which are
attributed to amycus and epeius; but good wrestling and the habit of
extricating the neck, hands, and sides, should be diligently learnt and
taught. in our dances imitations of war should be practised, as in the
dances of the curetes in crete and of the dioscuri at sparta, or as
in the dances in complete armour which were taught us athenians by the
goddess athene. youths who are not yet of an age to go to war should
make religious processions armed and on horseback; and they should also
engage in military games and contests. these exercises will be equally
useful in peace and war, and will benefit both states and families.

next follows music, to which we will once more return; and here i shall
venture to repeat my old paradox, that amusements have great influence
on laws. he who has been taught to play at the same games and with the
same playthings will be content with the same laws. there is no greater
evil in a state than the spirit of innovation. in the case of the
seasons and winds, in the management of our bodies and in the habits of
our minds, change is a dangerous thing. and in everything but what is
bad the same rule holds. we all venerate and acquiesce in the laws to
which we are accustomed; and if they have continued during long
periods of time, and there is no remembrance of their ever having been
otherwise, people are absolutely afraid to change them. now how can we
create this quality of immobility in the laws? i say, by not allowing
innovations in the games and plays of children. the children who are
always having new plays, when grown up will be always having new laws.
changes in mere fashions are not serious evils, but changes in our
estimate of men's characters are most serious; and rhythms and music are
representations of characters, and therefore we must avoid novelties in
dance and song. for securing permanence no better method can be imagined
than that of the egyptians. 'what is their method?' they make a calendar
for the year, arranging on what days the festivals of the various
gods shall be celebrated, and for each festival they consecrate an
appropriate hymn and dance. in our state a similar arrangement shall
in the first instance be framed by certain individuals, and afterwards
solemnly ratified by all the citizens. he who introduces other hymns
or dances shall be excluded by the priests and priestesses and the
guardians of the law; and if he refuses to submit, he may be prosecuted
for impiety. but we must not be too ready to speak about such great
matters. even a young man, when he hears something unaccustomed, stands
and looks this way and that, like a traveller at a place where three
ways meet; and at our age a man ought to be very sure of his ground
in so singular an argument. 'very true.' then, leaving the subject for
further examination at some future time, let us proceed with our laws
about education, for in this manner we may probably throw light upon our
present difficulty. 'let us do as you say.' the ancients used the term
nomoi to signify harmonious strains, and perhaps they fancied that
there was a connexion between the songs and laws of a country. and we
say--whosoever shall transgress the strains by law established is a
transgressor of the laws, and shall be punished by the guardians of
the law and by the priests and priestesses. 'very good.' how can we
legislate about these consecrated strains without incurring ridicule?
moulds or types must be first framed, and one of the types shall
be--abstinence from evil words at sacrifices. when a son or brother
blasphemes at a sacrifice there is a sound of ill-omen heard in the
family; and many a chorus stands by the altar uttering inauspicious
words, and he is crowned victor who excites the hearers most with
lamentations. such lamentations should be reserved for evil days, and
should be uttered only by hired mourners; and let the singers not wear
circlets or ornaments of gold. to avoid every evil word, then, shall be
our first type. 'agreed.' our second law or type shall be, that prayers
ever accompany sacrifices; and our third, that, inasmuch as all prayers
are requests, they shall be only for good; this the poets must be made
to understand. 'certainly.' have we not already decided that no gold or
silver plutus shall be allowed in our city? and did not this show that
we were dissatisfied with the poets? and may we not fear that, if they
are allowed to utter injudicious prayers, they will bring the greatest
misfortunes on the state? and we must therefore make a law that the poet
is not to contradict the laws or ideas of the state; nor is he to show
his poems to any private persons until they have first received the
imprimatur of the director of education. a fourth musical law will be
to the effect that hymns and praises shall be offered to gods, and to
heroes and demigods. still another law will permit eulogies of eminent
citizens, whether men or women, but only after their death. as to songs
and dances, we will enact as follows:--there shall be a selection made
of the best ancient musical compositions and dances; these shall be
chosen by judges, who ought not to be less than fifty years of age. they
will accept some, and reject or amend others, for which purpose they
will call, if necessary, the poets themselves into council. the severe
and orderly music is the style in which to educate children, who,
if they are accustomed to this, will deem the opposite kind to be
illiberal, but if they are accustomed to the other, will count this to
be cold and unpleasing. 'true.' further, a distinction should be made
between the melodies of men and women. nature herself teaches that
the grand or manly style should be assigned to men, and to women the
moderate and temperate. so much for the subjects of education. but to
whom are they to be taught, and when? i must try, like the shipwright,
who lays down the keel of a vessel, to build a secure foundation for the
vessel of the soul in her voyage through life. human affairs are hardly
serious, and yet a sad necessity compels us to be serious about them.
let us, therefore, do our best to bring the matter to a conclusion.
'very good.' i say then, that god is the object of a man's most serious
endeavours. but man is created to be the plaything of the gods; and
therefore the aim of every one should be to pass through life, not in
grim earnest, but playing at the noblest of pastimes, in another spirit
from that which now prevails. for the common opinion is, that work is
for the sake of play, war of peace; whereas in war there is neither
amusement nor instruction worth speaking of. the life of peace is that
which men should chiefly desire to lengthen out and improve. they should
live sacrificing, singing, and dancing, with the view of propitiating
gods and heroes. i have already told you the types of song and dance
which they should follow: and 'some things,' as the poet well says, 'you
will devise for yourself--others, god will suggest to you.'

these words of his may be applied to our pupils. they will partly teach
themselves, and partly will be taught by god, the art of propitiating
him; for they are his puppets, and have only a small portion in truth.
'you have a poor opinion of man.' no wonder, when i compare him with
god; but, if you are offended, i will place him a little higher.

next follow the building for gymnasia and schools; these will be in
the midst of the city, and outside will be riding-schools and
archery-grounds. in all of them there ought to be instructors of the
young, drawn from foreign parts by pay, and they will teach them music
and war. education shall be compulsory; the children must attend school,
whether their parents like it or not; for they belong to the state more
than to their parents. and i say further, without hesitation, that the
same education in riding and gymnastic shall be given both to men and
women. the ancient tradition about the amazons confirms my view, and
at the present day there are myriads of women, called sauromatides,
dwelling near the pontus, who practise the art of riding as well as
archery and the use of arms. but if i am right, nothing can be more
foolish than our modern fashion of training men and women differently,
whereby the power the city is reduced to a half. for reflect--if women
are not to have the education of men, some other must be found for them,
and what other can we propose? shall they, like the women of thrace,
tend cattle and till the ground; or, like our own, spin and weave, and
take care of the house? or shall they follow the spartan custom, which
is between the two?--there the maidens share in gymnastic exercises and
in music; and the grown women, no longer engaged in spinning, weave the
web of life, although they are not skilled in archery, like the amazons,
nor can they imitate our warrior goddess and carry shield or spear, even
in the extremity of their country's need. compared with our women,
the sauromatides are like men. but your legislators, megillus, as i
maintain, only half did their work; they took care of the men, and left
the women to take care of themselves.

'shall we suffer the stranger, cleinias, to run down sparta in this
way?'

'why, yes; for we cannot withdraw the liberty which we have already
conceded to him.'

what will be the manner of life of men in moderate circumstances, freed
from the toils of agriculture and business, and having common tables
for themselves and their families which are under the inspection of
magistrates, male and female? are men who have these institutions only
to eat and fatten like beasts? if they do, how can they escape the fate
of a fatted beast, which is to be torn in pieces by some other beast
more valiant than himself? true, theirs is not the perfect way of life,
for they have not all things in common; but the second best way of life
also confers great blessings. even those who live in the second state
have a work to do twice as great as the work of any pythian or olympic
victor; for their labour is for the body only, but ours both for body
and soul. and this higher work ought to be pursued night and day to the
exclusion of every other. the magistrates who keep the city should be
wakeful, and the master of the household should be up early and before
all his servants; and the mistress, too, should awaken her handmaidens,
and not be awakened by them. much sleep is not required either for our
souls or bodies. when a man is asleep, he is no better than if he were
dead; and he who loves life and wisdom will take no more sleep than
is necessary for health. magistrates who are wide awake at night are
terrible to the bad; but they are honoured by the good, and are useful
to themselves and the state.

when the morning dawns, let the boy go to school. as the sheep need the
shepherd, so the boy needs a master; for he is at once the most cunning
and the most insubordinate of creatures. let him be taken away from
mothers and nurses, and tamed with bit and bridle, being treated as a
freeman in that he learns and is taught, but as a slave in that he
may be chastised by all other freemen; and the freeman who neglects to
chastise him shall be disgraced. all these matters will be under the
supervision of the director of education.

him we will address as follows: we have spoken to you, o illustrious
teacher of youth, of the song, the time, and the dance, and of martial
strains; but of the learning of letters and of prose writings, and of
music, and of the use of calculation for military and domestic purposes
we have not spoken, nor yet of the higher use of numbers in reckoning
divine things--such as the revolutions of the stars, or the arrangements
of days, months, and years, of which the true calculation is necessary
in order that seasons and festivals may proceed in regular course, and
arouse and enliven the city, rendering to the gods their due, and making
men know them better. there are, we say, many things about which we have
not as yet instructed you--and first, as to reading and music: shall
the pupil be a perfect scholar and musician, or not even enter on these
studies? he should certainly enter on both:--to letters he will apply
himself from the age of ten to thirteen, and at thirteen he will begin
to handle the lyre, and continue to learn music until he is sixteen;
no shorter and no longer time will be allowed, however fond he or his
parents may be of the pursuit. the study of letters he should carry
to the extent of simple reading and writing, but he need not care for
calligraphy and tachygraphy, if his natural gifts do not enable him to
acquire them in the three years. and here arises a question as to the
learning of compositions when unaccompanied with music, i mean, prose
compositions. they are a dangerous species of literature. speak then, o
guardians of the law, and tell us what we shall do about them. 'you seem
to be in a difficulty.' yes; it is difficult to go against the opinion
of all the world. 'but have we not often already done so?' very true.
and you imply that the road which we are taking, though disagreeable
to many, is approved by those whose judgment is most worth having.
'certainly.' then i would first observe that we have many poets, comic
as well as tragic, with whose compositions, as people say, youth are
to be imbued and saturated. some would have them learn by heart entire
poets; others prefer extracts. now i believe, and the general opinion
is, that some of the things which they learn are good, and some bad.
'then how shall we reject some and select others?' a happy thought
occurs to me; this long discourse of ours is a sample of what we want,
and is moreover an inspired work and a kind of poem. i am naturally
pleased in reflecting upon all our words, which appear to me to be just
the thing for a young man to hear and learn. i would venture, then, to
offer to the director of education this treatise of laws as a pattern
for his guidance; and in case he should find any similar compositions,
written or oral, i would have him carefully preserve them, and commit
them in the first place to the teachers who are willing to learn them
(he should turn off the teacher who refuses), and let them communicate
the lesson to the young.

i have said enough to the teacher of letters; and now we will proceed to
the teacher of the lyre. he must be reminded of the advice which we gave
to the sexagenarian minstrels; like them he should be quick to perceive
the rhythms suited to the expression of virtue, and to reject the
opposite. with a view to the attainment of this object, the pupil and
his instructor are to use the lyre because its notes are pure; the voice
and string should coincide note for note: nor should there be complex
harmonies and contrasts of intervals, or variations of times or rhythms.
three years' study is not long enough to give a knowledge of these
intricacies; and our pupils will have many things of more importance to
learn. the tunes and hymns which are to be consecrated for each festival
have been already determined by us.

having given these instructions to the director of music, let us now
proceed to dancing and gymnastic, which must also be taught to boys and
girls by masters and mistresses. our minister of education will have a
great deal to do; and being an old man, how will he get through so much
work? there is no difficulty;--the law will provide him with assistants,
male and female; and he will consider how important his office is,
and how great the responsibility of choosing them. for if education
prospers, the vessel of state sails merrily along; or if education
fails, the consequences are not even to be mentioned. of dancing and
gymnastics something has been said already. we include under the latter
military exercises, the various uses of arms, all that relates to
horsemanship, and military evolutions and tactics. there should be
public teachers of both arts, paid by the state, and women as well as
men should be trained in them. the maidens should learn the armed dance,
and the grown-up women be practised in drill and the use of arms, if
only in case of extremity, when the men are gone out to battle, and they
are left to guard their families. birds and beasts defend their young,
but women instead of fighting run to the altars, thus degrading man
below the level of the animals. 'such a lack of education, stranger, is
both unseemly and dangerous.'

wrestling is to be pursued as a military exercise, but the meaning of
this, and the nature of the art, can only be explained when action
is combined with words. next follows dancing, which is of two kinds;
imitative, first, of the serious and beautiful; and, secondly, of the
ludicrous and grotesque. the first kind may be further divided into the
dance of war and the dance of peace. the former is called the pyrrhic;
in this the movements of attack and defence are imitated in a direct and
manly style, which indicates strength and sufficiency of body and mind.
the latter of the two, the dance of peace, is suitable to orderly and
law-abiding men. these must be distinguished from the bacchic dances
which imitate drunken revelry, and also from the dances by which
purifications are effected and mysteries celebrated. such dances cannot
be characterized either as warlike or peaceful, and are unsuited to a
civilized state. now the dances of peace are of two classes:--the first
of them is the more violent, being an expression of joy and triumph
after toil and danger; the other is more tranquil, symbolizing the
continuance and preservation of good. in speaking or singing we
naturally move our bodies, and as we have more or less courage or
self-control we become less or more violent and excited. thus from the
imitation of words in gestures the art of dancing arises. now one man
imitates in an orderly, another in a disorderly manner: and so the
peaceful kinds of dance have been appropriately called emmeleiai, or
dances of order, as the warlike have been called pyrrhic. in the latter
a man imitates all sorts of blows and the hurling of weapons and the
avoiding of them; in the former he learns to bear himself gracefully
and like a gentleman. the types of these dances are to be fixed by the
legislator, and when the guardians of the law have assigned them to the
several festivals, and consecrated them in due order, no further change
shall be allowed.

thus much of the dances which are appropriate to fair forms and noble
souls. comedy, which is the opposite of them, remains to be considered.
for the serious implies the ludicrous, and opposites cannot be
understood without opposites. but a man of repute will desire to
avoid doing what is ludicrous. he should leave such performances to
slaves,--they are not fit for freemen; and there should be some element
of novelty in them. concerning tragedy, let our law be as follows: when
the inspired poet comes to us with a request to be admitted into our
state, we will reply in courteous words--we also are tragedians and your
rivals; and the drama which we enact is the best and noblest, being the
imitation of the truest and noblest life, with a view to which our state
is ordered. and we cannot allow you to pitch your stage in the agora,
and make your voices to be heard above ours, or suffer you to address
our women and children and the common people on opposite principles
to our own. come then, ye children of the lydian muse, and present
yourselves first to the magistrates, and if they decide that your hymns
are as good or better than ours, you shall have your chorus; but if not,
not.

there remain three kinds of knowledge which should be learnt by
freemen--arithmetic, geometry of surfaces and of solids, and thirdly,
astronomy. few need make an accurate study of such sciences; and of
special students we will speak at another time. but most persons must be
content with the study of them which is absolutely necessary, and may
be said to be a necessity of that nature against which god himself is
unable to contend. 'what are these divine necessities of knowledge?'
necessities of a knowledge without which neither gods, nor demigods,
can govern mankind. and far is he from being a divine man who cannot
distinguish one, two, odd and even; who cannot number day and night, and
is ignorant of the revolutions of the sun and stars; for to every higher
knowledge a knowledge of number is necessary--a fool may see this; how
much, is a matter requiring more careful consideration. 'very true.'
but the legislator cannot enter into such details, and therefore we
must defer the more careful consideration of these matters to another
occasion. 'you seem to fear our habitual want of training in these
subjects.' still more do i fear the danger of bad training, which is
often worse than none at all. 'very true.' i think that a gentleman
and a freeman may be expected to know as much as an egyptian child.
in egypt, arithmetic is taught to children in their sports by a
distribution of apples or garlands among a greater or less number of
people; or a calculation is made of the various combinations which are
possible among a set of boxers or wrestlers; or they distribute cups
among the children, sometimes of gold, brass, and silver intermingled,
sometimes of one metal only. the knowledge of arithmetic which is thus
acquired is a great help, either to the general or to the manager of
a household; wherever measure is employed, men are more wide-awake in
their dealings, and they get rid of their ridiculous ignorance. 'what do
you mean?' i have observed this ignorance among my countrymen--they are
like pigs--and i am heartily ashamed both on my own behalf and on that
of all the hellenes. 'in what respect?' let me ask you a question. you
know that there are such things as length, breadth, and depth?
'yes.' and the hellenes imagine that they are commensurable (1) with
themselves, and (2) with each other; whereas they are only commensurable
with themselves. but if this is true, then we are in an unfortunate
case, and may well say to our compatriots that not to possess necessary
knowledge is a disgrace, though to possess such knowledge is nothing
very grand. 'certainly.' the discussion of arithmetical problems is a
much better amusement for old men than their favourite game of draughts.
'true.' mathematics, then, will be one of the subjects in which youth
should be trained. they may be regarded as an amusement, as well as a
useful and innocent branch of knowledge;--i think that we may include
them provisionally. 'yes; that will be the way.' the next question is,
whether astronomy shall be made a part of education. about the stars
there is a strange notion prevalent. men often suppose that it is
impious to enquire into the nature of god and the world, whereas the
very reverse is the truth. 'how do you mean?' what i am going to say may
seem absurd and at variance with the usual language of age, and yet if
true and advantageous to the state, and pleasing to god, ought not to be
withheld. 'let us hear.' my dear friend, how falsely do we and all the
hellenes speak about the sun and moon! 'in what respect?' we are always
saying that they and certain of the other stars do not keep the same
path, and we term them planets. 'yes; and i have seen the morning and
evening stars go all manner of ways, and the sun and moon doing what we
know that they always do. but i wish that you would explain your meaning
further.' you will easily understand what i have had no difficulty
in understanding myself, though we are both of us past the time of
learning. 'true; but what is this marvellous knowledge which youth are
to acquire, and of which we are ignorant?' men say that the sun, moon,
and stars are planets or wanderers; but this is the reverse of the fact.
each of them moves in one orbit only, which is circular, and not in
many; nor is the swiftest of them the slowest, as appears to human eyes.
what an insult should we offer to olympian runners if we were to put
the first last and the last first! and if that is a ridiculous error in
speaking of men, how much more in speaking of the gods? they cannot be
pleased at our telling falsehoods about them. 'they cannot.' then people
should at least learn so much about them as will enable them to avoid
impiety.

enough of education. hunting and similar pursuits now claim our
attention. these require for their regulation that mixture of law and
admonition of which we have often spoken; e.g., in what we were saying
about the nurture of young children. and therefore the whole duty of the
citizen will not consist in mere obedience to the laws; he must regard
not only the enactments but also the precepts of the legislator. i
will illustrate my meaning by an example. of hunting there are many
kinds--hunting of fish and fowl, man and beast, enemies and friends; and
the legislator can neither omit to speak about these things, nor make
penal ordinances about them all. 'what is he to do then?' he will praise
and blame hunting, having in view the discipline and exercise of youth.
and the young man will listen obediently and will regard his praises and
censures; neither pleasure nor pain should hinder him. the legislator
will express himself in the form of a pious wish for the welfare of the
young:--o my friends, he will say, may you never be induced to hunt for
fish in the waters, either by day or night; or for men, whether by sea
or land. never let the wish to steal enter into your minds; neither
be ye fowlers, which is not an occupation for gentlemen. as to land
animals, the legislator will discourage hunting by night, and also
the use of nets and snares by day; for these are indolent and unmanly
methods. the only mode of hunting which he can praise is with horses
and dogs, running, shooting, striking at close quarters. enough of the
prelude: the law shall be as follows:--

let no one hinder the holy order of huntsmen; but let the nightly
hunters who lay snares and nets be everywhere prohibited. let the fowler
confine himself to waste places and to the mountains. the fisherman is
also permitted to exercise his calling, except in harbours and sacred
streams, marshes and lakes; in all other places he may fish, provided he
does not make use of poisonous mixtures.

book viii. next, with the help of the delphian oracle, we will appoint
festivals and sacrifices. there shall be 365 of them, one for every day
in the year; and one magistrate, at least, shall offer sacrifice
daily according to rites prescribed by a convocation of priests and
interpreters, who shall co-operate with the guardians of the law, and
supply what the legislator has omitted. moreover there shall be twelve
festivals to the twelve gods after whom the twelve tribes are named:
these shall be celebrated every month with appropriate musical and
gymnastic contests. there shall also be festivals for women, to be
distinguished from the men's festivals. nor shall the gods below be
forgotten, but they must be separated from the gods above--pluto shall
have his own in the twelfth month. he is not the enemy, but the friend
of man, who releases the soul from the body, which is at least as good a
work as to unite them. further, those who have to regulate these matters
should consider that our state has leisure and abundance, and wishing to
be happy, like an individual, should lead a good life; for he who leads
such a life neither does nor suffers injury, of which the first is very
easy, and the second very difficult of attainment, and is only to be
acquired by perfect virtue. a good city has peace, but the evil city is
full of wars within and without. to guard against the danger of external
enemies the citizens should practise war at least one day in every
month; they should go out en masse, including their wives and children,
or in divisions, as the magistrates determine, and have mimic contests,
imitating in a lively manner real battles; they should also have prizes
and encomiums of valour, both for the victors in these contests, and for
the victors in the battle of life. the poet who celebrates the victors
should be fifty years old at least, and himself a man who has done great
deeds. of such an one the poems may be sung, even though he is not the
best of poets. to the director of education and the guardians of the law
shall be committed the judgment, and no song, however sweet, which has
not been licensed by them shall be recited. these regulations about
poetry, and about military expeditions, apply equally to men and to
women.

the legislator may be conceived to make the following address to
himself:--with what object am i training my citizens? are they not
strivers for mastery in the greatest of combats? certainly, will be
the reply. and if they were boxers or wrestlers, would they think of
entering the lists without many days' practice? would they not as far as
possible imitate all the circumstances of the contest; and if they
had no one to box with, would they not practise on a lifeless image,
heedless of the laughter of the spectators? and shall our soldiers go
out to fight for life and kindred and property unprepared, because sham
fights are thought to be ridiculous? will not the legislator require
that his citizens shall practise war daily, performing lesser exercises
without arms, while the combatants on a greater scale will carry arms,
and take up positions, and lie in ambuscade? and let their combats be
not without danger, that opportunity may be given for distinction,
and the brave man and the coward may receive their meed of honour
or disgrace. if occasionally a man is killed, there is no great harm
done--there are others as good as he is who will replace him; and the
state can better afford to lose a few of her citizens than to lose the
only means of testing them.

'we agree, stranger, that such warlike exercises are necessary.' but why
are they so rarely practised? or rather, do we not all know the reasons?
one of them (1) is the inordinate love of wealth. this absorbs the soul
of a man, and leaves him no time for any other pursuit. knowledge is
valued by him only as it tends to the attainment of wealth. all is lost
in the desire of heaping up gold and silver; anybody is ready to do
anything, right or wrong, for the sake of eating and drinking, and
the indulgence of his animal passions. 'most true.' this is one of the
causes which prevents a man being a good soldier, or anything else
which is good; it converts the temperate and orderly into shopkeepers or
servants, and the brave into burglars or pirates. many of these latter
are men of ability, and are greatly to be pitied, because their souls
are hungering and thirsting all their lives long. the bad forms of
government (2) are another reason--democracy, oligarchy, tyranny, which,
as i was saying, are not states, but states of discord, in which the
rulers are afraid of their subjects, and therefore do not like them to
become rich, or noble, or valiant. now our state will escape both
these causes of evil; the society is perfectly free, and has plenty of
leisure, and is not allowed by the laws to be absorbed in the pursuit
of wealth; hence we have an excellent field for a perfect education, and
for the introduction of martial pastimes. let us proceed to describe the
character of these pastimes. all gymnastic exercises in our state
must have a military character; no other will be allowed. activity and
quickness are most useful in war; and yet these qualities do not attain
their greatest efficiency unless the competitors are armed. the runner
should enter the lists in armour, and in the races which our heralds
proclaim, no prize is to be given except to armed warriors. let there be
six courses--first, the stadium; secondly, the diaulos or double course;
thirdly, the horse course; fourthly, the long course; fifthly, races (1)
between heavy-armed soldiers who shall pass over sixty stadia and
finish at a temple of ares, and (2) between still more heavily-armed
competitors who run over smoother ground; sixthly, a race for archers,
who shall run over hill and dale a distance of a hundred stadia, and
their goal shall be a temple of apollo and artemis. there shall be three
contests of each kind--one for boys, another for youths, a third for
men; the course for the boys we will fix at half, and that for the
youths at two-thirds of the entire length. women shall join in the
races: young girls who are not grown up shall run naked; but after
thirteen they shall be suitably dressed; from thirteen to eighteen they
shall be obliged to share in these contests, and from eighteen to twenty
they may if they please and if they are unmarried. as to trials of
strength, single combats in armour, or battles between two and two, or
of any number up to ten, shall take the place of wrestling and the heavy
exercises. and there must be umpires, as there are now in wrestling,
to determine what is a fair hit and who is conqueror. instead of the
pancratium, let there be contests in which the combatants carry bows
and wear light shields and hurl javelins and throw stones. the next
provision of the law will relate to horses, which, as we are in crete,
need be rarely used by us, and chariots never; our horse-racing prizes
will only be given to single horses, whether colts, half-grown, or
full-grown. their riders are to wear armour, and there shall be a
competition between mounted archers. women, if they have a mind, may
join in the exercises of men.

but enough of gymnastics, and nearly enough of music. all musical
contests will take place at festivals, whether every third or every
fifth year, which are to be fixed by the guardians of the law, the
judges of the games, and the director of education, who for this
purpose shall become legislators and arrange times and conditions. the
principles on which such contests are to be ordered have been often
repeated by the first legislator; no more need be said of them, nor
are the details of them important. but there is another subject of the
highest importance, which, if possible, should be determined by the
laws, not of man, but of god; or, if a direct revelation is impossible,
there is need of some bold man who, alone against the world, will
speak plainly of the corruption of human nature, and go to war with the
passions of mankind. 'we do not understand you.' i will try to make my
meaning plainer. in speaking of education, i seemed to see young men and
maidens in friendly intercourse with one another; and there arose in my
mind a natural fear about a state, in which the young of either sex are
well nurtured, and have little to do, and occupy themselves chiefly with
festivals and dances. how can they be saved from those passions which
reason forbids them to indulge, and which are the ruin of so many?
the prohibition of wealth, and the influence of education, and the
all-seeing eye of the ruler, will alike help to promote temperance; but
they will not wholly extirpate the unnatural loves which have been the
destruction of states; and against this evil what remedy can be devised?
lacedaemon and crete give no assistance here; on the subject of love, as
i may whisper in your ear, they are against us. suppose a person were to
urge that you ought to restore the natural use which existed before the
days of laius; he would be quite right, but he would not be supported by
public opinion in either of your states. or try the matter by the test
which we apply to all laws,--who will say that the permission of such
things tends to virtue? will he who is seduced learn the habit of
courage; or will the seducer acquire temperance? and will any legislator
be found to make such actions legal?

but to judge of this matter truly, we must understand the nature of love
and friendship, which may take very different forms. for we speak of
friendship, first, when there is some similarity or equality of virtue;
secondly, when there is some want; and either of these, when in excess,
is termed love. the first kind is gentle and sociable; the second is
fierce and unmanageable; and there is also a third kind, which is akin
to both, and is under the dominion of opposite principles. the one is of
the body, and has no regard for the character of the beloved; but he who
is under the influence of the other disregards the body, and is a looker
rather than a lover, and desires only with his soul to be knit to the
soul of his friend; while the intermediate sort is both of the body
and of the soul. here are three kinds of love: ought the legislator to
prohibit all of them equally, or to allow the virtuous love to remain?
'the latter, clearly.' i expected to gain your approval; but i will
reserve the task of convincing our friend cleinias for another occasion.
'very good.' to make right laws on this subject is in one point of view
easy, and in another most difficult; for we know that in some cases most
men abstain willingly from intercourse with the fair. the unwritten
law which prohibits members of the same family from such intercourse is
strictly obeyed, and no thought of anything else ever enters into the
minds of men in general. a little word puts out the fire of their lusts.
'what is it?' the declaration that such things are hateful to the gods,
and most abominable and unholy. the reason is that everywhere, in jest
and earnest alike, this is the doctrine which is repeated to all
from their earliest youth. they see on the stage that an oedipus or a
thyestes or a macareus, when undeceived, are ready to kill themselves.
there is an undoubted power in public opinion when no breath is heard
adverse to the law; and the legislator who would enslave these enslaving
passions must consecrate such a public opinion all through the city.
'good: but how can you create it?' a fair objection; but i promised to
try and find some means of restraining loves to their natural objects. a
law which would extirpate unnatural love as effectually as incest is
at present extirpated, would be the source of innumerable blessings,
because it would be in accordance with nature, and would get rid of
excess in eating and drinking and of adulteries and frenzies, making men
love their wives, and having other excellent effects. i can imagine that
some lusty youth overhears what we are saying, and roars out in abusive
terms that we are legislating for impossibilities. and so a person
might have said of the syssitia, or common meals; but this is refuted by
facts, although even now they are not extended to women. 'true.' there
is no impossibility or super-humanity in my proposed law, as i shall
endeavour to prove. 'do so.' will not a man find abstinence more easy
when his body is sound than when he is in ill-condition? 'yes.' have we
not heard of iccus of tarentum and other wrestlers who abstained wholly
for a time? yet they were infinitely worse educated than our citizens,
and far more lusty in their bodies. and shall they have abstained for
the sake of an athletic contest, and our citizens be incapable of a
similar endurance for the sake of a much nobler victory,--the victory
over pleasure, which is true happiness? will not the fear of impiety
enable them to conquer that which many who were inferior to them have
conquered? 'i dare say.' and therefore the law must plainly declare
that our citizens should not fall below the other animals, who live all
together in flocks, and yet remain pure and chaste until the time of
procreation comes, when they pair, and are ever after faithful to their
compact. but if the corruption of public opinion is too great to allow
our first law to be carried out, then our guardians of the law must turn
legislators, and try their hand at a second law. they must minimize the
appetites, diverting the vigour of youth into other channels, allowing
the practice of love in secret, but making detection shameful. three
higher principles may be brought to bear on all these corrupt natures.
'what are they?' religion, honour, and the love of the higher qualities
of the soul. perhaps this is a dream only, yet it is the best of dreams;
and if not the whole, still, by the grace of god, a part of what we
desire may be realized. either men may learn to abstain wholly from any
loves, natural or unnatural, except of their wedded wives; or, at
least, they may give up unnatural loves; or, if detected, they shall
be punished with loss of citizenship, as aliens from the state in their
morals. 'i entirely agree with you,' said megillus, 'but cleinias must
speak for himself.' 'i will give my opinion by-and-by.'

we were speaking of the syssitia, which will be a natural institution
in a cretan colony. whether they shall be established after the model
of crete or lacedaemon, or shall be different from either, is an
unimportant question which may be determined without difficulty. we
may, therefore, proceed to speak of the mode of life among our citizens,
which will be far less complex than in other cities; a state which is
inland and not maritime requires only half the number of laws. there is
no trouble about trade and commerce, and a thousand other things. the
legislator has only to regulate the affairs of husbandmen and shepherds,
which will be easily arranged, now that the principal questions, such as
marriage, education, and government, have been settled.

let us begin with husbandry: first, let there be a law of zeus against
removing a neighbour's landmark, whether he be a citizen or stranger.
for this is 'to move the immoveable'; and zeus, the god of kindred,
witnesses to the wrongs of citizens, and zeus, the god of strangers,
to the wrongs of strangers. the offence of removing a boundary shall
receive two punishments--the first will be inflicted by the god himself;
the second by the judges. in the next place, the differences between
neighbours about encroachments must be guarded against. he who
encroaches shall pay twofold the amount of the injury; of all such
matters the wardens of the country shall be the judges, in lesser cases
the officers, and in greater the whole number of them belonging to
any one division. any injury done by cattle, the decoying of bees, the
careless firing of woods, the planting unduly near a neighbour's
ground, shall all be visited with proper damages. such details have been
determined by previous legislators, and need not now be mixed up with
greater matters. husbandmen have had of old excellent rules about
streams and waters; and we need not 'divert their course.' anybody
may take water from a common stream, if he does not thereby cut off a
private spring; he may lead the water in any direction, except through
a house or temple, but he must do no harm beyond the channel. if land
is without water the occupier shall dig down to the clay, and if at this
depth he find no water, he shall have a right of getting water from his
neighbours for his household; and if their supply is limited, he
shall receive from them a measure of water fixed by the wardens of the
country. if there be heavy rains, the dweller on the higher ground must
not recklessly suffer the water to flow down upon a neighbour beneath
him, nor must he who lives upon lower ground or dwells in an adjoining
house refuse an outlet. if the two parties cannot agree, they shall go
before the wardens of the city or country, and if a man refuse to abide
by their decision, he shall pay double the damage which he has caused.

in autumn god gives us two boons--one the joy of dionysus not to be laid
up--the other to be laid up. about the fruits of autumn let the law be
as follows: he who gathers the storing fruits of autumn, whether
grapes or figs, before the time of the vintage, which is the rising of
arcturus, shall pay fifty drachmas as a fine to dionysus, if he gathers
on his own ground; if on his neighbour's ground, a mina, and two-thirds
of a mina if on that of any one else. the grapes or figs not used for
storing a man may gather when he pleases on his own ground, but on that
of others he must pay the penalty of removing what he has not laid down.
if he be a slave who has gathered, he shall receive a stroke for every
grape or fig. a metic must purchase the choice fruit; but a stranger may
pluck for himself and his attendant. this right of hospitality, however,
does not extend to storing grapes. a slave who eats of the storing
grapes or figs shall be beaten, and the freeman be dismissed with a
warning. pears, apples, pomegranates, may be taken secretly, but he who
is detected in the act of taking them shall be lightly beaten off, if
he be not more than thirty years of age. the stranger and the elder may
partake of them, but not carry any away; the latter, if he does not obey
the law, shall fail in the competition of virtue, if anybody brings up
his offence against him.

water is also in need of protection, being the greatest element of
nutrition, and, unlike the other elements--soil, air, and sun--which
conspire in the growth of plants, easily polluted. and therefore he
who spoils another's water, whether in springs or reservoirs, either by
trenching, or theft, or by means of poisonous substances, shall pay the
damage and purify the stream. at the getting-in of the harvest everybody
shall have a right of way over his neighbour's ground, provided he is
careful to do no damage beyond the trespass, or if he himself will gain
three times as much as his neighbour loses. of all this the magistrates
are to take cognizance, and they are to assess the damage where the
injury does not exceed three minae; cases of greater damage can be
tried only in the public courts. a charge against a magistrate is to
be referred to the public courts, and any one who is found guilty of
deciding corruptly shall pay twofold to the aggrieved person. matters
of detail relating to punishments and modes of procedure, and summonses,
and witnesses to summonses, do not require the mature wisdom of the aged
legislator; the younger generation may determine them according to their
experience; but when once determined, they shall remain unaltered.

the following are to be the regulations respecting handicrafts:--no
citizen, or servant of a citizen, is to practise them. for the citizen
has already an art and mystery, which is the care of the state; and no
man can practise two arts, or practise one and superintend another. no
smith should be a carpenter, and no carpenter, having many slaves who
are smiths, should look after them himself; but let each man practise
one art which shall be his means of livelihood. the wardens of the city
should see to this, punishing the citizen who offends with temporary
deprival of his rights--the foreigner shall be imprisoned, fined,
exiled. any disputes about contracts shall be determined by the wardens
of the city up to fifty drachmae--above that sum by the public courts.
no customs are to be exacted either on imports or exports. nothing
unnecessary is to be imported from abroad, whether for the service of
the gods or for the use of man--neither purple, nor other dyes, nor
frankincense,--and nothing needed in the country is to be exported.
these things are to be decided on by the twelve guardians of the law who
are next in seniority to the five elders. arms and the materials of war
are to be imported and exported only with the consent of the generals,
and then only by the state. there is to be no retail trade either in
these or any other articles. for the distribution of the produce of the
country, the cretan laws afford a rule which may be usefully followed.
all shall be required to distribute corn, grain, animals, and other
valuable produce, into twelve portions. each of these shall be
subdivided into three parts--one for freemen, another for servants,
and the third shall be sold for the supply of artisans, strangers, and
metics. these portions must be equal whether the produce be much or
little; and the master of a household may distribute the two portions
among his family and his slaves as he pleases--the remainder is to be
measured out to the animals.

next as to the houses in the country--there shall be twelve villages,
one in the centre of each of the twelve portions; and in every village
there shall be temples and an agora--also shrines for heroes or for
any old magnesian deities who linger about the place. in every division
there shall be temples of hestia, zeus, and athene, as well as of the
local deity, surrounded by buildings on eminences, which will be the
guard-houses of the rural police. the dwellings of the artisans will be
thus arranged:--the artisans shall be formed into thirteen guilds, one
of which will be divided into twelve parts and settled in the city; of
the rest there shall be one in each division of the country. and the
magistrates will fix them on the spots where they will cause the least
inconvenience and be most serviceable in supplying the wants of the
husbandmen.

the care of the agora will fall to the wardens of the agora. their
first duty will be the regulation of the temples which surround the
market-place; and their second to see that the markets are orderly and
that fair dealing is observed. they will also take care that the sales
which the citizens are required to make to strangers are duly executed.
the law shall be, that on the first day of each month the auctioneers to
whom the sale is entrusted shall offer grain; and at this sale a twelfth
part of the whole shall be exposed, and the foreigner shall supply his
wants for a month. on the tenth, there shall be a sale of liquids, and
on the twenty-third of animals, skins, woven or woollen stuffs, and
other things which husbandmen have to sell and foreigners want to buy.
none of these commodities, any more than barley or flour, or any other
food, may be retailed by a citizen to a citizen; but foreigners may
sell them to one another in the foreigners' market. there must also be
butchers who will sell parts of animals to foreigners and craftsmen,
and their servants; and foreigners may buy firewood wholesale of the
commissioners of woods, and may sell retail to foreigners. all other
goods must be sold in the market, at some place indicated by the
magistrates, and shall be paid for on the spot. he who gives credit, and
is cheated, will have no redress. in buying or selling, any excess or
diminution of what the law allows shall be registered. the same rule
is to be observed about the property of metics. anybody who practises a
handicraft may come and remain twenty years from the day on which he is
enrolled; at the expiration of this time he shall take what he has and
depart. the only condition which is to be imposed upon him as the tax
of his sojourn is good conduct; and he is not to pay any tax for being
allowed to buy or sell. but if he wants to extend the time of his
sojourn, and has done any service to the state, and he can persuade the
council and assembly to grant his request, he may remain. the children
of metics may also be metics; and the period of twenty years, during
which they are permitted to sojourn, is to count, in their case, from
their fifteenth year.

no mention occurs in the laws of the doctrine of ideas. the will of god,
the authority of the legislator, and the dignity of the soul, have
taken their place in the mind of plato. if we ask what is that truth or
principle which, towards the end of his life, seems to have absorbed
him most, like the idea of good in the republic, or of beauty in the
symposium, or of the unity of virtue in the protagoras, we should
answer--the priority of the soul to the body: his later system mainly
hangs upon this. in the laws, as in the sophist and statesman, we pass
out of the region of metaphysical or transcendental ideas into that of
psychology.

the opening of the fifth book, though abrupt and unconnected in style,
is one of the most elevated passages in plato. the religious feeling
which he seeks to diffuse over the commonest actions of life, the
blessedness of living in the truth, the great mistake of a man living
for himself, the pity as well as anger which should be felt at evil,
the kindness due to the suppliant and the stranger, have the temper of
christian philosophy. the remark that elder men, if they want to educate
others, should begin by educating themselves; the necessity of creating
a spirit of obedience in the citizens; the desirableness of limiting
property; the importance of parochial districts, each to be placed under
the protection of some god or demigod, have almost the tone of a modern
writer. in many of his views of politics, plato seems to us, like some
politicians of our own time, to be half socialist, half conservative.

in the laws, we remark a change in the place assigned by him to pleasure
and pain. there are two ways in which even the ideal systems of morals
may regard them: either like the stoics, and other ascetics, we may say
that pleasure must be eradicated; or if this seems unreal to us, we may
affirm that virtue is the true pleasure; and then, as aristotle says,
'to be brought up to take pleasure in what we ought, exercises a great
and paramount influence on human life' (arist. eth. nic.). or as plato
says in the laws, 'a man will recognize the noblest life as having the
greatest pleasure and the least pain, if he have a true taste.' if we
admit that pleasures differ in kind, the opposition between these two
modes of speaking is rather verbal than real; and in the greater part of
the writings of plato they alternate with each other. in the republic,
the mere suggestion that pleasure may be the chief good, is received
by socrates with a cry of abhorrence; but in the philebus, innocent
pleasures vindicate their right to a place in the scale of goods. in the
protagoras, speaking in the person of socrates rather than in his own,
plato admits the calculation of pleasure to be the true basis of ethics,
while in the phaedo he indignantly denies that the exchange of one
pleasure for another is the exchange of virtue. so wide of the mark
are they who would attribute to plato entire consistency in thoughts or
words.

he acknowledges that the second state is inferior to the first--in this,
at any rate, he is consistent; and he still casts longing eyes upon the
ideal. several features of the first are retained in the second: the
education of men and women is to be as far as possible the same; they
are to have common meals, though separate, the men by themselves, the
women with their children; and they are both to serve in the army; the
citizens, if not actually communists, are in spirit communistic;
they are to be lovers of equality; only a certain amount of wealth is
permitted to them, and their burdens and also their privileges are to
be proportioned to this. the constitution in the laws is a timocracy
of wealth, modified by an aristocracy of merit. yet the political
philosopher will observe that the first of these two principles is
fixed and permanent, while the latter is uncertain and dependent on the
opinion of the multitude. wealth, after all, plays a great part in
the second republic of plato. like other politicians, he deems that a
property qualification will contribute stability to the state. the four
classes are derived from the constitution of athens, just as the form
of the city, which is clustered around a citadel set on a hill, is
suggested by the acropolis at athens. plato, writing under pythagorean
influences, seems really to have supposed that the well-being of the
city depended almost as much on the number 5040 as on justice and
moderation. but he is not prevented by pythagoreanism from observing the
effects which climate and soil exercise on the characters of nations.

he was doubtful in the republic whether the ideal or communistic state
could be realized, but was at the same time prepared to maintain that
whether it existed or not made no difference to the philosopher, who
will in any case regulate his life by it (republic). he has now lost
faith in the practicability of his scheme--he is speaking to 'men, and
not to gods or sons of gods' (laws). yet he still maintains it to be the
true pattern of the state, which we must approach as nearly as possible:
as aristotle says, 'after having created a more general form of state,
he gradually brings it round to the other' (pol.). he does not observe,
either here or in the republic, that in such a commonwealth there would
be little room for the development of individual character. in several
respects the second state is an improvement on the first, especially in
being based more distinctly on the dignity of the soul. the standard
of truth, justice, temperance, is as high as in the republic;--in one
respect higher, for temperance is now regarded, not as a virtue, but as
the condition of all virtue. it is finally acknowledged that the virtues
are all one and connected, and that if they are separated, courage is
the lowest of them. the treatment of moral questions is less speculative
but more human. the idea of good has disappeared; the excellences of
individuals--of him who is faithful in a civil broil, of the examiner
who is incorruptible, are the patterns to which the lives of the
citizens are to conform. plato is never weary of speaking of the honour
of the soul, which can only be honoured truly by being improved. to make
the soul as good as possible, and to prepare her for communion with the
gods in another world by communion with divine virtue in this, is the
end of life. if the republic is far superior to the laws in form and
style, and perhaps in reach of thought, the laws leave on the mind
of the modern reader much more strongly the impression of a struggle
against evil, and an enthusiasm for human improvement. when plato says
that he must carry out that part of his ideal which is practicable,
he does not appear to have reflected that part of an ideal cannot be
detached from the whole.

the great defect of both his constitutions is the fixedness which he
seeks to impress upon them. he had seen the athenian empire, almost
within the limits of his own life, wax and wane, but he never seems
to have asked himself what would happen if, a century from the time at
which he was writing, the greek character should have as much changed as
in the century which had preceded. he fails to perceive that the greater
part of the political life of a nation is not that which is given them
by their legislators, but that which they give themselves. he has never
reflected that without progress there cannot be order, and that mere
order can only be preserved by an unnatural and despotic repression. the
possibility of a great nation or of an universal empire arising never
occurred to him. he sees the enfeebled and distracted state of the
hellenic world in his own later life, and thinks that the remedy is to
make the laws unchangeable. the same want of insight is apparent in his
judgments about art. he would like to have the forms of sculpture and of
music fixed as in egypt. he does not consider that this would be fatal
to the true principles of art, which, as socrates had himself taught,
was to give life (xen. mem.). we wonder how, familiar as he was with
the statues of pheidias, he could have endured the lifeless and
half-monstrous works of egyptian sculpture. the 'chants of isis' (laws),
we might think, would have been barbarous in an athenian ear. but
although he is aware that there are some things which are not so well
among 'the children of the nile,' he is deeply struck with the stability
of egyptian institutions. both in politics and in art plato seems to
have seen no way of bringing order out of disorder, except by taking a
step backwards. antiquity, compared with the world in which he lived,
had a sacredness and authority for him: the men of a former age were
supposed by him to have had a sense of reverence which was wanting among
his contemporaries. he could imagine the early stages of civilization;
he never thought of what the future might bring forth. his experience
is confined to two or three centuries, to a few greek states, and to an
uncertain report of egypt and the east. there are many ways in which
the limitations of their knowledge affected the genius of the greeks.
in criticism they were like children, having an acute vision of things
which were near to them, blind to possibilities which were in the
distance.

the colony is to receive from the mother-country her original
constitution, and some of the first guardians of the law. the guardians
of the law are to be ministers of justice, and the president of
education is to take precedence of them all. they are to keep the
registers of property, to make regulations for trade, and they are to
be superannuated at seventy years of age. several questions of modern
politics, such as the limitation of property, the enforcement of
education, the relations of classes, are anticipated by plato. he hopes
that in his state will be found neither poverty nor riches; every
man having the necessaries of life, he need not go fortune-hunting in
marriage. almost in the spirit of the gospel he would say, 'how hardly
can a rich man dwell in a perfect state.' for he cannot be a good man
who is always gaining too much and spending too little (laws; compare
arist. eth. nic.). plato, though he admits wealth as a political
element, would deny that material prosperity can be the foundation of
a really great community. a man's soul, as he often says, is more to be
esteemed than his body; and his body than external goods. he repeats the
complaint which has been made in all ages, that the love of money is the
corruption of states. he has a sympathy with thieves and burglars, 'many
of whom are men of ability and greatly to be pitied, because their souls
are hungering and thirsting all their lives long;' but he has
little sympathy with shopkeepers or retailers, although he makes the
reflection, which sometimes occurs to ourselves, that such occupations,
if they were carried on honestly by the best men and women, would be
delightful and honourable. for traders and artisans a moderate gain was,
in his opinion, best. he has never, like modern writers, idealized
the wealth of nations, any more than he has worked out the problems of
political economy, which among the ancients had not yet grown into a
science. the isolation of greek states, their constant wars, the want of
a free industrial population, and of the modern methods and instruments
of 'credit,' prevented any great extension of commerce among them; and
so hindered them from forming a theory of the laws which regulate the
accumulation and distribution of wealth.

the constitution of the army is aristocratic and also democratic;
official appointment is combined with popular election. the two
principles are carried out as follows: the guardians of the law nominate
generals out of whom three are chosen by those who are or have been
of the age for military service; and the generals elected have the
nomination of certain of the inferior officers. but if either in the
case of generals or of the inferior officers any one is ready to swear
that he knows of a better man than those nominated, he may put the
claims of his candidate to the vote of the whole army, or of the
division of the service which he will, if elected, command. there is
a general assembly, but its functions, except at elections, are hardly
noticed. in the election of the boule, plato again attempts to mix
aristocracy and democracy. this is effected, first as in the servian
constitution, by balancing wealth and numbers; for it cannot be supposed
that those who possessed a higher qualification were equal in number
with those who had a lower, and yet they have an equal number of
representatives. in the second place, all classes are compelled to vote
in the election of senators from the first and second class; but the
fourth class is not compelled to elect from the third, nor the third
and fourth from the fourth. thirdly, out of the 180 persons who are thus
chosen from each of the four classes, 720 in all, 360 are to be taken by
lot; these form the council for the year.

these political adjustments of plato's will be criticised by the
practical statesman as being for the most part fanciful and ineffectual.
he will observe, first of all, that the only real check on democracy
is the division into classes. the second of the three proposals, though
ingenious, and receiving some light from the apathy to politics which
is often shown by the higher classes in a democracy, would have little
power in times of excitement and peril, when the precaution was most
needed. at such political crises, all the lower classes would vote
equally with the higher. the subtraction of half the persons chosen
at the first election by the chances of the lot would not raise the
character of the senators, and is open to the objection of uncertainty,
which necessarily attends this and similar schemes of double
representative government. nor can the voters be expected to retain the
continuous political interest required for carrying out such a proposal
as plato's. who could select 180 persons of each class, fitted to be
senators? and whoever were chosen by the voter in the first instance,
his wishes might be neutralized by the action of the lot. yet the scheme
of plato is not really so extravagant as the actual constitution of
athens, in which all the senators appear to have been elected by
lot (apo kuamou bouleutai), at least, after the revolution made by
cleisthenes; for the constitution of the senate which was established
by solon probably had some aristocratic features, though their precise
nature is unknown to us. the ancients knew that election by lot was
the most democratic of all modes of appointment, seeming to say in the
objectionable sense, that 'one man is as good as another.' plato, who is
desirous of mingling different elements, makes a partial use of the lot,
which he applies to candidates already elected by vote. he attempts also
to devise a system of checks and balances such as he supposes to have
been intended by the ancient legislators. we are disposed to say to
him, as he himself says in a remarkable passage, that 'no man ever
legislates, but accidents of all sorts, which legislate for us in all
sorts of ways. the violence of war and the hard necessity of poverty are
constantly overturning governments and changing laws.' and yet, as he
adds, the true legislator is still required: he must co-operate with
circumstances. many things which are ascribed to human foresight are
the result of chance. ancient, and in a less degree modern political
constitutions, are never consistent with themselves, because they are
never framed on a single design, but are added to from time to time as
new elements arise and gain the preponderance in the state. we often
attribute to the wisdom of our ancestors great political effects which
have sprung unforeseen from the accident of the situation. power, not
wisdom, is most commonly the source of political revolutions. and
the result, as in the roman republic, of the co-existence of opposite
elements in the same state is, not a balance of power or an equable
progress of liberal principles, but a conflict of forces, of which one
or other may happen to be in the ascendant. in greek history, as well as
in plato's conception of it, this 'progression by antagonism' involves
reaction: the aristocracy expands into democracy and returns again to
tyranny.

the constitution of the laws may be said to consist, besides the
magistrates, mainly of three elements,--an administrative council,
the judiciary, and the nocturnal council, which is an intellectual
aristocracy, composed of priests and the ten eldest guardians of the law
and some younger co-opted members. to this latter chiefly are assigned
the functions of legislation, but to be exercised with a sparing hand.
the powers of the ordinary council are administrative rather than
legislative. the whole number of 360, as in the athenian constitution,
is distributed among the months of the year according to the number of
the tribes. not more than one-twelfth is to be in office at once,
so that the government would be made up of twelve administrations
succeeding one another in the course of the year. they are to exercise
a general superintendence, and, like the athenian counsellors, are to
preside in monthly divisions over all assemblies. of the ecclesia
over which they presided little is said, and that little relates to
comparatively trifling duties. nothing is less present to the mind of
plato than a house of commons, carrying on year by year the work of
legislation. for he supposes the laws to be already provided. as little
would he approve of a body like the roman senate. the people and the
aristocracy alike are to be represented, not by assemblies, but by
officers elected for one or two years, except the guardians of the law,
who are elected for twenty years.

the evils of this system are obvious. if in any state, as plato says
in the statesman, it is easier to find fifty good draught-players than
fifty good rulers, the greater part of the 360 who compose the council
must be unfitted to rule. the unfitness would be increased by the short
period during which they held office. there would be no traditions
of government among them, as in a greek or italian oligarchy, and no
individual would be responsible for any of their acts. everything seems
to have been sacrificed to a false notion of equality, according to
which all have a turn of ruling and being ruled. in the constitution
of the magnesian state plato has not emancipated himself from the
limitations of ancient politics. his government may be described as
a democracy of magistrates elected by the people. he never troubles
himself about the political consistency of his scheme. he does indeed
say that the greater part of the good of this world arises, not from
equality, but from proportion, which he calls the judgment of zeus
(compare aristotle's distributive justice), but he hardly makes any
attempt to carry out the principle in practice. there is no attempt
to proportion representation to merit; nor is there any body in his
commonwealth which represents the life either of a class or of the whole
state. the manner of appointing magistrates is taken chiefly from the
old democratic constitution of athens, of which it retains some of the
worst features, such as the use of the lot, while by doing away with
the political character of the popular assembly the mainspring of the
machine is taken out. the guardians of the law, thirty-seven in number,
of whom the ten eldest reappear as a part of the nocturnal council at
the end of the twelfth book, are to be elected by the whole military
class, but they are to hold office for twenty years, and would therefore
have an oligarchical rather than a democratic character. nothing is said
of the manner in which the functions of the nocturnal council are to
be harmonized with those of the guardians of the law, or as to how the
ordinary council is related to it.

similar principles are applied to inferior offices. to some the
appointment is made by vote, to others by lot. in the elections to the
priesthood, plato endeavours to mix or balance in a friendly manner
'demus and not demus.' the commonwealth of the laws, like the republic,
cannot dispense with a spiritual head, which is the same in both--the
oracle of delphi. from this the laws about all divine things are to be
derived. the final selection of the interpreters, the choice of an heir
for a vacant lot, the punishment for removing a deposit, are also to be
determined by it. plato is not disposed to encourage amateur attempts
to revive religion in states. for, as he says in the laws, 'to institute
religious rites is the work of a great intelligence.'

though the council is framed on the model of the athenian boule, the law
courts of plato do not equally conform to the pattern of the athenian
dicasteries. plato thinks that the judges should speak and ask
questions:--this is not possible if they are numerous; he would,
therefore, have a few judges only, but good ones. he is nevertheless
aware that both in public and private suits there must be a
popular element. he insists that the whole people must share in the
administration of justice--in public causes they are to take the first
step, and the final decision is to remain with them. in private suits
they are also to retain a share; 'for the citizen who has no part in the
administration of justice is apt to think that he has no share in the
state. for this reason there is to be a court of law in every tribe
(i.e. for about every 2,000 citizens), and the judges are to be chosen
by lot.' of the courts of law he gives what he calls a superficial
sketch. nor, indeed is it easy to reconcile his various accounts
of them. it is however clear that although some officials, like the
guardians of the law, the wardens of the agora, city, and country have
power to inflict minor penalties, the administration of justice is in
the main popular. the ingenious expedient of dividing the questions of
law and fact between a judge and jury, which would have enabled plato to
combine the popular element with the judicial, did not occur to him or
to any other ancient political philosopher. though desirous of limiting
the number of judges, and thereby confining the office to persons
specially fitted for it, he does not seem to have understood that a body
of law must be formed by decisions as well as by legal enactments.

he would have men in the first place seek justice from their friends and
neighbours, because, as he truly remarks, they know best the questions
at issue; these are called in another passage arbiters rather than
judges. but if they cannot settle the matter, it is to be referred to
the courts of the tribes, and a higher penalty is to be paid by the
party who is unsuccessful in the suit. there is a further appeal allowed
to the select judges, with a further increase of penalty. the select
judges are to be appointed by the magistrates, who are to choose one
from every magistracy. they are to be elected annually, and therefore
probably for a year only, and are liable to be called to account before
the guardians of the law. in cases of which death is the penalty, the
trial takes place before a special court, which is composed of the
guardians of the law and of the judges of appeal.

in treating of the subject in book ix, he proposes to leave for the most
part the methods of procedure to a younger generation of legislators;
the procedure in capital causes he determines himself. he insists that
the vote of the judges shall be given openly, and before they vote they
are to hear speeches from the plaintiff and defendant. they are then
to take evidence in support of what has been said, and to examine
witnesses. the eldest judge is to ask his questions first, and then
the second, and then the third. the interrogatories are to continue for
three days, and the evidence is to be written down. apparently he does
not expect the judges to be professional lawyers, any more than he
expects the members of the council to be trained statesmen.

in forming marriage connexions, plato supposes that the public interest
will prevail over private inclination. there was nothing in this very
shocking to the notions of greeks, among whom the feeling of love
towards the other sex was almost deprived of sentiment or romance.
married life is to be regulated solely with a view to the good of the
state. the newly-married couple are not allowed to absent themselves
from their respective syssitia, even during their honeymoon; they are
to give their whole mind to the procreation of children; their duties to
one another at a later period of life are not a matter about which
the state is equally solicitous. divorces are readily allowed for
incompatibility of temper. as in the republic, physical considerations
seem almost to exclude moral and social ones. to modern feelings there
is a degree of coarseness in plato's treatment of the subject. yet he
also makes some shrewd remarks on marriage, as for example, that a man
who does not marry for money will not be the humble servant of his wife.
and he shows a true conception of the nature of the family, when he
requires that the newly-married couple 'should leave their father and
mother,' and have a separate home. he also provides against extravagance
in marriage festivals, which in some states of society, for instance in
the case of the hindoos, has been a social evil of the first magnitude.

in treating of property, plato takes occasion to speak of property in
slaves. they are to be treated with perfect justice; but, for their own
sake, to be kept at a distance. the motive is not so much humanity to
the slave, of which there are hardly any traces (although plato allows
that many in the hour of peril have found a slave more attached than
members of their own family), but the self-respect which the freeman and
citizen owes to himself (compare republic). if they commit crimes, they
are doubly punished; if they inform against illegal practices of their
masters, they are to receive a protection, which would probably be
ineffectual, from the guardians of the law; in rare cases they are to be
set free. plato still breathes the spirit of the old hellenic world, in
which slavery was a necessity, because leisure must be provided for the
citizen.

the education propounded in the laws differs in several points from that
of the republic. plato seems to have reflected as deeply and earnestly
on the importance of infancy as rousseau, or jean paul (compare the
saying of the latter--'not the moment of death, but the moment of
birth, is probably the more important'). he would fix the amusements of
children in the hope of fixing their characters in after-life. in the
spirit of the statesman who said, 'let me make the ballads of a
country, and i care not who make their laws,' plato would say, 'let the
amusements of children be unchanged, and they will not want to change
the laws. the 'goddess harmonia' plays a great part in plato's ideas
of education. the natural restless force of life in children, 'who do
nothing but roar until they are three years old,' is gradually to be
reduced to law and order. as in the republic, he fixes certain forms
in which songs are to be composed: (1) they are to be strains of
cheerfulness and good omen; (2) they are to be hymns or prayers
addressed to the gods; (3) they are to sing only of the lawful and good.
the poets are again expelled or rather ironically invited to depart; and
those who remain are required to submit their poems to the censorship of
the magistrates. youth are no longer compelled to commit to memory many
thousand lyric and tragic greek verses; yet, perhaps, a worse fate is
in store for them. plato has no belief in 'liberty of prophesying'; and
having guarded against the dangers of lyric poetry, he remembers that
there is an equal danger in other writings. he cannot leave his old
enemies, the sophists, in possession of the field; and therefore he
proposes that youth shall learn by heart, instead of the compositions of
poets or prose writers, his own inspired work on laws. these, and music
and mathematics, are the chief parts of his education.

mathematics are to be cultivated, not as in the republic with a view to
the science of the idea of good,--though the higher use of them is not
altogether excluded,--but rather with a religious and political aim.
they are a sacred study which teaches men how to distribute the portions
of a state, and which is to be pursued in order that they may learn not
to blaspheme about astronomy. against three mathematical errors plato
is in profound earnest. first, the error of supposing that the three
dimensions of length, breadth, and height, are really commensurable
with one another. the difficulty which he feels is analogous to the
difficulty which he formerly felt about the connexion of ideas, and is
equally characteristic of ancient philosophy: he fixes his mind on the
point of difference, and cannot at the same time take in the similarity.
secondly, he is puzzled about the nature of fractions: in the republic,
he is disposed to deny the possibility of their existence. thirdly, his
optimism leads him to insist (unlike the spanish king who thought that
he could have improved on the mechanism of the heavens) on the perfect
or circular movement of the heavenly bodies. he appears to mean, that
instead of regarding the stars as overtaking or being overtaken by one
another, or as planets wandering in many paths, a more comprehensive
survey of the heavens would enable us to infer that they all alike moved
in a circle around a centre (compare timaeus; republic). he probably
suspected, though unacquainted with the true cause, that the appearance
of the heavens did not agree with the reality: at any rate, his notions
of what was right or fitting easily overpowered the results of actual
observation. to the early astronomers, who lived at the revival of
science, as to plato, there was nothing absurd in a priori astronomy,
and they would probably have made fewer real discoveries of they had
followed any other track. (compare introduction to the republic.)

the science of dialectic is nowhere mentioned by name in the laws, nor
is anything said of the education of after-life. the child is to begin
to learn at ten years of age: he is to be taught reading and writing for
three years, from ten to thirteen, and no longer; and for three years
more, from thirteen to sixteen, he is to be instructed in music. the
great fault which plato finds in the contemporary education is the
almost total ignorance of arithmetic and astronomy, in which the greeks
would do well to take a lesson from the egyptians (compare republic).
dancing and wrestling are to have a military character, and women as
well as men are to be taught the use of arms. the military spirit which
plato has vainly endeavoured to expel in the first two books returns
again in the seventh and eighth. he has evidently a sympathy with the
soldier, as well as with the poet, and he is no mean master of the
art, or at least of the theory, of war (compare laws; republic), though
inclining rather to the spartan than to the athenian practice of
it (laws). of a supreme or master science which was to be the
'coping-stone' of the rest, few traces appear in the laws. he seems to
have lost faith in it, or perhaps to have realized that the time for
such a science had not yet come, and that he was unable to fill up
the outline which he had sketched. there is no requirement that the
guardians of the law shall be philosophers, although they are to know
the unity of virtue, and the connexion of the sciences. nor are we
told that the leisure of the citizens, when they are grown up, is to
be devoted to any intellectual employment. in this respect we note a
falling off from the republic, but also there is 'the returning to it'
of which aristotle speaks in the politics. the public and family duties
of the citizens are to be their main business, and these would, no
doubt, take up a great deal more time than in the modern world we are
willing to allow to either of them. plato no longer entertains the idea
of any regular training to be pursued under the superintendence of the
state from eighteen to thirty, or from thirty to thirty-five; he has
taken the first step downwards on 'constitution hill' (republic). but
he maintains as earnestly as ever that 'to men living under this second
polity there remains the greatest of all works, the education of the
soul,' and that no bye-work should be allowed to interfere with it.
night and day are not long enough for the consummation of it.

few among us are either able or willing to carry education into later
life; five or six years spent at school, three or four at a university,
or in the preparation for a profession, an occasional attendance at a
lecture to which we are invited by friends when we have an hour to spare
from house-keeping or money-making--these comprise, as a matter of fact,
the education even of the educated; and then the lamp is extinguished
'more truly than heracleitus' sun, never to be lighted again'
(republic). the description which plato gives in the republic of the
state of adult education among his contemporaries may be applied almost
word for word to our own age. he does not however acquiesce in this
widely-spread want of a higher education; he would rather seek to make
every man something of a philosopher before he enters on the duties of
active life. but in the laws he no longer prescribes any regular course
of study which is to be pursued in mature years. nor does he remark that
the education of after-life is of another kind, and must consist with
the majority of the world rather in the improvement of character than in
the acquirement of knowledge. it comes from the study of ourselves
and other men: from moderation and experience: from reflection on
circumstances: from the pursuit of high aims: from a right use of the
opportunities of life. it is the preservation of what we have been,
and the addition of something more. the power of abstract study or
continuous thought is very rare, but such a training as this can be
given by every one to himself.

the singular passage in book vii., in which plato describes life as a
pastime, like many other passages in the laws is imperfectly expressed.
two thoughts seem to be struggling in his mind: first, the reflection,
to which he returns at the end of the passage, that men are playthings
or puppets, and that god only is the serious aim of human endeavours;
this suggests to him the afterthought that, although playthings, they
are the playthings of the gods, and that this is the best of them. the
cynical, ironical fancy of the moment insensibly passes into a religious
sentiment. in another passage he says that life is a game of which god,
who is the player, shifts the pieces so as to procure the victory of
good on the whole. or once more: tragedies are acted on the stage; but
the best and noblest of them is the imitation of the noblest life, which
we affirm to be the life of our whole state. again, life is a chorus, as
well as a sort of mystery, in which we have the gods for playmates. men
imagine that war is their serious pursuit, and they make war that they
may return to their amusements. but neither wars nor amusements are the
true satisfaction of men, which is to be found only in the society of
the gods, in sacrificing to them and propitiating them. like a christian
ascetic, plato seems to suppose that life should be passed wholly in
the enjoyment of divine things. and after meditating in amazement on the
sadness and unreality of the world, he adds, in a sort of parenthesis,
'be cheerful, sirs' (shakespeare, tempest.)

in one of the noblest passages of plato, he speaks of the relation of
the sexes. natural relations between members of the same family have
been established of old; a 'little word' has put a stop to incestuous
connexions. but unnatural unions of another kind continued to prevail
at crete and lacedaemon, and were even justified by the example of the
gods. they, too, might be banished, if the feeling that they were unholy
and abominable could sink into the minds of men. the legislator is
to cry aloud, and spare not, 'let not men fall below the level of the
beasts.' plato does not shrink, like some modern philosophers, from
'carrying on war against the mightiest lusts of mankind;' neither does
he expect to extirpate them, but only to confine them to their natural
use and purpose, by the enactments of law, and by the influence of
public opinion. he will not feed them by an over-luxurious diet, nor
allow the healthier instincts of the soul to be corrupted by music
and poetry. the prohibition of excessive wealth is, as he says, a very
considerable gain in the way of temperance, nor does he allow of those
enthusiastic friendships between older and younger persons which in
his earlier writings appear to be alluded to with a certain degree of
amusement and without reproof (compare introduction to the symposium).
sappho and anacreon are celebrated by him in the charmides and the
phaedrus; but they would have been expelled from the magnesian state.

yet he does not suppose that the rule of absolute purity can be enforced
on all mankind. something must be conceded to the weakness of human
nature. he therefore adopts a 'second legal standard of honourable and
dishonourable, having a second standard of right.' he would abolish
altogether 'the connexion of men with men...as to women, if any man has
to do with any but those who come into his house duly married by sacred
rites, and he offends publicly in the face of all mankind, we shall be
right in enacting that he be deprived of civic honours and privileges.'
but feeling also that it is impossible wholly to control the mightiest
passions of mankind,' plato, like other legislators, makes a compromise.
the offender must not be found out; decency, if not morality, must
be respected. in this he appears to agree with the practice of all
civilized ages and countries. much may be truly said by the moralist
on the comparative harm of open and concealed vice. nor do we deny
that some moral evils are better turned out to the light, because,
like diseases, when exposed, they are more easily cured. and secrecy
introduces mystery which enormously exaggerates their power; a mere
animal want is thus elevated into a sentimental ideal. it may very
well be that a word spoken in season about things which are commonly
concealed may have an excellent effect. but having regard to the
education of youth, to the innocence of children, to the sensibilities
of women, to the decencies of society, plato and the world in general
are not wrong in insisting that some of the worst vices, if they must
exist, should be kept out of sight; this, though only a second-best
rule, is a support to the weakness of human nature. there are some
things which may be whispered in the closet, but should not be shouted
on the housetop. it may be said of this, as of many other things, that
it is a great part of education to know to whom they are to be spoken
of, and when, and where.

book ix. punishments of offences and modes of procedure come next in
order. we have a sense of disgrace in making regulations for all the
details of crime in a virtuous and well-ordered state. but seeing
that we are legislating for men and not for gods, there is no
uncharitableness in apprehending that some one of our citizens may have
a heart, like the seed which has touched the ox's horn, so hard as to be
impenetrable to the law. let our first enactment be directed against the
robbing of temples. no well-educated citizen will be guilty of such a
crime, but one of their servants, or some stranger, may, and with a view
to him, and at the same time with a remoter eye to the general infirmity
of human nature, i will lay down the law, beginning with a prelude. to
the intending robber we will say--o sir, the complaint which troubles
you is not human; but some curse has fallen upon you, inherited from
the crimes of your ancestors, of which you must purge yourself: go and
sacrifice to the gods, associate with the good, avoid the wicked; and if
you are cured of the fatal impulse, well; but if not, acknowledge death
to be better than life, and depart.

these are the accents, soft and low, in which we address the would-be
criminal. and if he will not listen, then cry aloud as with the sound of
a trumpet: whosoever robs a temple, if he be a slave or foreigner shall
be branded in the face and hands, and scourged, and cast naked beyond
the border. and perhaps this may improve him: for the law aims either
at the reformation of the criminal, or the repression of crime. no
punishment is designed to inflict useless injury. but if the offender be
a citizen, he must be incurable, and for him death is the only fitting
penalty. his iniquity, however, shall not be visited on his children,
nor shall his property be confiscated.

as to the exaction of penalties, any person who is fined for an offence
shall not be liable to pay the fine, unless he have property in excess
of his lot. for the lots must never go uncultivated for lack of means;
the guardians of the law are to provide against this. if a fine is
inflicted upon a man which he cannot pay, and for which his friends
are unwilling to give security, he shall be imprisoned and otherwise
dishonoured. but no criminal shall go unpunished:--whether death, or
imprisonment, or stripes, or fines, or the stocks, or banishment to a
remote temple, be the penalty. capital offences shall come under the
cognizance of the guardians of the law, and a college of the best of the
last year's magistrates. the order of suits and similar details we shall
leave to the lawgivers of the future, and only determine the mode of
voting. the judges are to sit in order of seniority, and the proceedings
shall begin with the speeches of the plaintiff and the defendant; and
then the judges, beginning with the eldest, shall ask questions and
collect evidence during three days, which, at the end of each day, shall
be deposited in writing under their seals on the altar of hestia; and
when they have evidence enough, after a solemn declaration that they
will decide justly, they shall vote and end the case. the votes are to
be given openly in the presence of the citizens.

next to religion, the preservation of the constitution is the first
object of the law. the greatest enemy of the state is he who attempts to
set up a tyrant, or breeds plots and conspiracies; not far below him in
guilt is a magistrate who either knowingly, or in ignorance, fails to
bring the offender to justice. any one who is good for anything will
give information against traitors. the mode of proceeding at such trials
will be the same as at trials for sacrilege; the penalty, death. but
neither in this case nor in any other is the son to bear the iniquity of
the father, unless father, grandfather, great-grandfather, have all of
them been capitally convicted, and then the family of the criminal
are to be sent off to the country of their ancestor, retaining their
property, with the exception of the lot and its fixtures. and ten are to
be selected from the younger sons of the other citizens--one of whom is
to be chosen by the oracle of delphi to be heir of the lot.

our third law will be a general one, concerning the procedure and the
judges in cases of treason. as regards the remaining or departure of the
family of the offender, the same law shall apply equally to the traitor,
the sacrilegious, and the conspirator.

a thief, whether he steals much or little, must refund twice the amount,
if he can do so without impairing his lot; if he cannot, he must go to
prison until he either pays the plaintiff, or in case of a public theft,
the city, or they agree to forgive him. 'but should all kinds of theft
incur the same penalty?' you remind me of what i know--that legislation
is never perfect. the men for whom laws are now made may be compared
to the slave who is being doctored, according to our old image, by the
unscientific doctor. for the empirical practitioner, if he chance to
meet the educated physician talking to his patient, and entering into
the philosophy of his disease, would burst out laughing and say, as
doctors delight in doing, 'foolish fellow, instead of curing the patient
you are educating him!' 'and would he not be right?' perhaps; and
he might add, that he who discourses in our fashion preaches to the
citizens instead of legislating for them. 'true.' there is, however, one
advantage which we possess--that being amateurs only, we may either take
the most ideal, or the most necessary and utilitarian view. 'but why
offer such an alternative? as if all our legislation must be done
to-day, and nothing put off until the morrow. we may surely rough-hew
our materials first, and shape and place them afterwards.' that will be
the natural way of proceeding. there is a further point. of all writings
either in prose or verse the writings of the legislator are the most
important. for it is he who has to determine the nature of good and
evil, and how they should be studied with a view to our instruction.
and is it not as disgraceful for solon and lycurgus to lay down false
precepts about the institutions of life as for homer and tyrtaeus?
the laws of states ought to be the models of writing, and what is at
variance with them should be deemed ridiculous. and we may further
imagine them to express the affection and good sense of a father or
mother, and not to be the fiats of a tyrant. 'very true.'

let us enquire more particularly about sacrilege, theft and other
crimes, for which we have already legislated in part. and this leads
us to ask, first of all, whether we are agreed or disagreed about the
nature of the honourable and just. 'to what are you referring?' i will
endeavour to explain. all are agreed that justice is honourable, whether
in men or things, and no one who maintains that a very ugly men who is
just, is in his mind fair, would be thought extravagant. 'very true.'
but if honour is to be attributed to justice, are just sufferings
honourable, or only just actions? 'what do you mean?' our laws supply a
case in point; for we enacted that the robber of temples and the traitor
should die; and this was just, but the reverse of honourable. in this
way does the language of the many rend asunder the just and honourable.
'that is true.' but is our own language consistent? i have already said
that the evil are involuntarily evil; and the evil are the unjust. now
the voluntary cannot be the involuntary; and if you two come to me
and say, 'then shall we legislate for our city?' of course, i shall
reply.--'then will you distinguish what crimes are voluntary and what
involuntary, and shall we impose lighter penalties on the latter, and
heavier on the former? or shall we refuse to determine what is the
meaning of voluntary and involuntary, and maintain that our words have
come down from heaven, and that they should be at once embodied in a
law?' all states legislate under the idea that there are two classes of
actions, the voluntary and the involuntary, but there is great confusion
about them in the minds of men; and the law can never act unless they
are distinguished. either we must abstain from affirming that unjust
actions are involuntary, or explain the meaning of this statement.
believing, then, that acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntary
and involuntary, i must endeavour to find some other mode of classifying
them. hurts are voluntary and involuntary, but all hurts are not
injuries: on the other hand, a benefit when wrongly conferred may be an
injury. an act which gives or takes away anything is not simply just;
but the legislator who has to decide whether the case is one of hurt or
injury, must consider the animus of the agent; and when there is hurt,
he must as far as possible, provide a remedy and reparation: but if
there is injustice, he must, when compensation has been made, further
endeavour to reconcile the two parties. 'excellent.' where injustice,
like disease, is remediable, there the remedy must be applied in word
or deed, with the assistance of pleasures and pains, of bounties and
penalties, or any other influence which may inspire man with the love
of justice, or hatred of injustice; and this is the noblest work of
law. but when the legislator perceives the evil to be incurable, he will
consider that the death of the offender will be a good to himself,
and in two ways a good to society: first, as he becomes an example to
others; secondly, because the city will be quit of a rogue; and in such
a case, but in no other, the legislator will punish with death.
'there is some truth in what you say. i wish, however, that you would
distinguish more clearly the difference of injury and hurt, and the
complications of voluntary and involuntary.' you will admit that anger
is of a violent and destructive nature? 'certainly.' and further, that
pleasure is different from anger, and has an opposite power, working by
persuasion and deceit? 'yes.' ignorance is the third source of crimes;
this is of two kinds--simple ignorance and ignorance doubled by conceit
of knowledge; the latter, when accompanied with power, is a source of
terrible errors, but is excusable when only weak and childish. 'true.'
we often say that one man masters, and another is mastered by pleasure
and anger. 'just so.' but no one says that one man masters, and another
is mastered by ignorance. 'you are right.' all these motives actuate men
and sometimes drive them in different ways. 'that is so.' now, then, i
am in a position to define the nature of just and unjust. by injustice i
mean the dominion of anger and fear, pleasure and pain, envy and desire,
in the soul, whether doing harm or not: by justice i mean the rule of
the opinion of the best, whether in states or individuals, extending to
the whole of life; although actions done in error are often thought to
be involuntary injustice. no controversy need be raised about names at
present; we are only desirous of fixing in our memories the heads of
error. and the pain which is called fear and anger is our first head of
error; the second is the class of pleasures and desires; and the third,
of hopes which aim at true opinion about the best;--this latter falls
into three divisions (i.e. (1) when accompanied by simple ignorance, (2)
when accompanied by conceit of wisdom combined with power, or (3) with
weakness), so that there are in all five. and the laws relating to them
may be summed up under two heads, laws which deal with acts of open
violence and with acts of deceit; to which may be added acts both
violent and deceitful, and these last should be visited with the utmost
rigour of the law. 'very properly.'

let us now return to the enactment of laws. we have treated of
sacrilege, and of conspiracy, and of treason. any of these crimes may be
committed by a person not in his right mind, or in the second childhood
of old age. if this is proved to be the fact before the judges, the
person in question shall only have to pay for the injury, and not be
punished further, unless he have on his hands the stain of blood. in
this case he shall be exiled for a year, and if he return before the
expiration of the year, he shall be retained in the public prison two
years.

homicides may be divided into voluntary and involuntary: and first of
involuntary homicide. he who unintentionally kills another man at the
games or in military exercises duly authorized by the magistrates,
whether death follow immediately or after an interval, shall be
acquitted, subject only to the purification required by the delphian
oracle. any physician whose patient dies against his will shall in like
manner be acquitted. any one who unintentionally kills the slave of
another, believing that he is his own, with or without weapons, shall
bear the master of the slave harmless, or pay a penalty amounting to
twice the value of the slave, and to this let him add a purification
greater than in the case of homicide at the games. if a man kill his
own slave, a purification only is required of him. if he kill a freeman
unintentionally, let him also make purification; and let him remember
the ancient tradition which says that the murdered man is indignant when
he sees the murderer walk about in his own accustomed haunts, and that
he terrifies him with the remembrance of his crime. and therefore the
homicide should keep away from his native land for a year, or, if he
have slain a stranger, let him avoid the land of the stranger for a like
period. if he complies with this condition, the nearest kinsman of the
deceased shall take pity upon him and be reconciled to him; but if he
refuses to remain in exile, or visits the temples unpurified, then
let the kinsman proceed against him, and demand a double penalty. the
kinsman who neglects this duty shall himself incur the curse, and any
one who likes may proceed against him, and compel him to leave his
country for five years. if a stranger involuntarily kill a stranger, any
one may proceed against him in the same manner: and the homicide, if
he be a metic, shall be banished for a year; but if he be an entire
stranger, whether he have murdered metic, citizen, or stranger, he shall
be banished for ever; and if he return, he shall be punished with death,
and his property shall go to the next of kin of the murdered man. if
he come back by sea against his will, he shall remain on the seashore,
wetting his feet in the water while he waits for a vessel to sail; or
if he be brought back by land, the magistrates shall send him unharmed
beyond the border.

next follows murder done from anger, which is of two kinds--either
arising out of a sudden impulse, and attended with remorse; or committed
with premeditation, and unattended with remorse. the cause of both is
anger, and both are intermediate between voluntary and involuntary.
the one which is committed from sudden impulse, though not wholly
involuntary, bears the image of the involuntary, and is therefore the
more excusable of the two, and should receive a gentler punishment. the
act of him who nurses his wrath is more voluntary, and therefore more
culpable. the degree of culpability depends on the presence or absence
of intention, to which the degree of punishment should correspond. for
the first kind of murder, that which is done on a momentary impulse,
let two years' exile be the penalty; for the second, that which is
accompanied with malice prepense, three. when the time of any one's
exile has expired, the guardians shall send twelve judges to the borders
of the land, who shall have authority to decide whether he may return
or not. he who after returning repeats the offence, shall be exiled
and return no more, and, if he return, shall be put to death, like
the stranger in a similar case. he who in a fit of anger kills his own
slave, shall purify himself; and he who kills another man's slave, shall
pay to his master double the value. any one may proceed against the
offender if he appear in public places, not having been purified;
and may bring to trial both the next of kin to the dead man and the
homicide, and compel the one to exact, and the other to pay, a double
penalty. if a slave kill his master, or a freeman who is not his master,
in anger, the kinsmen of the murdered person may do with the murderer
whatever they please, but they must not spare his life. if a father or
mother kill their son or daughter in anger, let the slayer remain in
exile for three years; and on the return of the exile let the parents
separate, and no longer continue to cohabit, or have the same sacred
rites with those whom he or she has deprived of a brother or sister. the
same penalty is decreed against the husband who murders his wife, and
also against the wife who murders her husband. let them be absent three
years, and on their return never again share in the same sacred rites
with their children, or sit at the same table with them. nor is a
brother or sister who have lifted up their hands against a brother or
sister, ever to come under the same roof or share in the same rites
with those whom they have robbed of a child. if a son feels such hatred
against his father or mother as to take the life of either of them,
then, if the parent before death forgive him, he shall only suffer the
penalty due to involuntary homicide; but if he be unforgiven, there
are many laws against which he has offended; he is guilty of outrage,
impiety, sacrilege all in one, and deserves to be put to death many
times over. for if the law will not allow a man to kill the authors of
his being even in self-defence, what other penalty than death can be
inflicted upon him who in a fit of passion wilfully slays his father
or mother? if a brother kill a brother in self-defence during a civil
broil, or a citizen a citizen, or a slave a slave, or a stranger a
stranger, let them be free from blame, as he is who slays an enemy in
battle. but if a slave kill a freeman, let him be as a parricide. in all
cases, however, the forgiveness of the injured party shall acquit the
agents; and then they shall only be purified, and remain in exile for a
year.

enough of actions that are involuntary, or done in anger; let us proceed
to voluntary and premeditated actions. the great source of voluntary
crime is the desire of money, which is begotten by evil education;
and this arises out of the false praise of riches, common both among
hellenes and barbarians; they think that to be the first of goods which
is really the third. for the body is not for the sake of wealth, but
wealth for the body, as the body is for the soul. if this were better
understood, the crime of murder, of which avarice is the chief cause,
would soon cease among men. next to avarice, ambition is a source of
crime, troublesome to the ambitious man himself, as well as to the chief
men of the state. and next to ambition, base fear is a motive, which
has led many an one to commit murder in order that he may get rid of the
witnesses of his crimes. let this be said as a prelude to all enactments
about crimes of violence; and the tradition must not be forgotten, which
tells that the murderer is punished in the world below, and that when
he returns to this world he meets the fate which he has dealt out to
others. if a man is deterred by the prelude and the fear of future
punishment, he will have no need of the law; but in case he disobey, let
the law be declared against him as follows:--he who of malice prepense
kills one of his kindred, shall in the first place be outlawed; neither
temple, harbour, nor agora shall be polluted by his presence. and if a
kinsman of the deceased refuse to proceed against his slayer, he shall
take the curse of pollution upon himself, and also be liable to be
prosecuted by any one who will avenge the dead. the prosecutor, however,
must observe the customary ceremonial before he proceeds against the
offender. the details of these observances will be best determined by a
conclave of prophets and interpreters and guardians of the law, and the
judges of the cause itself shall be the same as in cases of sacrilege.
he who is convicted shall be punished with death, and not be buried
within the country of the murdered person. he who flies from the law
shall undergo perpetual banishment; if he return, he may be put to
death with impunity by any relative of the murdered man or by any other
citizen, or bound and delivered to the magistrates. he who accuses a man
of murder shall demand satisfactory bail of the accused, and if this is
not forthcoming, the magistrate shall keep him in prison against the
day of trial. if a man commit murder by the hand of another, he shall
be tried in the same way as in the cases previously supposed, but if the
offender be a citizen, his body after execution shall be buried within
the land.

if a slave kill a freeman, either with his own hand or by contrivance,
let him be led either to the grave or to a place whence he can see the
grave of the murdered man, and there receive as many stripes at the hand
of the public executioner as the person who took him pleases; and if he
survive he shall be put to death. if a slave be put out of the way to
prevent his informing of some crime, his death shall be punished like
that of a citizen. if there are any of those horrible murders of kindred
which sometimes occur even in well-regulated societies, and of which the
legislator, however unwilling, cannot avoid taking cognizance, he will
repeat the old myth of the divine vengeance against the perpetrators of
such atrocities. the myth will say that the murderer must suffer what he
has done: if he have slain his father, he must be slain by his children;
if his mother, he must become a woman and perish at the hands of his
offspring in another age of the world. such a preamble may terrify him;
but if, notwithstanding, in some evil hour he murders father or
mother or brethren or children, the mode of proceeding shall be as
follows:--him who is convicted, the officers of the judges shall lead
to a spot without the city where three ways meet, and there slay him and
expose his body naked; and each of the magistrates shall cast a stone
upon his head and justify the city, and he shall be thrown unburied
beyond the border. but what shall we say of him who takes the life
which is dearest to him, that is to say, his own; and this not from any
disgrace or calamity, but from cowardice and indolence? the manner of
his burial and the purification of his crime is a matter for god and the
interpreters to decide and for his kinsmen to execute. let him, at any
rate, be buried alone in some uncultivated and nameless spot, and
be without name or monument. if a beast kill a man, not in a public
contest, let it be prosecuted for murder, and after condemnation slain
and cast without the border. also inanimate things which have caused
death, except in the case of lightning and other visitations from
heaven, shall be carried without the border. if the body of a dead man
be found, and the murderer remain unknown, the trial shall take place
all the same, and the unknown murderer shall be warned not to set foot
in the temples or come within the borders of the land; if discovered, he
shall die, and his body shall be cast out. a man is justified in taking
the life of a burglar, of a footpad, of a violator of women or youth;
and he may take the life of another with impunity in defence of father,
mother, brother, wife, or other relations.

the nurture and education which are necessary to the existence of men
have been considered, and the punishment of acts of violence which
destroy life. there remain maiming, wounding, and the like, which admit
of a similar division into voluntary and involuntary. about this class
of actions the preamble shall be: whereas men would be like wild beasts
unless they obeyed the laws, the first duty of citizens is the care
of the public interests, which unite and preserve states, as private
interests distract them. a man may know what is for the public good, but
if he have absolute power, human nature will impel him to seek pleasure
instead of virtue, and so darkness will come over his soul and over the
state. if he had mind, he would have no need of law; for mind is the
perfection of law. but such a freeman, 'whom the truth makes free,' is
hardly to be found; and therefore law and order are necessary, which are
the second-best, and they regulate things as they exist in part
only, but cannot take in the whole. for actions have innumerable
characteristics, which must be partly determined by the law and partly
left to the judge. the judge must determine the fact; and to him also
the punishment must sometimes be left. what shall the law prescribe,
and what shall be left to the judge? a city is unfortunate in which the
tribunals are either secret and speechless, or, what is worse, noisy and
public, when the people, as if they were in a theatre, clap and hoot the
various speakers. such courts a legislator would rather not have; but
if he is compelled to have them, he will speak distinctly, and leave as
little as possible to their discretion. but where the courts are good,
and presided over by well-trained judges, the penalties to be inflicted
may be in a great measure left to them; and as there are to be good
courts among our colonists, we need not determine beforehand the
exact proportion of the penalty and the crime. returning, then, to
our legislator, let us indite a law about wounding, which shall run as
follows:--he who wounds with intent to kill, and fails in his object,
shall be tried as if he had succeeded. but since god has favoured both
him and his victim, instead of being put to death, he shall be allowed
to go into exile and take his property with him, the damage due to the
sufferer having been previously estimated by the court, which shall be
the same as would have tried the case if death had ensued. if a child
should intentionally wound a parent, or a servant his master, or brother
or sister wound brother or sister with malice prepense, the penalty
shall be death. if a husband or wife wound one another with intent to
kill, the penalty which is inflicted upon them shall be perpetual exile;
and if they have young children, the guardians shall take care of them
and administer their property as if they were orphans. if they have
no children, their kinsmen male and female shall meet, and after a
consultation with the priests and guardians of the law, shall appoint an
heir of the house; for the house and family belong to the state, being
a 5040th portion of the whole. and the state is bound to preserve
her families happy and holy; therefore, when the heir of a house has
committed a capital offence, or is in exile for life, the house is to be
purified, and then the kinsmen of the house and the guardians of the law
are to find out a family which has a good name and in which there are
many sons, and introduce one of them to be the heir and priest of the
house. he shall assume the fathers and ancestors of the family, while
the first son dies in dishonour and his name is blotted out.

some actions are intermediate between the voluntary and involuntary.
those done from anger are of this class. if a man wound another in
anger, let him pay double the damage, if the injury is curable; or
fourfold, if curable, and at the same time dishonourable; and fourfold,
if incurable; the amount is to be assessed by the judges. if the wounded
person is rendered incapable of military service, the injurer, besides
the other penalties, shall serve in his stead, or be liable to a suit
for refusing to serve. if brother wounds brother, then their parents
and kindred, of both sexes, shall meet and judge the crime. the damages
shall be assessed by the parents; and if the amount fixed by them is
disputed, an appeal shall be made to the male kindred; or in the last
resort to the guardians of the law. parents who wound their children are
to be tried by judges of at least sixty years of age, who have children
of their own; and they are to determine whether death, or some lesser
punishment, is to be inflicted upon them--no relatives are to take part
in the trial. if a slave in anger smite a freeman, he is to be delivered
up by his master to the injured person. if the master suspect collusion
between the slave and the injured person, he may bring the matter to
trial: and if he fail he shall pay three times the injury; or if he
obtain a conviction, the contriver of the conspiracy shall be liable to
an action for kidnapping. he who wounds another unintentionally shall
only pay for the actual harm done.

in all outrages and acts of violence, the elder is to be more regarded
than the younger. an injury done by a younger man to an elder is
abominable and hateful; but the younger man who is struck by an elder
is to bear with him patiently, considering that he who is twenty years
older is loco parentis, and remembering the reverence which is due to
the gods who preside over birth. let him keep his hands, too, from the
stranger; instead of taking upon himself to chastise him when he is
insolent, he shall bring him before the wardens of the city, who shall
examine into the case, and if they find him guilty, shall scourge him
with as many blows as he has given; or if he be innocent, they shall
warn and threaten his accuser. when an equal strikes an equal, whether
an old man an old man, or a young man a young man, let them use only
their fists and have no weapons. he who being above forty years of age
commences a fight, or retaliates, shall be counted mean and base.

to this preamble, let the law be added: if a man smite another who is
his elder by twenty years or more, let the bystander, in case he be
older than the combatants, part them; or if he be younger than the
person struck, or of the same age with him, let him defend him as he
would a father or brother; and let the striker be brought to trial,
and if convicted imprisoned for a year or more at the discretion of
the judges. if a stranger smite one who is his elder by twenty years or
more, he shall be imprisoned for two years, and a metic, in like case,
shall suffer three years' imprisonment. he who is standing by and gives
no assistance, shall be punished according to his class in one of four
penalties--a mina, fifty, thirty, twenty drachmas. the generals and
other superior officers of the army shall form the court which tries
this class of offences.

laws are made to instruct the good, and in the hope that there may be no
need of them; also to control the bad, whose hardness of heart will not
be hindered from crime. the uttermost penalty will fall upon those who
lay violent hands upon a parent, having no fear of the gods above, or of
the punishments which will pursue them in the world below. they are
too wise in their own conceits to believe in such things: wherefore the
tortures which await them in another life must be anticipated in this.
let the law be as follows:--

if a man, being in his right mind, dare to smite his father and mother,
or his grandfather and grandmother, let the passer-by come to the
rescue; and if he be a metic or stranger who comes to the rescue, he
shall have the first place at the games; or if he do not come to the
rescue, he shall be a perpetual exile. let the citizen in the like
case be praised or blamed, and the slave receive freedom or a hundred
stripes. the wardens of the agora, the city, or the country, as the
case may be, shall see to the execution of the law. and he who is an
inhabitant of the same place and is present shall come to the rescue, or
he shall fall under a curse.

if a man be convicted of assaulting his parents, let him be banished for
ever from the city into the country, and let him abstain from all sacred
rites; and if he do not abstain, let him be punished by the wardens of
the country; and if he return to the city, let him be put to death. if
any freeman consort with him, let him be purified before he returns to
the city. if a slave strike a freeman, whether citizen or stranger, let
the bystander be obliged to seize and deliver him into the hands of the
injured person, who may inflict upon him as many blows as he
pleases, and shall then return him to his master. the law will be as
follows:--the slave who strikes a freeman shall be bound by his master,
and not set at liberty without the consent of the person whom he has
injured. all these laws apply to women as well as to men.

book x. the greatest wrongs arise out of youthful insolence, and the
greatest of all are committed against public temples; they are in the
second degree great when private rites and sepulchres are insulted; in
the third degree, when committed against parents; in the fourth degree,
when they are done against the authority or property of the rulers; in
the fifth degree, when the rights of individuals are violated. most
of these offences have been already considered; but there remains the
question of admonition and punishment of offences against the gods. let
the admonition be in the following terms:--no man who ever intentionally
did or said anything impious, had a true belief in the existence of the
gods; but either he thought that there were no gods, or that they did
not care about men, or that they were easily appeased by sacrifices and
prayers. 'what shall we say or do to such persons?' my good sir, let us
first hear the jests which they in their superiority will make upon us.
'what will they say?' probably something of this kind:--'strangers you
are right in thinking that some of us do not believe in the existence of
the gods; while others assert that they do not care for us, and others
that they are propitiated by prayers and offerings. but we want you to
argue with us before you threaten; you should prove to us by reasonable
evidence that there are gods, and that they are too good to be bribed.
poets, priests, prophets, rhetoricians, even the best of them, speak
to us of atoning for evil, and not of avoiding it. from legislators who
profess to be gentle we ask for instruction, which may, at least, have
the persuasive power of truth, if no other.' what have you to say?
'well, there is no difficulty in proving the being of the gods. the sun,
and earth, and stars, moving in their courses, the recurring seasons,
furnish proofs of their existence; and there is the general opinion
of mankind.' i fear that the unbelievers--not that i care for their
opinion--will despise us. you are not aware that their impiety proceeds,
not from sensuality, but from ignorance taking the garb of wisdom. 'what
do you mean?' at athens there are tales current both in prose and verse
of a kind which are not tolerated in a well-regulated state like yours.
the oldest of them relate the origin of the world, and the birth and
life of the gods. these narratives have a bad influence on family
relations; but as they are old we will let them pass, and consider
another kind of tales, invented by the wisdom of a younger generation,
who, if any one argues for the existence of the gods and claims that the
stars have a divine being, insist that these are mere earth and stones,
which can have no care of human things, and that all theology is a
cooking up of words. now what course ought we to take? shall we suppose
some impious man to charge us with assuming the existence of the gods,
and make a defence? or shall we leave the preamble and go on to the
laws? 'there is no hurry, and we have often said that the shorter and
worse method should not be preferred to the longer and better. the proof
that there are gods who are good, and the friends of justice, is the
best preamble of all our laws.' come, let us talk with the impious, who
have been brought up from their infancy in the belief of religion, and
have heard their own fathers and mothers praying for them and talking
with the gods as if they were absolutely convinced of their existence;
who have seen mankind prostrate in prayer at the rising and setting of
the sun and moon and at every turn of fortune, and have dared to despise
and disbelieve all this. can we keep our temper with them, when they
compel us to argue on such a theme? we must; or like them we shall go
mad, though with more reason. let us select one of them and address him
as follows:

o my son, you are young; time and experience will make you change many
of your opinions. do not be hasty in forming a conclusion about the
divine nature; and let me mention to you a fact which i know. you and
your friends are not the first or the only persons who have had these
notions about the gods. there are always a considerable number who are
infected by them: i have known many myself, and can assure you that no
one who was an unbeliever in his youth ever persisted till he was old in
denying the existence of the gods. the two other opinions, first, that
the gods exist and have no care of men, secondly, that they care for
men, but may be propitiated by sacrifices and prayers, may indeed last
through life in a few instances, but even this is not common. i would
beg of you to be patient, and learn the truth of the legislator and
others; in the mean time abstain from impiety. 'so far, our discourse
has gone well.'

i will now speak of a strange doctrine, which is regarded by many as the
crown of philosophy. they affirm that all things come into being either
by art or nature or chance, and that the greater things are done by
nature and chance, and the lesser things by art, which receiving from
nature the greater creations, moulds and fashions all those lesser works
which are termed works of art. their meaning is that fire, water, earth,
and air all exist by nature and chance, and not by art; and that out of
these, according to certain chance affinities of opposites, the sun, the
moon, the stars, and the earth have been framed, not by any action of
mind, but by nature and chance only. thus, in their opinion, the heaven
and earth were created, as well as the animals and plants. art came
later, and is of mortal birth; by her power were invented certain
images and very partial imitations of the truth, of which kind are the
creations of musicians and painters: but they say that there are
other arts which combine with nature, and have a deeper truth, such as
medicine, husbandry, gymnastic. also the greater part of politics they
imagine to co-operate with nature, but in a less degree, having more of
art, while legislation is declared by them to be wholly a work of art.
'how do you mean?' in the first place, they say that the gods exist
neither by nature nor by art, but by the laws of states, which are
different in different countries; and that virtue is one thing by nature
and another by convention; and that justice is altogether conventional,
made by law, and having authority for the moment only. this is repeated
to young men by sages and poets, and leads to impiety, and the pretended
life according to nature and in disobedience to law; for nobody believes
the gods to be such as the law affirms. 'how true! and oh! how injurious
to states and to families!' but then, what should the lawgiver do?
should he stand up in the state and threaten mankind with the severest
penalties if they persist in their unbelief, while he makes no attempt
to win them by persuasion? 'nay, stranger, the legislator ought never to
weary of trying to persuade the world that there are gods; and he should
declare that law and art exist by nature.' yes, cleinias; but these are
difficult and tedious questions. 'and shall our patience, which was
not exhausted in the enquiry about music or drink, fail now that we are
discoursing about the gods? there may be a difficulty in framing laws,
but when written down they remain, and time and diligence will make them
clear; if they are useful there would be neither reason nor religion in
rejecting them on account of their length.' most true. and the general
spread of unbelief shows that the legislator should do something in
vindication of the laws, when they are being undermined by bad men.
'he should.' you agree with me, cleinias, that the heresy consists in
supposing earth, air, fire, and water to be the first of all things.
these the heretics call nature, conceiving them to be prior to the soul.
'i agree.' you would further agree that natural philosophy is the source
of this impiety--the study appears to be pursued in a wrong way. 'in
what way do you mean?' the error consists in transposing first and
second causes. they do not see that the soul is before the body, and
before all other things, and the author and ruler of them all. and if
the soul is prior to the body, then the things of the soul are prior to
the things of the body. in other words, opinion, attention, mind, art,
law, are prior to sensible qualities; and the first and greater works of
creation are the results of art and mind, whereas the works of nature,
as they are improperly termed, are secondary and subsequent. 'why do you
say "improperly"?' because when they speak of nature they seem to mean
the first creative power. but if the soul is first, and not fire and
air, then the soul above all things may be said to exist by nature. and
this can only be on the supposition that the soul is prior to the body.
shall we try to prove that it is so? 'by all means.' i fear that the
greenness of our argument will ludicrously contrast with the ripeness of
our ages. but as we must go into the water, and the stream is strong, i
will first attempt to cross by myself, and if i arrive at the bank, you
shall follow. remembering that you are unaccustomed to such discussions,
i will ask and answer the questions myself, while you listen in safety.
but first i must pray the gods to assist at the demonstration of their
own existence--if ever we are to call upon them, now is the time. let
me hold fast to the rope, and enter into the depths: shall i put the
question to myself in this form?--are all things at rest, and is nothing
in motion? or are some things in motion, and some things at rest? 'the
latter.' and do they move and rest, some in one place, some in more?
'yes.' there may be (1) motion in the same place, as in revolution on an
axis, which is imparted swiftly to the larger and slowly to the lesser
circle; and there may be motion in different places, having sometimes
(2) one centre of motion and sometimes (3) more. (4) when bodies in
motion come against other bodies which are at rest, they are divided
by them, and (5) when they are caught between other bodies coming from
opposite directions they unite with them; and (6) they grow by union and
(7) waste by dissolution while their constitution remains the same, but
are (8) destroyed when their constitution fails. there is a growth from
one dimension to two, and from a second to a third, which then becomes
perceptible to sense; this process is called generation, and the
opposite, destruction. we have now enumerated all possible motions
with the exception of two. 'what are they?' just the two with which our
enquiry is concerned; for our enquiry relates to the soul. there is one
kind of motion which is only able to move other things; there is another
which can move itself as well, working in composition and decomposition,
by increase and diminution, by generation and destruction. 'granted.'
(9) that which moves and is moved by another is the ninth kind of
motion; (10) that which is self-moved and moves others is the tenth. and
this tenth kind of motion is the mightiest, and is really the first, and
is followed by that which was improperly called the ninth. 'how do you
mean?' must not that which is moved by others finally depend upon that
which is moved by itself? nothing can be affected by any transition
prior to self-motion. then the first and eldest principle of motion,
whether in things at rest or not at rest, will be the principle of
self-motion; and that which is moved by others and can move others will
be the second. 'true.' let me ask another question:

what is the name which is given to self-motion when manifested in any
material substance? 'life.' and soul too is life? 'very good.' and are
there not three kinds of knowledge--a knowledge (1) of the essence, (2)
of the definition, (3) of the name? and sometimes the name leads us
to ask the definition, sometimes the definition to ask the name. for
example, number can be divided into equal parts, and when thus divided
is termed even, and the definition of even and the word 'even' refer
to the same thing. 'very true.' and what is the definition of the thing
which is named 'soul'? must we not reply, 'the self-moved'? and have we
not proved that the self-moved is the source of motion in other things?
'yes.' and the motion which is not self-moved will be inferior to this?
'true.' and if so, we shall be right in saying that the soul is prior
and superior to the body, and the body by nature subject and inferior to
the soul? 'quite right.' and we agreed that if the soul was prior to
the body, the things of the soul were prior to the things of the body?
'certainly.' and therefore desires, and manners, and thoughts, and true
opinions, and recollections, are prior to the length and breadth and
force of bodies. 'to be sure.' in the next place, we acknowledge that
the soul is the cause of good and evil, just and unjust, if we suppose
her to be the cause of all things? 'certainly.' and the soul which
orders all things must also order the heavens? 'of course.' one soul
or more? more; for less than two are inconceivable, one good, the other
evil. 'most true.' the soul directs all things by her movements, which
we call will, consideration, attention, deliberation, opinion true and
false, joy, sorrow, courage, fear, hatred, love, and similar affections.
these are the primary movements, and they receive the secondary
movements of bodies, and guide all things to increase and diminution,
separation and union, and to all the qualities which accompany
them--cold, hot, heavy, light, hard, soft, white, black, sweet, bitter;
these and other such qualities the soul, herself a goddess, uses, when
truly receiving the divine mind she leads all things rightly to their
happiness; but under the impulse of folly she works out an opposite
result. for the controller of heaven and earth and the circle of the
world is either the wise and good soul, or the foolish and vicious soul,
working in them. 'what do you mean?' if we say that the whole course
and motion of heaven and earth is in accordance with the workings and
reasonings of mind, clearly the best soul must have the care of the
heaven, and guide it along that better way. 'true.' but if the heavens
move wildly and disorderly, then they must be under the guidance of the
evil soul. 'true again.' what is the nature of the movement of the soul?
we must not suppose that we can see and know the soul with our bodily
eyes, any more than we can fix them on the midday sun; it will be safer
to look at an image only. 'how do you mean?' let us find among the ten
kinds of motion an image of the motion of the mind. you remember, as
we said, that all things are divided into two classes; and some of them
were moved and some at rest. 'yes.' and of those which were moved, some
were moved in the same place, others in more places than one. 'just so.'
the motion which was in one place was circular, like the motion of a
spherical body; and such a motion in the same place, and in the same
relations, is an excellent image of the motion of mind. 'very true.' the
motion of the other sort, which has no fixed place or manner or relation
or order or proportion, is akin to folly and nonsense. 'very true.'
after what has been said, it is clear that, since the soul carries round
all things, some soul which is either very good or the opposite carries
round the circumference of heaven. but that soul can be no other than
the best. again, the soul carries round the sun, moon, and stars, and if
the sun has a soul, then either the soul of the sun is within and moves
the sun as the human soul moves the body; or, secondly, the sun is
contained in some external air or fire, which the soul provides and
through which she operates; or, thirdly, the course of the sun is guided
by the soul acting in a wonderful manner without a body. 'yes, in one
of those ways the soul must guide all things.' and this soul of the
sun, which is better than the sun, whether driving him in a chariot or
employing any other agency, is by every man called a god? 'yes, by every
man who has any sense.' and of the seasons, stars, moon, and year, in
like manner, it may be affirmed that the soul or souls from which they
derive their excellence are divine; and without insisting on the manner
of their working, no one can deny that all things are full of gods. 'no
one.' and now let us offer an alternative to him who denies that there
are gods. either he must show that the soul is not the origin of all
things, or he must live for the future in the belief that there are
gods.

next, as to the man who believes in the gods, but refuses to acknowledge
that they take care of human things--let him too have a word of
admonition. 'best of men,' we will say to him, 'some affinity to the
gods leads you to honour them and to believe in them. but you have heard
the happiness of wicked men sung by poets and admired by the world, and
this has drawn you away from your natural piety. or you have seen the
wicked growing old in prosperity, and leaving great offices to their
children; or you have watched the tyrant succeeding in his career of
crime; and considering all these things you have been led to believe in
an irrational way that the gods take no care of human affairs. that your
error may not increase, i will endeavour to purify your soul.' do you,
megillus and cleinias, make answer for the youth, and when we come to
a difficulty, i will carry you over the water as i did before. 'very
good.' he will easily be convinced that the gods care for the small as
well as the great; for he heard what was said of their goodness and of
their having all things under their care. 'he certainly heard.' then now
let us enquire what is meant by the virtue of the gods. to possess mind
belongs to virtue, and the contrary to vice. 'that is what we say.' and
is not courage a part of virtue, and cowardice of vice? 'certainly.'
and to the gods we ascribe virtues; but idleness and indolence are not
virtues. 'of course not.' and is god to be conceived of as a careless,
indolent fellow, such as the poet would compare to a stingless drone?
'impossible.' can we be right in praising any one who cares for great
matters and leaves the small to take care of themselves? whether god or
man, he who does so, must either think the neglect of such matters to be
of no consequence, or he is indolent and careless. for surely neither
of them can be charged with neglect if they fail to attend to something
which is beyond their power? 'certainly not.'

and now we will examine the two classes of offenders who admit that
there are gods, but say,--the one that they may be appeased, the other
that they take no care of small matters: do they not acknowledge that
the gods are omnipotent and omniscient, and also good and perfect?
'certainly.' then they cannot be indolent, for indolence is the
offspring of idleness, and idleness of cowardice, and there is no
cowardice in god. 'true.' if the gods neglect small matters, they must
either know or not know that such things are not to be regarded. but of
course they know that they should be regarded, and knowing, they
cannot be supposed to neglect their duty, overcome by the seductions
of pleasure or pain. 'impossible.' and do not all human things share in
soul, and is not man the most religious of animals and the possession
of the gods? and the gods, who are the best of owners, will surely
take care of their property, small or great. consider further, that the
greater the power of perception, the less the power of action. for it is
harder to see and hear the small than the great, but easier to control
them. suppose a physician who had to cure a patient--would he
ever succeed if he attended to the great and neglected the little?
'impossible.' is not life made up of littles?--the pilot, general,
householder, statesman, all attend to small matters; and the builder
will tell you that large stones do not lie well without small ones.
and god is not inferior to mortal craftsmen, who in proportion to their
skill are careful in the details of their work; we must not imagine the
best and wisest to be a lazy good-for-nothing, who wearies of his work
and hurries over small and easy matters. 'never, never!' he who charges
the gods with neglect has been forced to admit his error; but i should
like further to persuade him that the author of all has made every part
for the sake of the whole, and that the smallest part has an appointed
state of action or passion, and that the least action or passion of any
part has a presiding minister. you, we say to him, are a minute fraction
of this universe, created with a view to the whole; the world is not
made for you, but you for the world; for the good artist considers the
whole first, and afterwards the parts. and you are annoyed at not seeing
how you and the universe are all working together for the best, so
far as the laws of the common creation admit. the soul undergoes many
changes from her contact with bodies; and all that the player does is to
put the pieces into their right places. 'what do you mean?' i mean that
god acts in the way which is simplest and easiest. had each thing been
formed without any regard to the rest, the transposition of the cosmos
would have been endless; but now there is not much trouble in the
government of the world. for when the king saw the actions of the living
souls and bodies, and the virtue and vice which were in them, and the
indestructibility of the soul and body (although they were not eternal),
he contrived so to arrange them that virtue might conquer and vice be
overcome as far as possible; giving them a seat and room adapted to
them, but leaving the direction of their separate actions to men's own
wills, which make our characters to be what they are. 'that is very
probable.' all things which have a soul possess in themselves the
principle of change, and in changing move according to fate and law;
natures which have undergone lesser changes move on the surface; but
those which have changed utterly for the worse, sink into hades and the
infernal world. and in all great changes for good and evil which are
produced either by the will of the soul or the influence of others,
there is a change of place. the good soul, which has intercourse with
the divine nature, passes into a holier and better place; and the evil
soul, as she grows worse, changes her place for the worse. this,--as we
declare to the youth who fancies that he is neglected of the gods,--is
the law of divine justice--the worse to the worse, the better to the
better, like to like, in life and in death. and from this law no man
will ever boast that he has escaped. even if you say--'i am small,
and will creep into the earth,' or 'i am high, and will mount to
heaven'--you are not so small or so high that you shall not pay the
fitting penalty, either here or in the world below. this is also the
explanation of the seeming prosperity of the wicked, in whose actions
as in a mirror you imagined that you saw the neglect of the gods, not
considering that they make all things contribute to the whole. and
how then could you form any idea of true happiness?--if cleinias and
megillus and i have succeeded in persuading you that you know not what
you say about the gods, god will help you; but if there is still any
deficiency of proof, hear our answer to the third opponent.

enough has been said to prove that the gods exist and care for us;
that they can be propitiated, or that they receive gifts, is not to be
allowed or admitted for an instant. 'let us proceed with the argument.'
tell me, by the gods, i say, how the gods are to be propitiated by us?
are they not rulers, who may be compared to charioteers, pilots, perhaps
generals, or physicians providing against the assaults of disease,
husbandmen observing the perils of the seasons, shepherds watching their
flocks? to whom shall we compare them? we acknowledged that the world is
full both of good and evil, but having more of evil than of good. there
is an immortal conflict going on, in which gods and demigods are our
allies, and we their property; for injustice and folly and wickedness
make war in our souls upon justice and temperance and wisdom. there is
little virtue to be found on earth; and evil natures fawn upon the gods,
like wild beasts upon their keepers, and believe that they can win them
over by flattery and prayers. and this sin, which is termed dishonesty,
is to the soul what disease is to the body, what pestilence is to the
seasons, what injustice is to states. 'quite so.' and they who maintain
that the gods can be appeased must say that they forgive the sins of
men, if they are allowed to share in their spoils; as you might suppose
wolves to mollify the dogs by throwing them a portion of the prey. 'that
is the argument.' but let us apply our images to the gods--are they the
pilots who are won by gifts to wreck their own ships--or the charioteers
who are bribed to lose the race--or the generals, or doctors, or
husbandmen, who are perverted from their duty--or the dogs who
are silenced by wolves? 'god forbid.' are they not rather our best
guardians; and shall we suppose them to fall short even of a moderate
degree of human or even canine virtue, which will not betray justice for
reward? 'impossible.' he, then, who maintains such a doctrine, is the
most blasphemous of mankind.

and now our three points are proven; and we are agreed (1) that there
are gods, (2) that they care for men, (3) that they cannot be bribed
to do injustice. i have spoken warmly, from a fear lest this impiety of
theirs should lead to a perversion of life. and our warmth will not have
been in vain, if we have succeeded in persuading these men to abominate
themselves, and to change their ways. 'so let us hope.' then now that
the preamble is completed, we will make a proclamation commanding the
impious to renounce their evil ways; and in case they refuse, the law
shall be added:--if a man is guilty of impiety in word or deed, let
the bystander inform the magistrates, and let the magistrates bring the
offender before the court; and if any of the magistrates refuses to act,
he likewise shall be tried for impiety. any one who is found guilty of
such an offence shall be fined at the discretion of the court, and
shall also be punished by a term of imprisonment. there shall be three
prisons--one for common offences against life and property; another,
near by the spot where the nocturnal council will assemble, which is to
be called the 'house of reformation'; the third, to be situated in some
desolate region in the centre of the country, shall be called by a name
indicating retribution. there are three causes of impiety, and from each
of them spring impieties of two kinds, six in all. first, there is the
impiety of those who deny the existence of the gods; these may be honest
men, haters of evil, who are only dangerous because they talk loosely
about the gods and make others like themselves; but there is also a more
vicious class, who are full of craft and licentiousness. to this latter
belong diviners, jugglers, despots, demagogues, generals, hierophants
of private mysteries, and sophists. the first class shall be only
imprisoned and admonished. the second class should be put to death, if
they could be, many times over. the two other sorts of impiety, first of
those who deny the care of the gods, and secondly, of those who affirm
that they may be propitiated, have similar subdivisions, varying in
degree of guilt. those who have learnt to blaspheme from mere ignorance
shall be imprisoned in the house of reformation for five years at least,
and not allowed to see any one but members of the nocturnal council,
who shall converse with them touching their souls health. if any of the
prisoners come to their right mind, at the end of five years let them be
restored to sane company; but he who again offends shall die. as to
that class of monstrous natures who not only believe that the gods are
negligent, or may be propitiated, but pretend to practise on the souls
of quick and dead, and promise to charm the gods, and to effect the ruin
of houses and states--he, i say, who is guilty of these things, shall
be bound in the central prison, and shall have no intercourse with
any freeman, receiving only his daily rations of food from the public
slaves; and when he dies, let him be cast beyond the border; and if any
freeman assist to bury him, he shall be liable to a suit for impiety.
but the sins of the father shall not be visited upon his children, who,
like other orphans, shall be educated by the state. further, let there
be a general law which will have a tendency to repress impiety. no man
shall have religious services in his house, but he shall go with his
friends to pray and sacrifice in the temples. the reason of this is,
that religious institutions can only be framed by a great intelligence.
but women and weak men are always consecrating the event of the moment;
they are under the influence of dreams and apparitions, and they build
altars and temples in every village and in any place where they have
had a vision. the law is designed to prevent this, and also to deter men
from attempting to propitiate the gods by secret sacrifices, which
only multiply their sins. therefore let the law run:--no one shall
have private religious rites; and if a man or woman who has not been
previously noted for any impiety offend in this way, let them be
admonished to remove their rites to a public temple; but if the offender
be one of the obstinate sort, he shall be brought to trial before the
guardians, and if he be found guilty, let him die.

book xi. as to dealings between man and man, the principle of them is
simple--thou shalt not take what is not thine; and shalt do to others as
thou wouldst that they should do to thee. first, of treasure trove:--may
i never desire to find, or lift, if i find, or be induced by the counsel
of diviners to lift, a treasure which one who was not my ancestor has
laid down; for i shall not gain so much in money as i shall lose in
virtue. the saying, 'move not the immovable,' may be repeated in a
new sense; and there is a common belief which asserts that such deeds
prevent a man from having a family. to him who is careless of such
consequences, and, despising the word of the wise, takes up a treasure
which is not his--what will be done by the hand of the gods, god only
knows,--but i would have the first person who sees the offender, inform
the wardens of the city or the country; and they shall send to delphi
for a decision, and whatever the oracle orders, they shall carry out.
if the informer be a freeman, he shall be honoured, and if a slave,
set free; but he who does not inform, if he be a freeman, shall be
dishonoured, and if a slave, shall be put to death. if a man leave
anywhere anything great or small, intentionally or unintentionally, let
him who may find the property deem the deposit sacred to the goddess
of ways. and he who appropriates the same, if he be a slave, shall be
beaten with many stripes; if a freeman, he shall pay tenfold, and be
held to have done a dishonourable action. if a person says that another
has something of his, and the other allows that he has the property in
dispute, but maintains it to be his own, let the ownership be proved out
of the registers of property. if the property is registered as belonging
to some one who is absent, possession shall be given to him who offers
sufficient security on behalf of the absentee; or if the property is not
registered, let it remain with the three eldest magistrates, and if it
should be an animal, the defeated party must pay the cost of its keep. a
man may arrest his own slave, and he may also imprison for safe-keeping
the runaway slave of a friend. any one interfering with him must produce
three sureties; otherwise, he will be liable to an action for violence,
and if he be cast, must pay a double amount of damages to him from whom
he has taken the slave. a freedman who does not pay due respect to his
patron, may also be seized. due respect consists in going three times
a month to the house of his patron, and offering to perform any lawful
service for him; he must also marry as his master pleases; and if his
property be greater than his master's, he must hand over to him the
excess. a freedman may not remain in the state, except with the consent
of the magistrates and of his master, for more than twenty years; and
whenever his census exceeds that of the third class, he must in any case
leave the country within thirty days, taking his property with him. if
he break this regulation, the penalty shall be death, and his property
shall be confiscated. suits about these matters are to be decided in the
courts of the tribes, unless the parties have settled the matter before
a court of neighbours or before arbiters. if anybody claim a beast, or
anything else, let the possessor refer to the seller or giver of the
property within thirty days, if the latter reside in the city, or, if
the goods have been received from a stranger, within five months, of
which the middle month shall include the summer solstice. all purchases
and exchanges are to be made in the agora, and paid for on the spot; the
law will not allow credit to be given. no law shall protect the money
subscribed for clubs. he who sells anything of greater value than fifty
drachmas shall abide in the city for ten days, and let his whereabouts
be known to the buyer, in case of any reclamation. when a slave is sold
who is subject to epilepsy, stone, or any other invisible disorder, the
buyer, if he be a physician or trainer, or if he be warned, shall have
no redress; but in other cases within six months, or within twelve
months in epileptic disorders, he may bring the matter before a jury of
physicians to be agreed upon by both parties; and the seller who loses
the suit, if he be an expert, shall pay twice the price; or if he be
a private person, the bargain shall be rescinded, and he shall simply
refund. if a person knowingly sells a homicide to another, who is
informed of his character, there is no redress. but if the judges--who
are to be the five youngest guardians of the law--decide that the
purchaser was not aware, then the seller is to pay threefold, and to
purify the house of the buyer.

he who exchanges money for money, or beast for beast, must warrant
either of them to be sound and good. as in the case of other laws, let
us have a preamble, relating to all this class of crime. adulteration
is a kind of falsehood about which the many commonly say that at proper
times the practice may often be right, but they do not define at what
times. but the legislator will tell them, that no man should invoke the
gods when he is practising deceit or fraud, in word or deed. for he is
the enemy of heaven, first, who swears falsely, not thinking of the gods
by whom he swears, and secondly, he who lies to his superiors. (now
the superiors are the betters of inferiors,--the elder of the younger,
parents of children, men of women, and rulers of subjects.) the trader
who cheats in the agora is a liar and is perjured--he respects neither
the name of god nor the regulations of the magistrates. if after hearing
this he will still be dishonest, let him listen to the law:--the seller
shall not have two prices on the same day, neither must he puff his
goods, nor offer to swear about them. if he break the law, any citizen
not less than thirty years of age may smite him. if he sell adulterated
goods, the slave or metic who informs against him shall have the goods;
the citizen who brings such a charge, if he prove it, shall offer up the
goods in question to the gods of the agora; or if he fail to prove it,
shall be dishonoured. he who is detected in selling adulterated goods
shall be deprived of them, and shall receive a stripe for every drachma
of their value. the wardens of the agora and the guardians of the law
shall take experienced persons into counsel, and draw up regulations for
the agora. these shall be inscribed on a column in front of the court
of the wardens of the agora.--as to the wardens of the city, enough
has been said already. but if any omissions in the law are afterwards
discovered, the wardens and the guardians shall supply them, and have
them inscribed after the original regulations on a column before the
court of the wardens of the city.

next in order follows the subject of retail trades, which in their
natural use are the reverse of mischievous; for every man is a
benefactor who reduces what is unequal to symmetry and proportion. money
is the instrument by which this is accomplished, and the shop-keeper,
the merchant, and hotel-keeper do but supply the wants and equalize
the possessions of mankind. why, then, does any dishonour attach to
a beneficent occupation? let us consider the nature of the accusation
first, and then see whether it can be removed. 'what is your drift?'
dear cleinias, there are few men who are so gifted by nature, and
improved by education, as to be able to control the desire of making
money; or who are sober in their wishes and prefer moderation to
accumulation. the great majority think that they can never have enough,
and the consequence is that retail trade has become a reproach. whereas,
however ludicrous the idea may seem, if noble men and noble women could
be induced to open a shop, and to trade upon incorruptible principles,
then the aspect of things would change, and retail traders would be
regarded as nursing fathers and mothers. in our own day the trader
goes and settles in distant places, and receives the weary traveller
hospitably at first, but in the end treats him as an enemy and a
captive, whom he only liberates for an enormous ransom. this is what
has brought retail trade into disrepute, and against this the legislator
ought to provide. men have said of old, that to fight against two
opponents is hard; and the two opponents of whom i am thinking are
wealth and poverty--the one corrupting men by luxury; the other, through
misery, depriving them of the sense of shame. what remedies can a city
find for this disease? first, to have as few retail traders as possible;
secondly, to give retail trade over to a class whose corruption will not
injure the state; and thirdly, to restrain the insolence and meanness of
the retailers.

let us make the following laws:--(1) in the city of the magnetes none of
the 5040 citizens shall be a retailer or merchant, or do any service to
any private persons who do not equally serve him, except to his father
and mother and their fathers and mothers, and generally to his elders
who are freemen, and whom he serves as a freeman. he who follows an
illiberal pursuit may be cited for dishonouring his family, and kept
in bonds for a year; and if he offend again, he shall be bound for two
years; and for every offence his punishment shall be doubled: (2) every
retailer shall be a metic or a foreigner: (3) the guardians of the law
shall have a special care of this part of the community, whose calling
exposes them to peculiar temptations. they shall consult with persons of
experience, and find out what prices will yield the traders a moderate
profit, and fix them.

when a man does not fulfil his contract, he being under no legal or
other impediment, the case shall be brought before the court of the
tribes, if not previously settled by arbitration. the class of artisans
is consecrated to hephaestus and athene; the makers of weapons to ares
and athene: all of whom, remembering that the gods are their ancestors,
should be ashamed to deceive in the practice of their craft. if any man
is lazy in the fulfilment of his work, and fancies, foolish fellow, that
his patron god will not deal hardly with him, he will be punished by the
god; and let the law follow:--he who fails in his undertaking shall pay
the value, and do the work gratis in a specified time. the contractor,
like the seller, is enjoined by law to charge the simple value of his
work; in a free city, art should be a true thing, and the artist must
not practise on the ignorance of others. on the other hand, he who has
ordered any work and does not pay the workman according to agreement,
dishonours zeus and athene, and breaks the bonds of society. and if
he does not pay at the time agreed, let him pay double; and although
interest is forbidden in other cases, let the workman receive after the
expiration of a year interest at the rate of an obol a month for every
drachma (equal to 200 per cent. per ann.). and we may observe by the
way, in speaking of craftsmen, that if our military craft do their work
well, the state will praise those who honour them, and blame those who
do not honour them. not that the first place of honour is to be assigned
to the warrior; a higher still is reserved for those who obey the laws.

most of the dealings between man and man are now settled, with the
exception of such as relate to orphans and guardianships. these lead
us to speak of the intentions of the dying, about which we must make
regulations. i say 'must'; for mankind cannot be allowed to dispose of
their property as they please, in ways at variance with one another and
with law and custom. but a dying person is a strange being, and is not
easily managed; he wants to be master of all he has, and is apt to use
angry words. he will say,--'may i not do what i will with my own, and
give much to my friends, and little to my enemies?' 'there is reason
in that.' o cleinias, in my judgment the older lawgivers were too
soft-hearted, and wanting in insight into human affairs. they were
too ready to listen to the outcry of a dying man, and hence they were
induced to give him an absolute power of bequest. but i would say to
him:--o creature of a day, you know neither what is yours nor yourself:
for you and your property are not your own, but belong to your whole
family, past and to come, and property and family alike belong to the
state. and therefore i must take out of your hands the charge of what
you leave behind you, with a view to the interests of all. and i hope
that you will not quarrel with us, now that you are going the way of all
mankind; we will do our best for you and yours when you are no longer
here. let this be our address to the living and dying, and let the law
be as follows:--the father who has sons shall appoint one of them to be
the heir of the lot; and if he has given any other son to be adopted by
another, the adoption shall also be recorded; and if he has still a son
who has no lot, and has a chance of going to a colony, he may give him
what he has more than the lot; or if he has more than one son unprovided
for, he may divide the money between them. a son who has a house of his
own, and a daughter who is betrothed, are not to share in the bequest of
money; and the son or daughter who, having inherited one lot, acquires
another, is to bequeath the new inheritance to the next of kin. if a man
have only daughters, he may adopt the husband of any one of them; or if
he have lost a son, let him make mention of the circumstance in his will
and adopt another. if he have no children, he may give away a tenth of
his acquired property to whomsoever he likes; but he must adopt an heir
to inherit the lot, and may leave the remainder to him. also he may
appoint guardians for his children; or if he die without appointing them
or without making a will, the nearest kinsmen,--two on the father's
and two on the mother's side,--and one friend of the departed, shall be
appointed guardians. the fifteen eldest guardians of the law are to have
special charge of all orphans, the whole number of fifteen being
divided into bodies of three, who will succeed one another according
to seniority every year for five years. if a man dying intestate leave
daughters, he must pardon the law which marries them for looking, first
to kinship, and secondly to the preservation of the lot. the legislator
cannot regard the character of the heir, which to the father is the
first consideration. the law will therefore run as follows:--if the
intestate leave daughters, husbands are to be found for them among
their kindred according to the following table of affinity: first,
their father's brothers; secondly, the sons of their father's brothers;
thirdly, of their father's sisters; fourthly, their great-uncles;
fifthly, the sons of a great-uncle; sixthly, the sons of a great-aunt.
the kindred in such cases shall always be reckoned in this way; the
relationship shall proceed upwards through brothers and sisters and
brothers' and sisters' children, and first the male line must be taken
and then the female. if there is a dispute in regard to fitness of
age for marriage, this the judge shall decide, after having made an
inspection of the youth naked, and of the maiden naked down to the
waist. if the maiden has no relations within the degree of third cousin,
she may choose whom she likes, with the consent of her guardians; or she
may even select some one who has gone to a colony, and he, if he be a
kinsman, will take the lot by law; if not, he must have her guardians'
consent, as well as hers. when a man dies without children and without
a will, let a young man and a young woman go forth from the family and
take up their abode in the desolate house. the woman shall be selected
from the kindred in the following order of succession:--first, a
sister of the deceased; second, a brother's daughter; third, a sister's
daughter; fourth, a father's sister; fifth, a daughter of a father's
brother; sixth, a daughter of a father's sister. for the man the
same order shall be observed as in the preceding case. the legislator
foresees that laws of this kind will sometimes press heavily, and that
his intention cannot always be fulfilled; as for example, when there are
mental and bodily defects in the persons who are enjoined to marry. but
he must be excused for not being always able to reconcile the general
principles of public interest with the particular circumstances of
individuals; and he is willing to allow, in like manner, that the
individual cannot always do what the lawgiver wishes. and then arbiters
must be chosen, who will determine equitably the cases which may arise
under the law: e.g. a rich cousin may sometimes desire a grander match,
or the requirements of the law can only be fulfilled by marrying a
madwoman. to meet such cases let the following law be enacted:--if any
one comes forward and says that the lawgiver, had he been alive, would
not have required the carrying out of the law in a particular case, let
him go to the fifteen eldest guardians of the law who have the care of
orphans; but if he thinks that too much power is thus given to them, he
may bring the case before the court of select judges.

thus will orphans have a second birth. in order to make their sad
condition as light as possible, the guardians of the law shall be
their parents, and shall be admonished to take care of them. and what
admonition can be more appropriate than the assurance which we formerly
gave, that the souls of the dead watch over mortal affairs? about this
there are many ancient traditions, which may be taken on trust from the
legislator. let men fear, in the first place, the gods above; secondly,
the souls of the departed, who naturally care for their own descendants;
thirdly, the aged living, who are quick to hear of any neglect of family
duties, especially in the case of orphans. for they are the holiest
and most sacred of all deposits, and the peculiar care of guardians and
magistrates; and those who try to bring them up well will contribute
to their own good and to that of their families. he who listens to the
preamble of the law will never know the severity of the legislator; but
he who disobeys, and injures the orphan, will pay twice the penalty he
would have paid if the parents had been alive. more laws might have been
made about orphans, did we not suppose that the guardians have children
and property of their own which are protected by the laws; and the duty
of the guardian in our state is the same as that of a father, though
his honour or disgrace is greater. a legal admonition and threat may,
however, be of service: the guardian of the orphan and the guardian of
the law who is over him, shall love the orphan as their own children,
and take more care of his or her property than of their own. if the
guardian of the child neglect his duty, the guardian of the law shall
fine him; and the guardian may also have the magistrate tried for
neglect in the court of select judges, and he shall pay, if convicted,
a double penalty. further, the guardian of the orphan who is careless
or dishonest may be fined on the information of any of the citizens in a
fourfold penalty, half to go to the orphan and half to the prosecutor
of the suit. when the orphan is of age, if he thinks that he has been
ill-used, his guardian may be brought to trial by him within five years,
and the penalty shall be fixed by the court. or if the magistrate
has neglected the orphan, he shall pay damages to him; but if he have
defrauded him, he shall make compensation and also be deposed from his
office of guardian of the law.

if irremediable differences arise between fathers and sons, the father
may want to renounce his son, or the son may indict his father for
imbecility: such violent separations only take place when the family are
'a bad lot'; if only one of the two parties is bad, the differences do
not grow to so great a height. but here arises a difficulty. although
in any other state a son who is disinherited does not cease to be a
citizen, in ours he does; for the number of citizens cannot exceed 5040.
and therefore he who is to suffer such a penalty ought to be abjured,
not only by his father, but by the whole family. the law, then, should
run as follows:--if any man's evil fortune or temper incline him to
disinherit his son, let him not do so lightly or on the instant; but let
him have a council of his own relations and of the maternal relations of
his son, and set forth to them the propriety of disinheriting him, and
allow his son to answer. and if more than half of the kindred male and
female, being of full age, condemn the son, let him be disinherited.
if any other citizen desires to adopt him, he may, for young men's
characters often change in the course of life. but if, after ten years,
he remains unadopted, let him be sent to a colony. if disease, or old
age, or evil disposition cause a man to go out of his mind, and he is
ruining his house and property, and his son doubts about indicting him
for insanity, let him lay the case before the eldest guardians of the
law, and consult with them. and if they advise him to proceed, and the
father is decided to be imbecile, he shall have no more control over his
property, but shall live henceforward like a child in the house.

if a man and his wife are of incompatible tempers, ten guardians of the
law and ten of the matrons who regulate marriage shall take their case
in hand, and reconcile them, if possible. if, however, their swelling
souls cannot be pacified, the wife may try and find a new husband, and
the husband a new wife; probably they are not very gentle creatures, and
should therefore be joined to milder natures. the younger of those
who are separated should also select their partners with a view to the
procreation of children; while the older should seek a companion for
their declining years. if a woman dies, leaving children male or female,
the law will advise, but not compel, the widower to abstain from a
second marriage; if she leave no children, he shall be compelled to
marry. also a widow, if she is not old enough to live honestly without
marriage, shall marry again; and in case she have no children, she
should marry for the sake of them. there is sometimes an uncertainty
which parent the offspring is to follow: in unions of a female slave
with a male slave, or with a freedman or free man, or of a free woman
with a male slave, the offspring is to belong to the master; but if the
master or mistress be themselves the parent of the child, the slave and
the child are to be sent away to another land.

concerning duty to parents, let the preamble be as follows:--we honour
the gods in their lifeless images, and believe that we thus propitiate
them. but he who has an aged father or mother has a living image, which
if he cherish it will do him far more good than any statue. 'what do
you mean by cherishing them?' i will tell you. oedipus and amyntor and
theseus cursed their children, and their curses took effect. this proves
that the gods hear the curses of parents who are wronged; and shall we
doubt that they hear and fulfil their blessings too?' 'surely not.' and,
as we were saying, no image is more honoured by the gods than an aged
father and mother, to whom when honour is done, the god who hears their
prayers is rejoiced, and their influence is greater than that of the
lifeless statue; for they pray that good or evil may come to us in
proportion as they are honoured or dishonoured, but the statue is
silent. 'excellent.' good men are glad when their parents live to
extreme old age, or if they depart early, lament their loss; but to bad
man their parents are always terrible. wherefore let every one honour
his parents, and if this preamble fails of influencing him, let him hear
the law:--if any one does not take sufficient care of his parents, let
the aggrieved person inform the three eldest guardians of the law and
three of the women who are concerned with marriages. women up to forty
years of age, and men up to thirty, who thus offend, shall be beaten
and imprisoned. after that age they are to be brought before a court
composed of the eldest citizens, who may inflict any punishment upon
them which they please. if the injured party cannot inform, let any
freeman who hears of the case inform; a slave who does so shall be
set free,--if he be the slave of the one of the parties, by the
magistrate,--if owned by another, at the cost of the state; and let the
magistrates, take care that he is not wronged by any one out of revenge.

the injuries which one person does to another by the use of poisons
are of two kinds;--one affects the body by the employment of drugs and
potions; the other works on the mind by the practice of sorcery and
magic. fatal cases of either sort have been already mentioned; and now
we must have a law respecting cases which are not fatal. there is no use
in arguing with a man whose mind is disturbed by waxen images placed at
his own door, or on the sepulchre of his father or mother, or at a spot
where three ways meet. but to the wizards themselves we must address
a solemn preamble, begging them not to treat the world as if they were
children, or compel the legislator to expose them, and to show men that
the poisoner who is not a physician and the wizard who is not a prophet
or diviner are equally ignorant of what they are doing. let the law be
as follows:--he who by the use of poison does any injury not fatal to
a man or his servants, or any injury whether fatal or not to another's
cattle or bees, is to be punished with death if he be a physician, and
if he be not a physician he is to suffer the punishment awarded by the
court: and he who injures another by sorcery, if he be a diviner or
prophet, shall be put to death; and, if he be not a diviner, the court
shall determine what he ought to pay or suffer.

any one who injures another by theft or violence shall pay damages at
least equal to the injury; and besides the compensation, a suitable
punishment shall be inflicted. the foolish youth who is the victim of
others is to have a lighter punishment; he whose folly is occasioned
by his own jealousy or desire or anger is to suffer more heavily.
punishment is to be inflicted, not for the sake of vengeance, for
what is done cannot be undone, but for the sake of prevention and
reformation. and there should be a proportion between the punishment and
the crime, in which the judge, having a discretion left him, must,
by estimating the crime, second the legislator, who, like a painter,
furnishes outlines for him to fill up.

a madman is not to go about at large in the city, but is to be taken
care of by his relatives. neglect on their part is to be punished in the
first class by a fine of a hundred drachmas, and proportionally in
the others. now madness is of various kinds; in addition to that
which arises from disease there is the madness which originates in a
passionate temperament, and makes men when engaged in a quarrel use
foul and abusive language against each other. this is intolerable in a
well-ordered state; and therefore our law shall be as follows:--no one
is to speak evil of another, but when men differ in opinion they are to
instruct one another without speaking evil. nor should any one seek
to rouse the passions which education has calmed; for he who feeds and
nurses his wrath is apt to make ribald jests at his opponent, with a
loss of character or dignity to himself. and for this reason no one may
use any abusive word in a temple, or at sacrifices, or games, or in
any public assembly, and he who offends shall be censured by the proper
magistrate; and the magistrate, if he fail to censure him, shall not
claim the prize of virtue. in any other place the angry man who indulges
in revilings, whether he be the beginner or not, may be chastised by an
elder. the reviler is always trying to make his opponent ridiculous; and
the use of ridicule in anger we cannot allow. we forbid the comic poet
to ridicule our citizens, under a penalty of expulsion from the country
or a fine of three minae. jest in which there is no offence may be
allowed; but the question of offence shall be determined by the director
of education, who is to be the licenser of theatrical performances.

the righteous man who is in adversity will not be allowed to starve in a
well-ordered city; he will never be a beggar. nor is a man to be pitied,
merely because he is hungry, unless he be temperate. therefore let the
law be as follows:--let there be no beggars in our state; and he who
begs shall be expelled by the magistrates both from town and country.

if a slave, male or female, does any harm to the property of another,
who is not himself a party to the harm, the master shall compensate the
injury or give up the offending slave. but if the master argue that the
charge has arisen by collusion, with the view of obtaining the slave,
he may put the plaintiff on his trial for malpractices, and recover from
him twice the value of the slave; or if he is cast he must make good
the damage and deliver up the slave. the injury done by a horse or other
animal shall be compensated in like manner.

a witness who will not come of himself may be summoned, and if he fail
in appearing, he shall be liable for any harm which may ensue: if he
swears that he does not know, he may leave the court. a judge who is
called upon as a witness must not vote. a free woman, if she is over
forty, may bear witness and plead, and, if she have no husband, she may
also bring an action. a slave, male or female, and a child may witness
and plead only in case of murder, but they must give sureties that they
will appear at the trial, if they should be charged with false witness.
such charges must be made pending the trial, and the accusations shall
be sealed by both parties and kept by the magistrates until the trial
for perjury comes off. if a man is twice convicted of perjury, he is not
to be required, if three times, he is not to be allowed to bear witness,
or, if he persists in bearing witness, is to be punished with death.
when more than half the evidence is proved to be false there must be a
new trial.

the best and noblest things in human life are liable to be defiled and
perverted. is not justice the civilizer of mankind? and yet upon the
noble profession of the advocate has come an evil name. for he is said
to make the worse appear the better cause, and only requires money
in return for his services. such an art will be forbidden by the
legislator, and if existing among us will be requested to depart to
another city. to the disobedient let the voice of the law be heard
saying:--he who tries to pervert justice in the minds of the judges, or
to increase litigation, shall be brought before the supreme court. if he
does so from contentiousness, let him be silenced for a time, and, if
he offend again, put to death. if he have acted from a love of gain,
let him be sent out of the country if he be a foreigner, or if he be a
citizen let him be put to death.

book xii. if a false message be taken to or brought from other states,
whether friendly or hostile, by ambassadors or heralds, they shall be
indicted for having dishonoured their sacred office, and, if convicted,
shall suffer a penalty.--stealing is mean; robbery is shameless. let no
man deceive himself by the supposed example of the gods, for no god or
son of a god ever really practised either force or fraud. on this point
the legislator is better informed than all the poets put together. he
who listens to him shall be for ever happy, but he who will not listen
shall have the following law directed against him:--he who steals much,
or he who steals little of the public property is deserving of the same
penalty; for they are both impelled by the same evil motive. when the
law punishes one man more lightly than another, this is done under the
idea, not that he is less guilty, but that he is more curable. now a
thief who is a foreigner or slave may be curable; but the thief who is
a citizen, and has had the advantages of education, should be put to
death, for he is incurable.

much consideration and many regulations are necessary about military
expeditions; the great principal of all is that no one, male or
female, in war or peace, in great matters or small, shall be without a
commander. whether men stand or walk, or drill, or pursue, or retreat,
or wash, or eat, they should all act together and in obedience to
orders. we should practise from our youth upwards the habits of command
and obedience. all dances, relaxations, endurances of meats and drinks,
of cold and heat, and of hard couches, should have a view to war, and
care should be taken not to destroy the natural covering and use of the
head and feet by wearing shoes and caps; for the head is the lord of
the body, and the feet are the best of servants. the soldier should have
thoughts like these; and let him hear the law:--he who is enrolled shall
serve, and if he absent himself without leave he shall be indicted for
failure of service before his own branch of the army when the expedition
returns, and if he be found guilty he shall suffer the penalty which the
courts award, and never be allowed to contend for any prize of valour,
or to accuse another of misbehaviour in military matters. desertion
shall also be tried and punished in the same manner. after the courts
for trying failure of service and desertion have been held, the generals
shall hold another court, in which the several arms of the service will
award prizes for the expedition which has just concluded. the prize is
to be a crown of olive, which the victor shall offer up at the temple
of his favourite war god...in any suit which a man brings, let the
indictment be scrupulously true, for justice is an honourable maiden,
to whom falsehood is naturally hateful. for example, when men are
prosecuted for having lost their arms, great care should be taken by the
witnesses to distinguish between cases in which they have been lost from
necessity and from cowardice. if the hero patroclus had not been killed
but had been brought back alive from the field, he might have been
reproached with having lost the divine armour. and a man may lose
his arms in a storm at sea, or from a fall, and under many other
circumstances. there is a distinction of language to be observed in the
use of the two terms, 'thrower away of a shield' (ripsaspis), and 'loser
of arms' (apoboleus oplon), one being the voluntary, the other the
involuntary relinquishment of them. let the law then be as follows:--if
any one is overtaken by the enemy, having arms in his hands, and he
leaves them behind him voluntarily, choosing base life instead of
honourable death, let justice be done. the old legend of caeneus, who
was changed by poseidon from a woman into a man, may teach by contraries
the appropriate punishment. let the thrower away of his shield be
changed from a man into a woman--that is to say, let him be all his life
out of danger, and never again be admitted by any commander into the
ranks of his army; and let him pay a heavy fine according to his class.
and any commander who permits him to serve shall also be punished by a
fine.

all magistrates, whatever be their tenure of office, must give an
account of their magistracy. but where shall we find the magistrate who
is worthy to supervise them or look into their short-comings and crooked
ways? the examiner must be more than man who is sufficient for these
things. for the truth is that there are many causes of the dissolution
of states; which, like ships or animals, have their cords, and girders,
and sinews easily relaxed, and nothing tends more to their welfare and
preservation than the supervision of them by examiners who are better
than the magistrates; failing in this they fall to pieces, and each
becomes many instead of one. wherefore let the people meet after the
summer solstice, in the precincts of apollo and the sun, and appoint
three men of not less than fifty years of age. they shall proceed as
follows:--each citizen shall select some one, not himself, whom he
thinks the best. the persons selected shall be reduced to one half, who
have the greatest number of votes, if they are an even number; but if an
odd number, he who has the smallest number of votes shall be previously
withdrawn. the voting shall continue in the same manner until three only
remain; and if the number of votes cast for them be equal, a distinction
between the first, second, and third shall be made by lot. the three
shall be crowned with an olive wreath, and proclamation made, that the
city of the magnetes, once more preserved by the gods, presents her
three best men to apollo and the sun, to whom she dedicates them as long
as their lives answer to the judgment formed of them. they shall choose
in the first year of their office twelve examiners, to continue until
they are seventy-five years of age; afterwards three shall be added
annually. while they hold office, they shall dwell within the precinct
of the god. they are to divide all the magistracies into twelve classes,
and may apply any methods of enquiry, and inflict any punishments which
they please; in some cases singly, in other cases together, announcing
the acquittal or punishment of the magistrate on a tablet which they
will place in the agora. a magistrate who has been condemned by the
examiners may appeal to the select judges, and, if he gain his suit,
may in turn prosecute the examiners; but if the appellant is cast,
his punishment shall be doubled, unless he was previously condemned to
death.

and what honours shall be paid to these examiners, whom the whole state
counts worthy of the rewards of virtue? they shall have the first place
at all sacrifices and other ceremonies, and in all assemblies and
public places; they shall go on sacred embassies, and have the exclusive
privilege of wearing a crown of laurel. they are priests of apollo
and the sun, and he of their number who is judged first shall be high
priest, and give his name to the year. the manner of their burial, too,
shall be different from that of the other citizens. the colour of their
funeral array shall be white, and, instead of the voice of lamentation,
around the bier shall stand a chorus of fifteen boys and fifteen
maidens, chanting hymns in honour of the deceased in alternate strains
during an entire day; and at dawn a band of a hundred youths shall carry
the bier to the grave, marching in the garb of warriors, and the boys in
front of the bier shall sing their national hymn, while the maidens and
women past child-bearing follow after. priests and priestesses may also
follow, unless the pythian oracle forbids. the sepulchre shall be a
vault built underground, which will last for ever, having couches of
stone placed side by side; on one of these they shall lay the departed
saint, and then cover the tomb with a mound, and plant trees on every
side except one, where an opening shall be left for other interments.
every year there shall be games--musical, gymnastic, or equestrian, in
honour of those who have passed every ordeal. but if any of them, after
having been acquitted on any occasion, begin to show the wickedness
of human nature, he who pleases may bring them to trial before a court
composed of the guardians of the law, and of the select judges, and
of any of the examiners who are alive. if he be convicted he shall be
deprived of his honours, and if the accuser do not obtain a fifth part
of the votes, he shall pay a fine according to his class.

what is called the judgment of rhadamanthus is suited to 'ages of
faith,' but not to our days. he knew that his contemporaries believed
in the gods, for many of them were the sons of gods; and he thought that
the easiest and surest method of ending litigation was to commit the
decision to heaven. in our own day, men either deny the existence
of gods or their care of men, or maintain that they may be bribed by
attentions and gifts; and the procedure of rhadamanthus would therefore
be out of date. when the religious ideas of mankind change, their laws
should also change. thus oaths should no longer be taken from plaintiff
and defendant; simple statements of affirmation and denial should be
substituted. for there is something dreadful in the thought, that nearly
half the citizens of a state are perjured men. there is no objection
to an oath, where a man has no interest in forswearing himself; as, for
example, when a judge is about to give his decision, or in voting at
an election, or in the judgment of games and contests. but where
there would be a premium on perjury, oaths and imprecations should be
prohibited as irrelevant, like appeals to feeling. let the principles of
justice be learned and taught without words of evil omen. the oaths of
a stranger against a stranger may be allowed, because strangers are not
permitted to become permanent residents in our state.

trials in private causes are to be decided in the same manner as lesser
offences against the state. the non-attendance at a chorus or sacrifice,
or the omission to pay a war-tax, may be regarded as in the first
instance remediable, and the defaulter may give security; but if he
forfeits the security, the goods pledged shall be sold and the money
given to the state. and for obstinate disobedience, the magistrate shall
have the power of inflicting greater penalties.

a city which is without trade or commerce must consider what it will do
about the going abroad of its own people and the admission of strangers.
for out of intercourse with strangers there arises great confusion of
manners, which in most states is not of any consequence, because the
confusion exists already; but in a well-ordered state it may be a great
evil. yet the absolute prohibition of foreign travel, or the exclusion
of strangers, is impossible, and would appear barbarous to the rest of
mankind. public opinion should never be lightly regarded, for the many
are not so far wrong in their judgments as in their lives. even the
worst of men have often a divine instinct, which enables them to judge
of the differences between the good and bad. states are rightly advised
when they desire to have the praise of men; and the greatest and truest
praise is that of virtue. and our cretan colony should, and probably
will, have a character for virtue, such as few cities have. let
this, then, be our law about foreign travel and the reception of
strangers:--no one shall be allowed to leave the country who is under
forty years of age--of course military service abroad is not included in
this regulation--and no one at all except in a public capacity. to the
olympic, and pythian, and nemean, and isthmian games, shall be sent the
fairest and best and bravest, who shall support the dignity of the city
in time of peace. these, when they come home, shall teach the youth the
inferiority of all other governments. besides those who go on sacred
missions, other persons shall be sent out by permission of the guardians
to study the institutions of foreign countries. for a people which has
no experience, and no knowledge of the characters of men or the reason
of things, but lives by habit only, can never be perfectly civilized.
moreover, in all states, bad as well as good, there are holy and
inspired men; these the citizen of a well-ordered city should be ever
seeking out; he should go forth to find them over sea and over land,
that he may more firmly establish institutions in his own state which
are good already and amend the bad. 'what will be the best way of
accomplishing such an object?' in the first place, let the visitor of
foreign countries be between fifty and sixty years of age, and let him
be a citizen of repute, especially in military matters. on his return
he shall appear before the nocturnal council: this is a body which sits
from dawn to sunrise, and includes amongst its members the priests who
have gained the prize of virtue, and the ten oldest guardians of the
law, and the director and past directors of education; each of whom has
power to bring with him a younger friend of his own selection, who is
between thirty and forty. the assembly thus constituted shall consider
the laws of their own and other states, and gather information relating
to them. anything of the sort which is approved by the elder members of
the council shall be studied with all diligence by the younger; who are
to be specially watched by the rest of the citizens, and shall receive
honour, if they are deserving of honour, or dishonour, if they prove
inferior. this is the assembly to which the visitor of foreign countries
shall come and tell anything which he has heard from others in the
course of his travels, or which he has himself observed. if he be made
neither better nor worse, let him at least be praised for his zeal; and
let him receive still more praise, and special honour after death, if
he be improved. but if he be deteriorated by his travels, let him be
prohibited from speaking to any one; and if he submit, he may live as
a private individual: but if he be convicted of attempting to make
innovations in education and the laws, let him die.

next, as to the reception of strangers. of these there are four
classes:--first, merchants, who, like birds of passage, find their way
over the sea at a certain time of the year, that they may exhibit their
wares. these should be received in markets and public buildings without
the city, by proper officers, who shall see that justice is done them,
and shall also watch against any political designs which they may
entertain; no more intercourse is to be held with them than is
absolutely necessary. secondly, there are the visitors at the festivals,
who shall be entertained by hospitable persons at the temples for a
reasonable time; the priests and ministers of the temples shall have
a care of them. in small suits brought by them or against them, the
priests shall be the judges; but in the more important, the wardens of
the agora. thirdly, there are ambassadors of foreign states; these are
to be honourably received by the generals and commanders, and placed
under the care of the prytanes and of the persons with whom they are
lodged. fourthly, there is the philosophical stranger, who, like our
own spectators, from time to time goes to see what is rich and rare in
foreign countries. like them he must be fifty years of age: and let him
go unbidden to the doors of the wise and rich, that he may learn from
them, and they from him.

these are the rules of missions into foreign countries, and of the
reception of strangers. let zeus, the god of hospitality, be honoured;
and let not the stranger be excluded, as in egypt, from meals and
sacrifices, or, (as at sparta,) driven away by savage proclamations.

let guarantees be clearly given in writing and before witnesses. the
number of witnesses shall be three when the sum lent is under a thousand
drachmas, or five when above. the agent and principal at a fraudulent
sale shall be equally liable. he who would search another man's house
for anything must swear that he expects to find it there; and he shall
enter naked, or having on a single garment and no girdle. the owner
shall place at the disposal of the searcher all his goods, sealed as
well as unsealed; if he refuse, he shall be liable in double the value
of the property, if it shall prove to be in his possession. if the owner
be absent, the searcher may counter-seal the property which is under
seal, and place watchers. if the owner remain absent more than five
days, the searcher shall take the magistrates, and open the sealed
property, and seal it up again in their presence. the recovery of goods
disputed, except in the case of lands and houses, (about which there
can be no dispute in our state), is to be barred by time. the public and
unimpeached use of anything for a year in the city, or for five years in
the country, or the private possession and domestic use for three years
in the city, or for ten years in the country, is to give a right of
ownership. but if the possessor have the property in a foreign country,
there shall be no bar as to time. the proceedings of any trial are to
be void, in which either the parties or the witnesses, whether bond or
free, have been prevented by violence from attending:--if a slave be
prevented, the suit shall be invalid; or if a freeman, he who is guilty
of the violence shall be imprisoned for a year, and shall also be liable
to an action for kidnapping. if one competitor forcibly prevents another
from attending at the games, the other may be inscribed as victor in
the temples, and the first, whether victor or not, shall be liable to an
action for damages. the receiver of stolen goods shall undergo the same
punishment as the thief. the receiver of an exile shall be punished with
death. a man ought to have the same friends and enemies as his country;
and he who makes war or peace for himself shall be put to death. and if
a party in the state make war or peace, their leaders shall be indicted
by the generals, and, if convicted, they shall be put to death. the
ministers and officers of a country ought not to receive gifts, even as
the reward of good deeds. he who disobeys shall die.

with a view to taxation a man should have his property and income
valued: and the government may, at their discretion, levy the tax upon
the annual return, or take a portion of the whole.

the good man will offer moderate gifts to the gods; his land or hearth
cannot be offered, because they are already consecrated to all gods.
gold and silver, which arouse envy, and ivory, which is taken from the
dead body of an animal, are unsuitable offerings; iron and brass are
materials of war. wood and stone of a single piece may be offered; also
woven work which has not occupied one woman more than a month in making.
white is a colour which is acceptable to the gods; figures of birds and
similar offerings are the best of gifts, but they must be such as the
painter can execute in a day.

next concerning lawsuits. judges, or rather arbiters, may be agreed
upon by the plaintiff and defendant; and if no decision is obtained from
them, their fellow-tribesmen shall judge. at this stage there shall be
an increase of the penalty: the defendant, if he be cast, shall pay a
fifth more than the damages claimed. if he further persist, and appeal
a second time, the case shall be heard before the select judges; and
he shall pay, if defeated, the penalty and half as much again. and the
pursuer, if on the first appeal he is defeated, shall pay one fifth
of the damages claimed by him; and if on the second, one half. other
matters relating to trials, such as the assignment of judges to courts,
the times of sitting, the number of judges, the modes of pleading
and procedure, as we have already said, may be determined by younger
legislators.

these are to be the rules of private courts. as regards public courts,
many states have excellent modes of procedure which may serve for
models; these, when duly tested by experience, should be ratified and
made permanent by us.

let the judge be accomplished in the laws. he should possess writings
about them, and make a study of them; for laws are the highest
instrument of mental improvement, and derive their name from mind (nous,
nomos). they afford a measure of all censure and praise, whether in
verse or prose, in conversation or in books, and are an antidote to the
vain disputes of men and their equally vain acquiescence in each other's
opinions. the just judge, who imbibes their spirit, makes the city and
himself to stand upright. he establishes justice for the good, and cures
the tempers of the bad, if they can be cured; but denounces death, which
is the only remedy, to the incurable, the threads of whose life cannot
be reversed.

when the suits of the year are completed, execution is to follow. the
court is to award to the plaintiff the property of the defendant, if he
is cast, reserving to him only his lot of land. if the plaintiff is
not satisfied within a month, the court shall put into his hands the
property of the defendant. if the defendant fails in payment to the
amount of a drachma, he shall lose the use and protection of the court;
or if he rebel against the authority of the court, he shall be brought
before the guardians of the law, and if found guilty he shall be put to
death.

man having been born, educated, having begotten and brought up children,
and gone to law, fulfils the debt of nature. the rites which are to be
celebrated after death in honour of the gods above and below shall be
determined by the interpreters. the dead shall be buried in uncultivated
places, where they will be out of the way and do least injury to the
living. for no one either in life or after death has any right to
deprive other men of the sustenance which mother earth provides for
them. no sepulchral mound is to be piled higher than five men can
raise it in five days, and the grave-stone shall not be larger than is
sufficient to contain an inscription of four heroic verses. the dead
are only to be exposed for three days, which is long enough to test the
reality of death. the legislator will instruct the people that the body
is a mere shadow or image, and that the soul, which is our true being,
is gone to give an account of herself before the gods below. when they
hear this, the good are full of hope, and the evil are terrified. it
is also said that not much can be done for any one after death. and
therefore while in life all man should be helped by their kindred to
pass their days justly and holily, that they may depart in peace. when
a man loses a son or a brother, he should consider that the beloved one
has gone away to fulfil his destiny in another place, and should not
waste money over his lifeless remains. let the law then order a moderate
funeral of five minae for the first class, of three for the second, of
two for the third, of one for the fourth. one of the guardians of the
law, to be selected by the relatives, shall assist them in arranging
the affairs of the deceased. there would be a want of delicacy in
prescribing that there should or should not be mourning for the dead.
but, at any rate, such mourning is to be confined to the house; there
must be no processions in the streets, and the dead body shall be taken
out of the city before daybreak. regulations about other forms of burial
and about the non-burial of parricides and other sacrilegious persons
have already been laid down. the work of legislation is therefore nearly
completed; its end will be finally accomplished when we have provided
for the continuance of the state.

do you remember the names of the fates? lachesis, the giver of the lots,
is the first of them; clotho, the spinster, the second; atropos, the
unchanging one, is the third and last, who makes the threads of the web
irreversible. and we too want to make our laws irreversible, for the
unchangeable quality in them will be the salvation of the state, and the
source of health and order in the bodies and souls of our citizens. 'but
can such a quality be implanted?' i think that it may; and at any rate
we must try; for, after all our labour, to have been piling up a fabric
which has no foundation would be too ridiculous. 'what foundation would
you lay?' we have already instituted an assembly which was composed
of the ten oldest guardians of the law, and secondly, of those who had
received prizes of virtue, and thirdly, of the travellers who had gone
abroad to enquire into the laws of other countries. moreover, each of
the members was to choose a young man, of not less than thirty years of
age, to be approved by the rest; and they were to meet at dawn, when all
the world is at leisure. this assembly will be an anchor to the vessel
of state, and provide the means of permanence; for the constitutions of
states, like all other things, have their proper saviours, which are to
them what the head and soul are to the living being. 'how do you mean?'
mind in the soul, and sight and hearing in the head, or rather, the
perfect union of mind and sense, may be justly called every man's
salvation. 'certainly.' yes; but of what nature is this union? in the
case of a ship, for example, the senses of the sailors are added to the
intelligence of the pilot, and the two together save the ship and
the men in the ship. again, the physician and the general have their
objects; and the object of the one is health, of the other victory.
states, too, have their objects, and the ruler must understand, first,
their nature, and secondly, the means of attaining them, whether in laws
or men. the state which is wanting in this knowledge cannot be
expected to be wise when the time for action arrives. now what class
or institution is there in our state which has such a saving power? 'i
suspect that you are referring to the nocturnal council.' yes, to that
council which is to have all virtue, and which should aim directly at
the mark. 'very true.' the inconsistency of legislation in most states
is not surprising, when the variety of their objects is considered. one
of them makes their rule of justice the government of a class; another
aims at wealth; another at freedom, or at freedom and power; and some
who call themselves philosophers maintain that you should seek for all
of them at once. but our object is unmistakeably virtue, and virtue is
of four kinds. 'yes; and we said that mind is the chief and ruler of the
three other kinds of virtue and of all else.' true, cleinias; and now,
having already declared the object which is present to the mind of the
pilot, the general, the physician, we will interrogate the mind of the
statesman. tell me, i say, as the physician and general have told us
their object, what is the object of the statesman. can you tell me? 'we
cannot.' did we not say that there are four virtues--courage, wisdom,
and two others, all of which are called by the common name of virtue,
and are in a sense one? 'certainly we did.' the difficulty is, not in
understanding the differences of the virtues, but in apprehending their
unity. why do we call virtue, which is a single thing, by the two names
of wisdom and courage? the reason is that courage is concerned with
fear, and is found both in children and in brutes; for the soul may
be courageous without reason, but no soul was, or ever will be, wise
without reason. 'that is true.' i have explained to you the difference,
and do you in return explain to me the unity. but first let us consider
whether any one who knows the name of a thing without the definition has
any real knowledge of it. is not such knowledge a disgrace to a man of
sense, especially where great and glorious truths are concerned? and can
any subject be more worthy of the attention of our legislators than the
four virtues of which we are speaking--courage, temperance, justice,
wisdom? ought not the magistrates and officers of the state to instruct
the citizens in the nature of virtue and vice, instead of leaving them
to be taught by some chance poet or sophist? a city which is without
instruction suffers the usual fate of cities in our day. what then shall
we do? how shall we perfect the ideas of our guardians about virtue? how
shall we give our state a head and eyes? 'yes, but how do you apply the
figure?' the city will be the body or trunk; the best of our young men
will mount into the head or acropolis and be our eyes; they will look
about them, and inform the elders, who are the mind and use the younger
men as their instruments: together they will save the state. shall this
be our constitution, or shall all be educated alike, and the special
training be given up? 'that is impossible.' let us then endeavour to
attain to some more exact idea of education. did we not say that the
true artist or guardian ought to have an eye, not only to the many, but
to the one, and to order all things with a view to the one? can there be
any more philosophical speculation than how to reduce many things which
are unlike to one idea? 'perhaps not.' say rather, 'certainly not.' and
the rulers of our divine state ought to have an exact knowledge of
the common principle in courage, temperance, justice, wisdom, which is
called by the name of virtue; and unless we know whether virtue is one
or many, we shall hardly know what virtue is. shall we contrive some
means of engrafting this knowledge on our state, or give the matter up?
'anything rather than that.' let us begin by making an agreement. 'by
all means, if we can.' well, are we not agreed that our guardians ought
to know, not only how the good and the honourable are many, but also how
they are one? 'yes, certainly.' the true guardian of the laws ought to
know their truth, and should also be able to interpret and execute them?
'he should.' and is there any higher knowledge than the knowledge of the
existence and power of the gods? the people may be excused for following
tradition; but the guardian must be able to give a reason of the faith
which is in him. and there are two great evidences of religion--the
priority of the soul and the order of the heavens. for no man of
sense, when he contemplates the universe, will be likely to substitute
necessity for reason and will. those who maintain that the sun and the
stars are inanimate beings are utterly wrong in their opinions. the
men of a former generation had a suspicion, which has been confirmed
by later thinkers, that things inanimate could never without mind have
attained such scientific accuracy; and some (anaxagoras) even in those
days ventured to assert that mind had ordered all things in heaven; but
they had no idea of the priority of mind, and they turned the world,
or more properly themselves, upside down, and filled the universe
with stones, and earth, and other inanimate bodies. this led to
great impiety, and the poets said many foolish things against the
philosophers, whom they compared to 'yelping she-dogs,' besides making
other abusive remarks. no man can now truly worship the gods who does
not believe that the soul is eternal, and prior to the body, and the
ruler of all bodies, and does not perceive also that there is mind
in the stars; or who has not heard the connexion of these things with
music, and has not harmonized them with manners and laws, giving a
reason of things which are matters of reason. he who is unable to
acquire this knowledge, as well as the ordinary virtues of a citizen,
can only be a servant, and not a ruler in the state.

let us then add another law to the effect that the nocturnal council
shall be a guard set for the salvation of the state. 'very good.' to
establish this will be our aim, and i hope that others besides myself
will assist. 'let us proceed along the road in which god seems to guide
us.' we cannot, megillus and cleinias, anticipate the details which will
hereafter be needed; they must be supplied by experience. 'what do you
mean?' first of all a register will have to be made of all those whose
age, character, or education would qualify them to be guardians. the
subjects which they are to learn, and the order in which they are to
be learnt, are mysteries which cannot be explained beforehand, but not
mysteries in any other sense. 'if that is the case, what is to be done?'
we must stake our all on a lucky throw, and i will share the risk by
stating my views on education. and i would have you, cleinias, who are
the founder of the magnesian state, and will obtain the greatest glory
if you succeed, and will at least be praised for your courage, if you
fail, take especial heed of this matter. if we can only establish the
nocturnal council, we will hand over the city to its keeping; none of
the present company will hesitate about that. our dream will then become
a reality; and our citizens, if they are carefully chosen and well
educated, will be saviours and guardians such as the world hitherto has
never seen.

the want of completeness in the laws becomes more apparent in the later
books. there is less arrangement in them, and the transitions are more
abrupt from one subject to another. yet they contain several noble
passages, such as the 'prelude to the discourse concerning the honour
and dishonour of parents,' or the picture of the dangers attending the
'friendly intercourse of young men and maidens with one another,' or the
soothing remonstrance which is addressed to the dying man respecting his
right to do what he will with his own, or the fine description of the
burial of the dead. the subject of religion in book x is introduced as
a prelude to offences against the gods, and this portion of the work
appears to be executed in plato's best manner.

in the last four books, several questions occur for consideration: among
them are (i) the detection and punishment of offences; (ii) the nature
of the voluntary and involuntary; (iii) the arguments against atheism,
and against the opinion that the gods have no care of human affairs;
(iv) the remarks upon retail trade; (v) the institution of the nocturnal
council.

i. a weak point in the laws of plato is the amount of inquisition into
private life which is to be made by the rulers. the magistrate is
always watching and waylaying the citizens. he is constantly to receive
information against improprieties of life. plato does not seem to be
aware that espionage can only have a negative effect. he has not yet
discovered the boundary line which parts the domain of law from that of
morality or social life. men will not tell of one another; nor will
he ever be the most honoured citizen, who gives the most frequent
information about offenders to the magistrates.

as in some writers of fiction, so also in philosophers, we may observe
the effect of age. plato becomes more conservative as he grows older,
and he would govern the world entirely by men like himself, who are
above fifty years of age; for in them he hopes to find a principle of
stability. he does not remark that, in destroying the freedom he is
destroying also the life of the state. in reducing all the citizens to
rule and measure, he would have been depriving the magnesian colony of
those great men 'whose acquaintance is beyond all price;' and he would
have found that in the worst-governed hellenic state, there was more of
a carriere ouverte for extraordinary genius and virtue than in his own.

plato has an evident dislike of the athenian dicasteries; he prefers a
few judges who take a leading part in the conduct of trials to a great
number who only listen in silence. he allows of two appeals--in each
case however with an increase of the penalty. modern jurists would
disapprove of the redress of injustice being purchased only at an
increasing risk; though indirectly the burden of legal expenses, which
seems to have been little felt among the athenians, has a similar
effect. the love of litigation, which is a remnant of barbarism quite
as much as a corruption of civilization, and was innate in the athenian
people, is diminished in the new state by the imposition of severe
penalties. if persevered in, it is to be punished with death.

in the laws murder and homicide besides being crimes, are also
pollutions. regarded from this point of view, the estimate of such
offences is apt to depend on accidental circumstances, such as the
shedding of blood, and not on the real guilt of the offender or the
injury done to society. they are measured by the horror which they
arouse in a barbarous age. for there is a superstition in law as well as
in religion, and the feelings of a primitive age have a traditional hold
on the mass of the people. on the other hand, plato is innocent of the
barbarity which would visit the sins of the fathers upon the children,
and he is quite aware that punishment has an eye to the future, and not
to the past. compared with that of most european nations in the last
century his penal code, though sometimes capricious, is reasonable and
humane.

a defect in plato's criminal jurisprudence is his remission of the
punishment when the homicide has obtained the forgiveness of the
murdered person; as if crime were a personal affair between
individuals, and not an offence against the state. there is a ridiculous
disproportion in his punishments. because a slave may fairly receive
a blow for stealing one fig or one bunch of grapes, or a tradesman for
selling adulterated goods to the value of one drachma, it is rather
hard upon the slave that he should receive as many blows as he has taken
grapes or figs, or upon the tradesman who has sold adulterated goods
to the value of a thousand drachmas that he should receive a thousand
blows.

ii. but before punishment can be inflicted at all, the legislator
must determine the nature of the voluntary and involuntary. the great
question of the freedom of the will, which in modern times has been worn
threadbare with purely abstract discussion, was approached both by plato
and aristotle--first, from the judicial; secondly, from the sophistical
point of view. they were puzzled by the degrees and kinds of crime; they
observed also that the law only punished hurts which are inflicted by a
voluntary agent on an involuntary patient.

in attempting to distinguish between hurt and injury, plato says that
mere hurt is not injury; but that a benefit when done in a wrong spirit
may sometimes injure, e.g. when conferred without regard to right and
wrong, or to the good or evil consequences which may follow. he means
to say that the good or evil disposition of the agent is the principle
which characterizes actions; and this is not sufficiently described by
the terms voluntary and involuntary. you may hurt another involuntarily,
and no one would suppose that you had injured him; and you may hurt him
voluntarily, as in inflicting punishment--neither is this injury; but if
you hurt him from motives of avarice, ambition, or cowardly fear, this
is injury. injustice is also described as the victory of desire or
passion or self-conceit over reason, as justice is the subordination of
them to reason. in some paradoxical sense plato is disposed to affirm
all injustice to be involuntary; because no man would do injustice who
knew that it never paid and could calculate the consequences of what
he was doing. yet, on the other hand, he admits that the distinction of
voluntary and involuntary, taken in another and more obvious sense, is
the basis of legislation. his conception of justice and injustice is
complicated (1) by the want of a distinction between justice and virtue,
that is to say, between the quality which primarily regards others, and
the quality in which self and others are equally regarded; (2) by the
confusion of doing and suffering justice; (3) by the unwillingness to
renounce the old socratic paradox, that evil is involuntary.

iii. the laws rest on a religious foundation; in this respect they
bear the stamp of primitive legislation. they do not escape the almost
inevitable consequence of making irreligion penal. if laws are based
upon religion, the greatest offence against them must be irreligion.
hence the necessity for what in modern language, and according to a
distinction which plato would scarcely have understood, might be termed
persecution. but the spirit of persecution in plato, unlike that of
modern religious bodies, arises out of the desire to enforce a true and
simple form of religion, and is directed against the superstitions which
tend to degrade mankind. sir thomas more, in his utopia, is in favour
of tolerating all except the intolerant, though he would not promote to
high offices those who disbelieved in the immortality of the soul. plato
has not advanced quite so far as this in the path of toleration. but
in judging of his enlightenment, we must remember that the evils of
necromancy and divination were far greater than those of intolerance in
the ancient world. human nature is always having recourse to the first;
but only when organized into some form of priesthood falls into the
other; although in primitive as in later ages the institution of a
priesthood may claim probably to be an advance on some form of religion
which preceded. the laws would have rested on a sounder foundation, if
plato had ever distinctly realized to his mind the difference between
crime and sin or vice. of this, as of many other controversies, a clear
definition might have been the end. but such a definition belongs to a
later age of philosophy.

the arguments which plato uses for the being of a god, have an extremely
modern character: first, the consensus gentium; secondly, the argument
which has already been adduced in the phaedrus, of the priority of the
self-moved. the answer to those who say that god 'cares not,' is, that
he governs by general laws; and that he who takes care of the great
will assuredly take care of the small. plato did not feel, and has not
attempted to consider, the difficulty of reconciling the special with
the general providence of god. yet he is on the road to a solution, when
he regards the world as a whole, of which all the parts work together
towards the final end.

we are surprised to find that the scepticism, which we attribute to
young men in our own day, existed then (compare republic); that the
epicureanism expressed in the line of horace (borrowed from lucretius)--

'namque deos didici securum agere aevum,'

was already prevalent in the age of plato; and that the terrors of
another world were freely used in order to gain advantages over other
men in this. the same objection which struck the psalmist--'when i saw
the prosperity of the wicked'--is supposed to lie at the root of the
better sort of unbelief. and the answer is substantially the same which
the modern theologian would offer:--that the ways of god in this world
cannot be justified unless there be a future state of rewards and
punishments. yet this future state of rewards and punishments is in
plato's view not any addition of happiness or suffering imposed from
without, but the permanence of good and evil in the soul: here he is in
advance of many modern theologians. the greek, too, had his difficulty
about the existence of evil, which in one solitary passage, remarkable
for being inconsistent with his general system, plato explains,
after the magian fashion, by a good and evil spirit (compare theaet.,
statesman). this passage is also remarkable for being at variance with
the general optimism of the tenth book--not 'all things are ordered by
god for the best,' but some things by a good, others by an evil spirit.

the tenth book of the laws presents a picture of the state of belief
among the greeks singularly like that of the world in which we live.
plato is disposed to attribute the incredulity of his own age to several
causes. first, to the bad effect of mythological tales, of which he
retains his disapproval; but he has a weak side for antiquity, and is
unwilling, as in the republic, wholly to proscribe them. secondly, he
remarks the self-conceit of a newly-fledged generation of philosophers,
who declare that the sun, moon, and stars, are earth and stones only;
and who also maintain that the gods are made by the laws of the state.
thirdly, he notes a confusion in the minds of men arising out of their
misinterpretation of the appearances of the world around them: they do
not always see the righteous rewarded and the wicked punished. so in
modern times there are some whose infidelity has arisen from doubts
about the inspiration of ancient writings; others who have been made
unbelievers by physical science, or again by the seemingly political
character of religion; while there is a third class to whose minds the
difficulty of 'justifying the ways of god to man' has been the chief
stumblingblock. plato is very much out of temper at the impiety of some
of his contemporaries; yet he is determined to reason with the victims,
as he regards them, of these illusions before he punishes them. his
answer to the unbelievers is twofold: first, that the soul is prior to
the body; secondly, that the ruler of the universe being perfect has
made all things with a view to their perfection. the difficulties
arising out of ancient sacred writings were far less serious in the age
of plato than in our own.

we too have our popular epicureanism, which would allow the world to go
on as if there were no god. when the belief in him, whether of ancient
or modern times, begins to fade away, men relegate him, either in theory
or practice, into a distant heaven. they do not like expressly to deny
god when it is more convenient to forget him; and so the theory of the
epicurean becomes the practice of mankind in general. nor can we be
said to be free from that which plato justly considers to be the worst
unbelief--of those who put superstition in the place of true religion.
for the larger half of christians continue to assert that the justice of
god may be turned aside by gifts, and, if not by the 'odour of fat, and
the sacrifice steaming to heaven,' still by another kind of
sacrifice placed upon the altar--by masses for the quick and dead, by
dispensations, by building churches, by rites and ceremonies--by the
same means which the heathen used, taking other names and shapes. and
the indifference of epicureanism and unbelief is in two ways the parent
of superstition, partly because it permits, and also because it
creates, a necessity for its development in religious and enthusiastic
temperaments. if men cannot have a rational belief, they will have an
irrational. and hence the most superstitious countries are also at a
certain point of civilization the most unbelieving, and the revolution
which takes one direction is quickly followed by a reaction in the
other. so we may read 'between the lines' ancient history and philosophy
into modern, and modern into ancient. whether we compare the theory of
greek philosophy with the christian religion, or the practice of the
gentile world with the practice of the christian world, they will be
found to differ more in words and less in reality than we might have
supposed. the greater opposition which is sometimes made between them
seems to arise chiefly out of a comparison of the ideal of the one with
the practice of the other.

to the errors of superstition and unbelief plato opposes the simple and
natural truth of religion; the best and highest, whether conceived in
the form of a person or a principle--as the divine mind or as the idea
of good--is believed by him to be the basis of human life. that all
things are working together for good to the good and evil to the evil in
this or in some other world to which human actions are transferred, is
the sum of his faith or theology. unlike socrates, he is absolutely free
from superstition. religion and morality are one and indivisible to him.
he dislikes the 'heathen mythology,' which, as he significantly remarks,
was not tolerated in crete, and perhaps (for the meaning of his words
is not quite clear) at sparta. he gives no encouragement to individual
enthusiasm; 'the establishment of religion could only be the work of a
mighty intellect.' like the hebrews, he prohibits private rites; for the
avoidance of superstition, he would transfer all worship of the gods
to the public temples. he would not have men and women consecrating
the accidents of their lives. he trusts to human punishments and not to
divine judgments; though he is not unwilling to repeat the old tradition
that certain kinds of dishonesty 'prevent a man from having a family.'
he considers that the 'ages of faith' have passed away and cannot now
be recalled. yet he is far from wishing to extirpate the sentiment of
religion, which he sees to be common to all mankind--barbarians as well
as hellenes. he remarks that no one passes through life without, sooner
or later, experiencing its power. to which we may add the further remark
that the greater the irreligion, the more violent has often been the
religious reaction.

it is remarkable that plato's account of mind at the end of the laws
goes beyond anaxagoras, and beyond himself in any of his previous
writings. aristotle, in a well-known passage (met.) which is an echo of
the phaedo, remarks on the inconsistency of anaxagoras in introducing
the agency of mind, and yet having recourse to other and inferior,
probably material causes. but plato makes the further criticism, that
the error of anaxagoras consisted, not in denying the universal agency
of mind, but in denying the priority, or, as we should say, the eternity
of it. yet in the timaeus he had himself allowed that god made the world
out of pre-existing materials: in the statesman he says that there were
seeds of evil in the world arising out of the remains of a former chaos
which could not be got rid of; and even in the tenth book of the laws he
has admitted that there are two souls, a good and evil. in the meno, the
phaedrus, and the phaedo, he had spoken of the recovery of ideas from a
former state of existence. but now he has attained to a clearer point of
view: he has discarded these fancies. from meditating on the priority of
the human soul to the body, he has learnt the nature of soul absolutely.
the power of the best, of which he gave an intimation in the phaedo
and in the republic, now, as in the philebus, takes the form of an
intelligence or person. he no longer, like anaxagoras, supposes mind to
be introduced at a certain time into the world and to give order to
a pre-existing chaos, but to be prior to the chaos, everlasting and
evermoving, and the source of order and intelligence in all things. this
appears to be the last form of plato's religious philosophy, which might
almost be summed up in the words of kant, 'the starry heaven above and
the moral law within.' or rather, perhaps, 'the starry heaven above and
mind prior to the world.'

iv. the remarks about retail trade, about adulteration, and about
mendicity, have a very modern character. greek social life was more
like our own than we are apt to suppose. there was the same division
of ranks, the same aristocratic and democratic feeling, and, even in a
democracy, the same preference for land and for agricultural pursuits.
plato may be claimed as the first free trader, when he prohibits the
imposition of customs on imports and exports, though he was clearly
not aware of the importance of the principle which he enunciated. the
discredit of retail trade he attributes to the rogueries of traders,
and is inclined to believe that if a nobleman would keep a shop, which
heaven forbid! retail trade might become honourable. he has hardly
lighted upon the true reason, which appears to be the essential
distinction between buyers and sellers, the one class being necessarily
in some degree dependent on the other. when he proposes to fix prices
'which would allow a moderate gain,' and to regulate trade in several
minute particulars, we must remember that this is by no means so absurd
in a city consisting of 5040 citizens, in which almost every one would
know and become known to everybody else, as in our own vast population.
among ourselves we are very far from allowing every man to charge what
he pleases. of many things the prices are fixed by law. do we not often
hear of wages being adjusted in proportion to the profits of employers?
the objection to regulating them by law and thus avoiding the conflicts
which continually arise between the buyers and sellers of labour, is not
so much the undesirableness as the impossibility of doing so. wherever
free competition is not reconcileable either with the order of society,
or, as in the case of adulteration, with common honesty, the government
may lawfully interfere. the only question is,--whether the interference
will be effectual, and whether the evil of interference may not be
greater than the evil which is prevented by it.

he would prohibit beggars, because in a well-ordered state no good man
would be left to starve. this again is a prohibition which might have
been easily enforced, for there is no difficulty in maintaining the
poor when the population is small. in our own times the difficulty of
pauperism is rendered far greater, (1) by the enormous numbers, (2) by
the facility of locomotion, (3) by the increasing tenderness for human
life and suffering. and the only way of meeting the difficulty seems
to be by modern nations subdividing themselves into small bodies having
local knowledge and acting together in the spirit of ancient communities
(compare arist. pol.)

v. regarded as the framework of a polity the laws are deemed by plato to
be a decline from the republic, which is the dream of his earlier years.
he nowhere imagines that he has reached a higher point of speculation.
he is only descending to the level of human things, and he often returns
to his original idea. for the guardians of the republic, who were
the elder citizens, and were all supposed to be philosophers, is now
substituted a special body, who are to review and amend the laws,
preserving the spirit of the legislator. these are the nocturnal
council, who, although they are not specially trained in dialectic,
are not wholly destitute of it; for they must know the relation of
particular virtues to the general principle of virtue. plato has been
arguing throughout the laws that temperance is higher than courage,
peace than war, that the love of both must enter into the character of
the good citizen. and at the end the same thought is summed up by him in
an abstract form. the true artist or guardian must be able to reduce the
many to the one, than which, as he says with an enthusiasm worthy of the
phaedrus or philebus, 'no more philosophical method was ever devised
by the wit of man.' but the sense of unity in difference can only be
acquired by study; and plato does not explain to us the nature of this
study, which we may reasonably infer, though there is a remarkable
omission of the word, to be akin to the dialectic of the republic.

the nocturnal council is to consist of the priests who have obtained the
rewards of virtue, of the ten eldest guardians of the law, and of the
director and ex-directors of education; each of whom is to select for
approval a younger coadjutor. to this council the 'spectator,' who is
sent to visit foreign countries, has to make his report. it is not
an administrative body, but an assembly of sages who are to make
legislation their study. plato is not altogether disinclined to changes
in the law where experience shows them to be necessary; but he is also
anxious that the original spirit of the constitution should never be
lost sight of.

the laws of plato contain the latest phase of his philosophy, showing in
many respects an advance, and in others a decline, in his views of life
and the world. his theory of ideas in the next generation passed
into one of numbers, the nature of which we gather chiefly from the
metaphysics of aristotle. of the speculative side of this theory there
are no traces in the laws, but doubtless plato found the practical value
which he attributed to arithmetic greatly confirmed by the possibility
of applying number and measure to the revolution of the heavens, and
to the regulation of human life. in the return to a doctrine of numbers
there is a retrogression rather than an advance; for the most barren
logical abstraction is of a higher nature than number and figure.
philosophy fades away into the distance; in the laws it is confined to
the members of the nocturnal council. the speculative truth which was
the food of the guardians in the republic, is for the majority of the
citizens to be superseded by practical virtues. the law, which is the
expression of mind written down, takes the place of the living word of
the philosopher. (compare the contrast of phaedrus, and laws; also the
plays on the words nous, nomos, nou dianome; and the discussion in the
statesman of the difference between the personal rule of a king and
the impersonal reign of law.) the state is based on virtue and religion
rather than on knowledge; and virtue is no longer identified with
knowledge, being of the commoner sort, and spoken of in the sense
generally understood. yet there are many traces of advance as well as
retrogression in the laws of plato. the attempt to reconcile the ideal
with actual life is an advance; to 'have brought philosophy down from
heaven to earth,' is a praise which may be claimed for him as well as
for his master socrates. and the members of the nocturnal council are
to continue students of the 'one in many' and of the nature of god.
education is the last word with which plato supposes the theory of the
laws to end and the reality to begin.

plato's increasing appreciation of the difficulties of human affairs,
and of the element of chance which so largely influences them, is an
indication not of a narrower, but of a maturer mind, which had become
more conversant with realities. nor can we fairly attribute any want of
originality to him, because he has borrowed many of his provisions from
sparta and athens. laws and institutions grow out of habits and customs;
and they have 'better opinion, better confirmation,' if they have come
down from antiquity and are not mere literary inventions. plato would
have been the first to acknowledge that the book of laws was not the
creation of his fancy, but a collection of enactments which had been
devised by inspired legislators, like minos, lycurgus, and solon,
to meet the actual needs of men, and had been approved by time and
experience.

in order to do justice therefore to the design of the work, it is
necessary to examine how far it rests on an historical foundation and
coincides with the actual laws of sparta and athens. the consideration
of the historical aspect of the laws has been reserved for this place.
in working out the comparison the writer has been greatly assisted
by the excellent essays of c.f. hermann ('de vestigiis institutorum
veterum, imprimis atticorum, per platonis de legibus libros indagandis,'
and 'juris domestici et familiaris apud platonem in legibus cum veteris
graeciae inque primis athenarum institutis comparatio': marburg, 1836),
and by j.b. telfy's 'corpus juris attici' (leipzig, 1868).




excursus on the relation of the laws of plato to the institutions of
crete and lacedaemon and to the laws and constitution of athens.

the laws of plato are essentially greek: unlike xenophon's cyropaedia,
they contain nothing foreign or oriental. their aim is to reconstruct
the work of the great lawgivers of hellas in a literary form. they
partake both of an athenian and a spartan character. some of them too
are derived from crete, and are appropriately transferred to a cretan
colony. but of crete so little is known to us, that although, as
montesquieu (esprit des lois) remarks, 'the laws of crete are the
original of those of sparta and the laws of plato the correction of
these latter,' there is only one point, viz. the common meals, in which
they can be compared. most of plato's provisions resemble the laws and
customs which prevailed in these three states (especially in the two
former), and which the personifying instinct of the greeks attributed
to minos, lycurgus, and solon. a very few particulars may have been
borrowed from zaleucus (cic. de legibus), and charondas, who is said to
have first made laws against perjury (arist. pol.) and to have forbidden
credit (stob. florileg., gaisford). some enactments are plato's own, and
were suggested by his experience of defects in the athenian and other
greek states. the laws also contain many lesser provisions, which are
not found in the ordinary codes of nations, because they cannot be
properly defined, and are therefore better left to custom and common
sense. 'the greater part of the work,' as aristotle remarks (pol.), 'is
taken up with laws': yet this is not wholly true, and applies to the
latter rather than to the first half of it. the book rests on an ethical
and religious foundation: the actual laws begin with a hymn of praise
in honour of the soul. and the same lofty aspiration after the good
is perpetually recurring, especially in books x, xi, xii, and whenever
plato's mind is filled with his highest themes. in prefixing to most of
his laws a prooemium he has two ends in view, to persuade and also
to threaten. they are to have the sanction of laws and the effect of
sermons. and plato's 'book of laws,' if described in the language of
modern philosophy, may be said to be as much an ethical and educational,
as a political or legal treatise.

but although the laws partake both of an athenian and a spartan
character, the elements which are borrowed from either state are
necessarily very different, because the character and origin of the two
governments themselves differed so widely. sparta was the more ancient
and primitive: athens was suited to the wants of a later stage of
society. the relation of the two states to the laws may be conceived
in this manner:--the foundation and ground-plan of the work are more
spartan, while the superstructure and details are more athenian. at
athens the laws were written down and were voluminous; more than a
thousand fragments of them have been collected by telfy. like the roman
or english law, they contained innumerable particulars. those of them
which regulated daily life were familiarly known to the athenians; for
every citizen was his own lawyer, and also a judge, who decided the
rights of his fellow-citizens according to the laws, often after hearing
speeches from the parties interested or from their advocates. it is to
rome and not to athens that the invention of law, in the modern sense
of the term, is commonly ascribed. but it must be remembered that long
before the times of the twelve tables (b.c. 451), regular courts and
forms of law had existed at athens and probably in the greek colonies.
and we may reasonably suppose, though without any express proof of the
fact, that many roman institutions and customs, like latin literature
and mythology, were partly derived from hellas and had imperceptibly
drifted from one shore of the ionian sea to the other (compare
especially the constitutions of servius tullius and of solon).

it is not proved that the laws of sparta were in ancient times either
written down in books or engraved on tablets of marble or brass. nor is
it certain that, if they had been, the spartans could have read
them. they were ancient customs, some of them older probably than the
settlement in laconia, of which the origin is unknown; they occasionally
received the sanction of the delphic oracle, but there was a still
stronger obligation by which they were enforced,--the necessity of
self-defence: the spartans were always living in the presence of their
enemies. they belonged to an age when written law had not yet taken
the place of custom and tradition. the old constitution was very rarely
affected by new enactments, and these only related to the duties of the
kings or ephors, or the new relations of classes which arose as
time went on. hence there was as great a difference as could well
be conceived between the laws of athens and sparta: the one was the
creation of a civilized state, and did not differ in principle from our
modern legislation, the other of an age in which the people were held
together and also kept down by force of arms, and which afterwards
retained many traces of its barbaric origin 'surviving in culture.'

nevertheless the lacedaemonian was the ideal of a primitive greek state.
according to thucydides it was the first which emerged out of confusion
and became a regular government. it was also an army devoted to
military exercises, but organized with a view to self-defence and not
to conquest. it was not quick to move or easily excited; but stolid,
cautious, unambitious, procrastinating. for many centuries it retained
the same character which was impressed upon it by the hand of the
legislator. this singular fabric was partly the result of circumstances,
partly the invention of some unknown individual in prehistoric times,
whose ideal of education was military discipline, and who, by the
ascendency of his genius, made a small tribe into a nation which became
famous in the world's history. the other hellenes wondered at the
strength and stability of his work. the rest of hellas, says thucydides,
undertook the colonisation of heraclea the more readily, having a
feeling of security now that they saw the lacedaemonians taking part in
it. the spartan state appears to us in the dawn of history as a vision
of armed men, irresistible by any other power then existing in the
world. it can hardly be said to have understood at all the rights
or duties of nations to one another, or indeed to have had any moral
principle except patriotism and obedience to commanders. men were so
trained to act together that they lost the freedom and spontaneity of
human life in cultivating the qualities of the soldier and ruler. the
spartan state was a composite body in which kings, nobles, citizens,
perioeci, artisans, slaves, had to find a 'modus vivendi' with one
another. all of them were taught some use of arms. the strength of the
family tie was diminished among them by an enforced absence from
home and by common meals. sparta had no life or growth; no poetry or
tradition of the past; no art, no thought. the athenians started on
their great career some centuries later, but the spartans would have
been easily conquered by them, if athens had not been deficient in the
qualities which constituted the strength (and also the weakness) of her
rival.

the ideal of athens has been pictured for all time in the speech which
thucydides puts into the mouth of pericles, called the funeral oration.
he contrasts the activity and freedom and pleasantness of athenian
life with the immobility and severe looks and incessant drill of the
spartans. the citizens of no city were more versatile, or more readily
changed from land to sea or more quickly moved about from place to
place. they 'took their pleasures' merrily, and yet, when the time for
fighting arrived, were not a whit behind the spartans, who were like men
living in a camp, and, though always keeping guard, were often too late
for the fray. any foreigner might visit athens; her ships found a way
to the most distant shores; the riches of the whole earth poured in upon
her. her citizens had their theatres and festivals; they 'provided their
souls with many relaxations'; yet they were not less manly than the
spartans or less willing to sacrifice this enjoyable existence for their
country's good. the athenian was a nobler form of life than that of
their rivals, a life of music as well as of gymnastic, the life of a
citizen as well as of a soldier. such is the picture which thucydides
has drawn of the athenians in their glory. it is the spirit of this life
which plato would infuse into the magnesian state and which he seeks to
combine with the common meals and gymnastic discipline of sparta.

the two great types of athens and sparta had deeply entered into his
mind. he had heard of sparta at a distance and from common hellenic
fame: he was a citizen of athens and an athenian of noble birth. he must
often have sat in the law-courts, and may have had personal experience
of the duties of offices such as he is establishing. there is no need to
ask the question, whence he derived his knowledge of the laws of
athens: they were a part of his daily life. many of his enactments
are recognized to be athenian laws from the fragments preserved in
the orators and elsewhere: many more would be found to be so if we had
better information. probably also still more of them would have been
incorporated in the magnesian code, if the work had ever been finally
completed. but it seems to have come down to us in a form which is
partly finished and partly unfinished, having a beginning and end,
but wanting arrangement in the middle. the laws answer to plato's own
description of them, in the comparison which he makes of himself and his
two friends to gatherers of stones or the beginners of some
composite work, 'who are providing materials and partly putting them
together:--having some of their laws, like stones, already fixed in
their places, while others lie about.'

plato's own life coincided with the period at which athens rose to her
greatest heights and sank to her lowest depths. it was impossible that
he should regard the blessings of democracy in the same light as the
men of a former generation, whose view was not intercepted by the evil
shadow of the taking of athens, and who had only the glories of marathon
and salamis and the administration of pericles to look back upon. on the
other hand the fame and prestige of sparta, which had outlived so many
crimes and blunders, was not altogether lost at the end of the life
of plato. hers was the only great hellenic government which preserved
something of its ancient form; and although the spartan citizens were
reduced to almost one-tenth of their original number (arist. pol.),
she still retained, until the rise of thebes and macedon, a certain
authority and predominance due to her final success in the struggle with
athens and to the victories which agesilaus won in asia minor.

plato, like aristotle, had in his mind some form of a mean state which
should escape the evils and secure the advantages of both aristocracy
and democracy. it may however be doubted whether the creation of such
a state is not beyond the legislator's art, although there have been
examples in history of forms of government, which through some community
of interest or of origin, through a balance of parties in the state
itself, or through the fear of a common enemy, have for a while
preserved such a character of moderation. but in general there arises a
time in the history of a state when the struggle between the few and
the many has to be fought out. no system of checks and balances, such as
plato has devised in the laws, could have given equipoise and stability
to an ancient state, any more than the skill of the legislator could
have withstood the tide of democracy in england or france during the
last hundred years, or have given life to china or india.

the basis of the magnesian constitution is the equal division of land.
in the new state, as in the republic, there was to be neither poverty
nor riches. every citizen under all circumstances retained his lot, and
as much money as was necessary for the cultivation of it, and no one was
allowed to accumulate property to the amount of more than five times
the value of the lot, inclusive of it. the equal division of land was a
spartan institution, not known to have existed elsewhere in hellas. the
mention of it in the laws of plato affords considerable presumption that
it was of ancient origin, and not first introduced, as mr. grote and
others have imagined, in the reformation of cleomenes iii. but at
sparta, if we may judge from the frequent complaints of the accumulation
of property in the hands of a few persons (arist. pol.), no provision
could have been made for the maintenance of the lot. plutarch indeed
speaks of a law introduced by the ephor epitadeus soon after the
peloponnesian war, which first allowed the spartans to sell their land
(agis): but from the manner in which aristotle refers to the subject,
we should imagine this evil in the state to be of a much older standing.
like some other countries in which small proprietors have been numerous,
the original equality passed into inequality, and, instead of a large
middle class, there was probably at sparta greater disproportion in the
property of the citizens than in any other state of hellas. plato was
aware of the danger, and has improved on the spartan custom. the land,
as at sparta, must have been tilled by slaves, since other occupations
were found for the citizens. bodies of young men between the ages of
twenty-five and thirty were engaged in making biennial peregrinations of
the country. they and their officers are to be the magistrates, police,
engineers, aediles, of the twelve districts into which the colony was
divided. their way of life may be compared with that of the spartan
secret police or crypteia, a name which plato freely applies to them
without apparently any consciousness of the odium which has attached to
the word in history.

another great institution which plato borrowed from sparta (or crete) is
the syssitia or common meals. these were established in both states, and
in some respects were considered by aristotle to be better managed in
crete than at lacedaemon (pol.). in the laws the cretan custom appears
to be adopted (this is not proved, as hermann supposes ('de vestigiis,'
etc.)): that is to say, if we may interpret plato by aristotle, the cost
of them was defrayed by the state and not by the individuals (arist.
pol); so that the members of the mess, who could not pay their quota,
still retained their rights of citizenship. but this explanation is
hardly consistent with the laws, where contributions to the syssitia
from private estates are expressly mentioned. plato goes further than
the legislators of sparta and crete, and would extend the common meals
to women as well as men: he desires to curb the disorders, which existed
among the female sex in both states, by the application to women of the
same military discipline to which the men were already subject. it
was an extension of the custom of syssitia from which the ancient
legislators shrank, and which plato himself believed to be very
difficult of enforcement.

like sparta, the new colony was not to be surrounded by walls,--a state
should learn to depend upon the bravery of its citizens only--a fallacy
or paradox, if it is not to be regarded as a poetical fancy, which is
fairly enough ridiculed by aristotle (pol.). women, too, must be ready
to assist in the defence of their country: they are not to rush to the
temples and altars, but to arm themselves with shield and spear. in the
regulation of the syssitia, in at least one of his enactments respecting
property, and in the attempt to correct the licence of women, plato
shows, that while he borrowed from the institutions of sparta and
favoured the spartan mode of life, he also sought to improve upon them.

the enmity to the sea is another spartan feature which is transferred
by plato to the magnesian state. he did not reflect that a non-maritime
power would always be at the mercy of one which had a command of the
great highway. their many island homes, the vast extent of coast which
had to be protected by them, their struggles first of all with the
phoenicians and carthaginians, and secondly with the persian fleets,
forced the greeks, mostly against their will, to devote themselves to
the sea. the islanders before the inhabitants of the continent, the
maritime cities before the inland, the corinthians and athenians before
the spartans, were compelled to fit out ships: last of all the spartans,
by the pressure of the peloponnesian war, were driven to establish a
naval force, which, after the battle of aegospotami, for more than
a generation commanded the aegean. plato, like the spartans, had a
prejudice against a navy, because he regarded it as the nursery of
democracy. but he either never considered, or did not care to explain,
how a city, set upon an island and 'distant not more than ten miles from
the sea, having a seaboard provided with excellent harbours,' could have
safely subsisted without one.

neither the spartans nor the magnesian colonists were permitted to
engage in trade or commerce. in order to limit their dealings as far
as possible to their own country, they had a separate coinage; the
magnesians were only allowed to use the common currency of hellas when
they travelled abroad, which they were forbidden to do unless they
received permission from the government. like the spartans, plato
was afraid of the evils which might be introduced into his state
by intercourse with foreigners; but he also shrinks from the utter
exclusiveness of sparta, and is not unwilling to allow visitors of a
suitable age and rank to come from other states to his own, as he also
allows citizens of his own state to go to foreign countries and bring
back a report of them. such international communication seemed to him
both honourable and useful.

we may now notice some points in which the commonwealth of the laws
approximates to the athenian model. these are much more numerous than
the previous class of resemblances; we are better able to compare the
laws of plato with those of athens, because a good deal more is known to
us of athens than of sparta.

the information which we possess about athenian law, though
comparatively fuller, is still fragmentary. the sources from which our
knowledge is derived are chiefly the following:--

(1) the orators,--antiphon, andocides, lysias, isocrates, demosthenes,
aeschines, lycurgus, and others.

(2) herodotus, thucydides, xenophon, plato, aristotle, as well as later
writers, such as cicero de legibus, plutarch, aelian, pausanias.

(3) lexicographers, such as harpocration, pollux, hesychius, suidas, and
the compiler of the etymologicum magnum, many of whom are of uncertain
date, and to a great extent based upon one another. their writings
extend altogether over more than eight hundred years, from the second to
the tenth century.

(4) the scholia on aristophanes, plato, demosthenes.

(5) a few inscriptions.

our knowledge of a subject derived from such various sources and for the
most part of uncertain date and origin, is necessarily precarious. no
critic can separate the actual laws of solon from those which passed
under his name in later ages. nor do the scholiasts and lexicographers
attempt to distinguish how many of these laws were still in force at the
time when they wrote, or when they fell into disuse and were to be found
in books only. nor can we hastily assume that enactments which occur
in the laws of plato were also a part of athenian law, however probable
this may appear.

there are two classes of similarities between plato's laws and those of
athens: (i) of institutions (ii) of minor enactments.

(i) the constitution of the laws in its general character resembles much
more nearly the athenian constitution of solon's time than that which
succeeded it, or the extreme democracy which prevailed in plato's own
day. it was a mean state which he hoped to create, equally unlike a
syracusan tyranny or the mob-government of the athenian assembly. there
are various expedients by which he sought to impart to it the quality of
moderation. (1) the whole people were to be educated: they could not be
all trained in philosophy, but they were to acquire the simple elements
of music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy; they were also to be subject
to military discipline, archontes kai archomenoi. (2) the majority of
them were, or had been at some time in their lives, magistrates, and had
the experience which is given by office. (3) the persons who held the
highest offices were to have a further education, not much inferior to
that provided for the guardians in the republic, though the range of
their studies is narrowed to the nature and divisions of virtue: here
their philosophy comes to an end. (4) the entire number of the citizens
(5040) rarely, if ever, assembled, except for purposes of elections. the
whole people were divided into four classes, each having the right to be
represented by the same number of members in the council. the result of
such an arrangement would be, as in the constitution of servius tullius,
to give a disproportionate share of power to the wealthier classes, who
may be supposed to be always much fewer in number than the poorer. this
tendency was qualified by the complicated system of selection by vote,
previous to the final election by lot, of which the object seems to be
to hand over to the wealthy few the power of selecting from the many
poor, and vice versa. (5) the most important body in the state was the
nocturnal council, which is borrowed from the areopagus at athens, as it
existed, or was supposed to have existed, in the days before ephialtes
and the eumenides of aeschylus, when its power was undiminished. in
some particulars plato appears to have copied exactly the customs and
procedure of the areopagus: both assemblies sat at night (telfy). there
was a resemblance also in more important matters. like the areopagus,
the nocturnal council was partly composed of magistrates and other
state officials, whose term of office had expired. (7) the constitution
included several diverse and even opposing elements, such as
the assembly and the nocturnal council. (8) there was much less
exclusiveness than at sparta; the citizens were to have an interest in
the government of neighbouring states, and to know what was going on in
the rest of the world.--all these were moderating influences.

a striking similarity between athens and the constitution of the
magnesian colony is the use of the lot in the election of judges
and other magistrates. that such a mode of election should have
been resorted to in any civilized state, or that it should have been
transferred by plato to an ideal or imaginary one, is very singular
to us. the most extreme democracy of modern times has never thought of
leaving government wholly to chance. it was natural that socrates
should scoff at it, and ask, 'who would choose a pilot or carpenter or
flute-player by lot' (xen. mem.)? yet there were many considerations
which made this mode of choice attractive both to the oligarch and to
the democrat:--(1) it seemed to recognize that one man was as good as
another, and that all the members of the governing body, whether few or
many, were on a perfect equality in every sense of the word. (2) to the
pious mind it appeared to be a choice made, not by man, but by heaven
(compare laws). (3) it afforded a protection against corruption and
intrigue...it must also be remembered that, although elected by lot,
the persons so elected were subject to a scrutiny before they entered
on their office, and were therefore liable, after election, if
disqualified, to be rejected (laws). they were, moreover, liable to be
called to account after the expiration of their office. in the election
of councillors plato introduces a further check: they are not to be
chosen directly by lot from all the citizens, but from a select body
previously elected by vote. in plato's state at least, as we may infer
from his silence on this point, judges and magistrates performed
their duties without pay, which was a guarantee both of their
disinterestedness and of their belonging probably to the higher class of
citizens (compare arist. pol.). hence we are not surprised that the use
of the lot prevailed, not only in the election of the athenian council,
but also in many oligarchies, and even in plato's colony. the
evil consequences of the lot are to a great extent avoided, if the
magistrates so elected do not, like the dicasts at athens, receive pay
from the state.

another parallel is that of the popular assembly, which at athens was
omnipotent, but in the laws has only a faded and secondary existence. in
plato it was chiefly an elective body, having apparently no judicial and
little political power entrusted to it. at athens it was the mainspring
of the democracy; it had the decision of war or peace, of life and
death; the acts of generals or statesmen were authorized or condemned
by it; no office or person was above its control. plato was far from
allowing such a despotic power to exist in his model community, and
therefore he minimizes the importance of the assembly and narrows its
functions. he probably never asked himself a question, which naturally
occurs to the modern reader, where was to be the central authority in
this new community, and by what supreme power would the differences of
inferior powers be decided. at the same time he magnifies and brings
into prominence the nocturnal council (which is in many respects a
reflection of the areopagus), but does not make it the governing body of
the state.

between the judicial system of the laws and that of athens there was
very great similarity, and a difference almost equally great. plato not
unfrequently adopts the details when he rejects the principle. at
athens any citizen might be a judge and member of the great court of
the heliaea. this was ordinarily subdivided into a number of inferior
courts, but an occasion is recorded on which the whole body, in
number six thousand, met in a single court (andoc. de myst.). plato
significantly remarks that a few judges, if they are good, are better
than a great number. he also, at least in capital cases, confines the
plaintiff and defendant to a single speech each, instead of allowing two
apiece, as was the common practice at athens. on the other hand, in all
private suits he gives two appeals, from the arbiters to the courts of
the tribes, and from the courts of the tribes to the final or supreme
court. there was nothing answering to this at athens. the three courts
were appointed in the following manner:--the arbiters were to be agreed
upon by the parties to the cause; the judges of the tribes to be elected
by lot; the highest tribunal to be chosen at the end of each year by the
great officers of state out of their own number--they were to serve for
a year, to undergo a scrutiny, and, unlike the athenian judges, to vote
openly. plato does not dwell upon methods of procedure: these are the
lesser matters which he leaves to the younger legislators. in cases of
murder and some other capital offences, the cause was to be tried by a
special tribunal, as was the custom at athens: military offences, too,
as at athens, were decided by the soldiers. public causes in the laws,
as sometimes at athens, were voted upon by the whole people: because, as
plato remarks, they are all equally concerned in them. they were to
be previously investigated by three of the principal magistrates. he
believes also that in private suits all should take part; 'for he who
has no share in the administration of justice is apt to imagine that he
has no share in the state at all.' the wardens of the country, like the
forty at athens, also exercised judicial power in small matters, as
well as the wardens of the agora and city. the department of justice is
better organized in plato than in an ordinary greek state, proceeding
more by regular methods, and being more restricted to distinct duties.

the executive of plato's laws, like the athenian, was different from
that of a modern civilized state. the difference chiefly consists in
this, that whereas among ourselves there are certain persons or classes
of persons set apart for the execution of the duties of government, in
ancient greece, as in all other communities in the earlier stages of
their development, they were not equally distinguished from the rest of
the citizens. the machinery of government was never so well organized as
in the best modern states. the judicial department was not so completely
separated from the legislative, nor the executive from the judicial, nor
the people at large from the professional soldier, lawyer, or priest. to
aristotle (pol.) it was a question requiring serious consideration--who
should execute a sentence? there was probably no body of police to whom
were entrusted the lives and properties of the citizens in any hellenic
state. hence it might be reasonably expected that every man should be
the watchman of every other, and in turn be watched by him. the ancients
do not seem to have remembered the homely adage that, 'what is every
man's business is no man's business,' or always to have thought of
applying the principle of a division of labour to the administration
of law and to government. every athenian was at some time or on some
occasion in his life a magistrate, judge, advocate, soldier, sailor,
policeman. he had not necessarily any private business; a good deal
of his time was taken up with the duties of office and other public
occupations. so, too, in plato's laws. a citizen was to interfere in a
quarrel, if older than the combatants, or to defend the outraged party,
if his junior. he was especially bound to come to the rescue of a parent
who was ill-treated by his children. he was also required to prosecute
the murderer of a kinsman. in certain cases he was allowed to arrest an
offender. he might even use violence to an abusive person. any
citizen who was not less than thirty years of age at times exercised
a magisterial authority, to be enforced even by blows. both in the
magnesian state and at athens many thousand persons must have shared
in the highest duties of government, if a section only of the council,
consisting of thirty or of fifty persons, as in the laws, or at
athens after the days of cleisthenes, held office for a month, or for
thirty-five days only. it was almost as if, in our own country, the
ministry or the houses of parliament were to change every month. the
average ability of the athenian and magnesian councillors could not have
been very high, considering there were so many of them. and yet they
were entrusted with the performance of the most important executive
duties. in these respects the constitution of the laws resembles athens
far more than sparta. all the citizens were to be, not merely soldiers,
but politicians and administrators.

(ii) there are numerous minor particulars in which the laws of plato
resemble those of athens. these are less interesting than the preceding,
but they show even more strikingly how closely in the composition of his
work plato has followed the laws and customs of his own country.

(1) evidence. (a) at athens a child was not allowed to give evidence
(telfy). plato has a similar law: 'a child shall be allowed to give
evidence only in cases of murder.' (b) at athens an unwilling witness
might be summoned; but he was not required to appear if he was ready
to declare on oath that he knew nothing about the matter in question
(telfy). so in the laws. (c) athenian law enacted that when more than
half the witnesses in a case had been convicted of perjury, there was to
be a new trial (anadikos krisis--telfy). there is a similar provision in
the laws. (d) false-witness was punished at athens by atimia and a fine
(telfy). plato is at once more lenient and more severe: 'if a man be
twice convicted of false-witness, he shall not be required, and if
thrice, he shall not be allowed to bear witness; and if he dare to
witness after he has been convicted three times,...he shall be punished
with death.'

(2) murder. (a) wilful murder was punished in athenian law by death,
perpetual exile, and confiscation of property (telfy). plato, too,
has the alternative of death or exile, but he does not confiscate the
murderer's property. (b) the parricide was not allowed to escape by
going into exile at athens (telfy), nor, apparently, in the laws. (c)
a homicide, if forgiven by his victim before death, received no
punishment, either at athens (telfy), or in the magnesian state. in both
(telfy) the contriver of a murder is punished as severely as the doer;
and persons accused of the crime are forbidden to enter temples or
the agora until they have been tried (telfy). (d) at athens slaves who
killed their masters and were caught red-handed, were not to be put to
death by the relations of the murdered man, but to be handed over to the
magistrates (telfy). so in the laws, the slave who is guilty of wilful
murder has a public execution: but if the murder is committed in anger,
it is punished by the kinsmen of the victim.

(3) involuntary homicide. (a) the guilty person, according to the
athenian law, had to go into exile, and might not return, until the
family of the man slain were conciliated. then he must be purified
(telfy). if he is caught before he has obtained forgiveness, he may be
put to death. these enactments reappear in the laws. (b) the curious
provision of plato, that a stranger who has been banished for
involuntary homicide and is subsequently wrecked upon the coast, must
'take up his abode on the sea-shore, wetting his feet in the sea, and
watching for an opportunity of sailing,' recalls the procedure of
the judicium phreatteum at athens, according to which an involuntary
homicide, who, having gone into exile, is accused of a wilful murder,
was tried at phreatto for this offence in a boat by magistrates on the
shore. (c) a still more singular law, occurring both in the athenian
and magnesian code, enacts that a stone or other inanimate object which
kills a man is to be tried, and cast over the border (telfy).

(4) justifiable or excusable homicide. plato and athenian law agree in
making homicide justifiable or excusable in the following cases:--(1) at
the games (telfy); (2) in war (telfy); (3) if the person slain was found
doing violence to a free woman (telfy); (4) if a doctor's patient dies;
(5) in the case of a robber (telfy); (6) in self-defence (telfy).

(5) impiety. death or expulsion was the athenian penalty for impiety
(telfy). in the laws it is punished in various cases by imprisonment for
five years, for life, and by death.

(6) sacrilege. robbery of temples at athens was punished by death,
refusal of burial in the land, and confiscation of property (telfy).
in the laws the citizen who is guilty of such a crime is to 'perish
ingloriously and be cast beyond the borders of the land,' but his
property is not confiscated.

(7) sorcery. the sorcerer at athens was to be executed (telfy): compare
laws, where it is enacted that the physician who poisons and the
professional sorcerer shall be punished with death.

(8) treason. both at athens and in the laws the penalty for treason was
death (telfy), and refusal of burial in the country (telfy).

(9) sheltering exiles. 'if a man receives an exile, he shall be punished
with death.' so, too, in athenian law (telfy.).

(10) wounding. athenian law compelled a man who had wounded another to
go into exile; if he returned, he was to be put to death (telfy). plato
only punishes the offence with death when children wound their parents
or one another, or a slave wounds his master.

(11) bribery. death was the punishment for taking a bribe, both
at athens (telfy) and in the laws; but athenian law offered an
alternative--the payment of a fine of ten times the amount of the bribe.

(12) theft. plato, like athenian law (telfy), punishes the theft of
public property by death; the theft of private property in both involves
a fine of double the value of the stolen goods (telfy).

(13) suicide. he 'who slays him who of all men, as they say, is his own
best friend,' is regarded in the same spirit by plato and by athenian
law. plato would have him 'buried ingloriously on the borders of the
twelve portions of the land, in such places as are uncultivated and
nameless,' and 'no column or inscription is to mark the place of his
interment.' athenian law enacted that the hand which did the deed should
be separated from the body and be buried apart (telfy).

(14) injury. in cases of wilful injury, athenian law compelled the
guilty person to pay double the damage; in cases of involuntary injury,
simple damages (telfy). plato enacts that if a man wounds another in
passion, and the wound is curable, he shall pay double the damage, if
incurable or disfiguring, fourfold damages. if, however, the wounding is
accidental, he shall simply pay for the harm done.

(15) treatment of parents. athenian law allowed any one to indict
another for neglect or illtreatment of parents (telfy). so plato bids
bystanders assist a father who is assaulted by his son, and allows any
one to give information against children who neglect their parents.

(16) execution of sentences. both plato and athenian law give to the
winner of a suit power to seize the goods of the loser, if he does not
pay within the appointed time (telfy). at athens the penalty was also
doubled (telfy); not so in plato. plato however punishes contempt of
court by death, which at athens seems only to have been visited with a
further fine (telfy).

(17) property. (a) both at athens and in the laws a man who has disputed
property in his possession must give the name of the person from whom he
received it (telfy); and any one searching for lost property must enter
a house naked (telfy), or, as plato says, 'naked, or wearing only a
short tunic and without a girdle. (b) athenian law, as well as plato,
did not allow a father to disinherit his son without good reason and the
consent of impartial persons (telfy). neither grants to the eldest
son any special claim on the paternal estate (telfy). in the law of
inheritance both prefer males to females (telfy). (c) plato and athenian
law enacted that a tree should be planted at a fair distance from a
neighbour's property (telfy), and that when a man could not get water,
his neighbour must supply him (telfy). both at athens and in plato there
is a law about bees, the former providing that a beehive must be set up
at not less a distance than 300 feet from a neighbour's (telfy), and the
latter forbidding the decoying of bees.

(18) orphans. a ward must proceed against a guardian whom he suspects
of fraud within five years of the expiration of the guardianship. this
provision is common to plato and to athenian law (telfy). further, the
latter enacted that the nearest male relation should marry or provide
a husband for an heiress (telfy),--a point in which plato follows it
closely.

(19) contracts. plato's law that 'when a man makes an agreement which he
does not fulfil, unless the agreement be of a nature which the law or
a vote of the assembly does not allow, or which he has made under the
influence of some unjust compulsion, or which he is prevented from
fulfilling against his will by some unexpected chance,--the other party
may go to law with him,' according to pollux (quoted in telfy's note)
prevailed also at athens.

(20) trade regulations. (a) lying was forbidden in the agora both by
plato and at athens (telfy). (b) athenian law allowed an action of
recovery against a man who sold an unsound slave as sound (telfy).
plato's enactment is more explicit: he allows only an unskilled person
(i.e. one who is not a trainer or physician) to take proceedings in such
a case. (c) plato diverges from athenian practice in the disapproval of
credit, and does not even allow the supply of goods on the deposit of
a percentage of their value (telfy). he enacts that 'when goods are
exchanged by buying and selling, a man shall deliver them and receive
the price of them at a fixed place in the agora, and have done with
the matter,' and that 'he who gives credit must be satisfied whether he
obtain his money or not, for in such exchanges he will not be protected
by law. (d) athenian law forbad an extortionate rate of interest
(telfy); plato allows interest in one case only--if a contractor does
not receive the price of his work within a year of the time agreed--and
at the rate of 200 per cent. per annum for every drachma a monthly
interest of an obol. (e) both at athens and in the laws sales were to be
registered (telfy), as well as births (telfy).

(21) sumptuary laws. extravagance at weddings (telfy), and at funerals
(telfy) was forbidden at athens and also in the magnesian state.

there remains the subject of family life, which in plato's laws
partakes both of an athenian and spartan character. under this head may
conveniently be included the condition of women and of slaves. to family
life may be added citizenship.

as at sparta, marriages are to be contracted for the good of the state;
and they may be dissolved on the same ground, where there is a failure
of issue,--the interest of the state requiring that every one of the
5040 lots should have an heir. divorces are likewise permitted by plato
where there is an incompatibility of temper, as at athens by mutual
consent. the duty of having children is also enforced by a still higher
motive, expressed by plato in the noble words:--'a man should cling to
immortality, and leave behind him children's children to be the servants
of god in his place.' again, as at athens, the father is allowed to put
away his undutiful son, but only with the consent of impartial persons
(telfy), and the only suit which may be brought by a son against a
father is for imbecility. the class of elder and younger men and women
are still to regard one another, as in the republic, as standing in the
relation of parents and children. this is a trait of spartan character
rather than of athenian. a peculiar sanctity and tenderness was to be
shown towards the aged; the parent or grandparent stricken with years
was to be loved and worshipped like the image of a god, and was to be
deemed far more able than any lifeless statue to bring good or ill
to his descendants. great care is to be taken of orphans: they are
entrusted to the fifteen eldest guardians of the law, who are to be
'lawgivers and fathers to them not inferior to their natural fathers,'
as at athens they were entrusted to the archons. plato wishes to make
the misfortune of orphanhood as little sad to them as possible.

plato, seeing the disorder into which half the human race had fallen at
athens and sparta, is minded to frame for them a new rule of life. he
renounces his fanciful theory of communism, but still desires to place
women as far as possible on an equality with men. they were to be
trained in the use of arms, they are to live in public. their time was
partly taken up with gymnastic exercises; there could have been little
family or private life among them. their lot was to be neither like that
of spartan women, who were made hard and common by excessive practice
of gymnastic and the want of all other education,--nor yet like that of
athenian women, who, at least among the upper classes, retired into a
sort of oriental seclusion,--but something better than either. they were
to be the perfect mothers of perfect children, yet not wholly taken up
with the duties of motherhood, which were to be made easy to them as far
as possible (compare republic), but able to share in the perils of war
and to be the companions of their husbands. here, more than anywhere
else, the spirit of the laws reverts to the republic. in speaking of
them as the companions of their husbands we must remember that it is an
athenian and not a spartan way of life which they are invited to share,
a life of gaiety and brightness, not of austerity and abstinence, which
often by a reaction degenerated into licence and grossness.

in plato's age the subject of slavery greatly interested the minds of
thoughtful men; and how best to manage this 'troublesome piece of goods'
exercised his own mind a good deal. he admits that they have often
been found better than brethren or sons in the hour of danger, and are
capable of rendering important public services by informing against
offenders--for this they are to be rewarded; and the master who puts
a slave to death for the sake of concealing some crime which he has
committed, is held guilty of murder. but they are not always treated
with equal consideration. the punishments inflicted on them bear
no proportion to their crimes. they are to be addressed only in the
language of command. their masters are not to jest with them, lest they
should increase the hardship of their lot. some privileges were granted
to them by athenian law of which there is no mention in plato; they
were allowed to purchase their freedom from their master, and if they
despaired of being liberated by him they could demand to be sold, on the
chance of falling into better hands. but there is no suggestion in
the laws that a slave who tried to escape should be branded with the
words--kateche me, pheugo, or that evidence should be extracted from him
by torture, that the whole household was to be executed if the master
was murdered and the perpetrator remained undetected: all these were
provisions of athenian law. plato is more consistent than either the
athenians or the spartans; for at sparta too the helots were treated in
a manner almost unintelligible to us. on the one hand, they had arms put
into their hands, and served in the army, not only, as at plataea, in
attendance on their masters, but, after they had been manumitted, as a
separate body of troops called neodamodes: on the other hand, they were
the victims of one of the greatest crimes recorded in greek history
(thucyd.). the two great philosophers of hellas sought to extricate
themselves from this cruel condition of human life, but acquiesced in
the necessity of it. a noble and pathetic sentiment of plato, suggested
by the thought of their misery, may be quoted in this place:--'the right
treatment of slaves is to behave properly to them, and to do to them, if
possible, even more justice than to those who are our equals; for he
who naturally and genuinely reverences justice, and hates injustice, is
discovered in his dealings with any class of men to whom he can easily
be unjust. and he who in regard to the natures and actions of his slaves
is undefiled by impiety and injustice, will best sow the seeds of virtue
in them; and this may be truly said of every master, and tyrant, and of
every other having authority in relation to his inferiors.'

all the citizens of the magnesian state were free and equal; there was
no distinction of rank among them, such as is believed to have prevailed
at sparta. their number was a fixed one, corresponding to the 5040 lots.
one of the results of this is the requirement that younger sons or those
who have been disinherited shall go out to a colony. at athens, where
there was not the same religious feeling against increasing the size of
the city, the number of citizens must have been liable to considerable
fluctuations. several classes of persons, who were not citizens by
birth, were admitted to the privilege. perpetual exiles from other
countries, people who settled there to practise a trade (telfy), any one
who had shown distinguished valour in the cause of athens, the plataeans
who escaped from the siege, metics and strangers who offered to serve
in the army, the slaves who fought at arginusae,--all these could or
did become citizens. even those who were only on one side of athenian
parentage were at more than one period accounted citizens. but at times
there seems to have arisen a feeling against this promiscuous extension
of the citizen body, an expression of which is to be found in the law
of pericles--monous athenaious einai tous ek duoin athenaion gegonotas
(plutarch, pericles); and at no time did the adopted citizen enjoy the
full rights of citizenship--e.g. he might not be elected archon or to
the office of priest (telfy), although this prohibition did not extend
to his children, if born of a citizen wife. plato never thinks of making
the metic, much less the slave, a citizen. his treatment of the former
class is at once more gentle and more severe than that which prevailed
at athens. he imposes upon them no tax but good behaviour, whereas at
athens they were required to pay twelve drachmae per annum, and to
have a patron: on the other hand, he only allows them to reside in the
magnesian state on condition of following a trade; they were required to
depart when their property exceeded that of the third class, and in any
case after a residence of twenty years, unless they could show that they
had conferred some great benefit on the state. this privileged position
reflects that of the isoteleis at athens, who were excused from the
metoikion. it is plato's greatest concession to the metic, as the
bestowal of freedom is his greatest concession to the slave.

lastly, there is a more general point of view under which the laws of
plato may be considered,--the principles of jurisprudence which are
contained in them. these are not formally announced, but are scattered
up and down, to be observed by the reflective reader for himself. some
of them are only the common principles which all courts of justice have
gathered from experience; others are peculiar and characteristic. that
judges should sit at fixed times and hear causes in a regular order,
that evidence should be laid before them, that false witnesses should
be disallowed, and corruption punished, that defendants should be
heard before they are convicted,--these are the rules, not only of the
hellenic courts, but of courts of law in all ages and countries.
but there are also points which are peculiar, and in which ancient
jurisprudence differs considerably from modern; some of them are of
great importance...it could not be said at athens, nor was it ever
contemplated by plato, that all men, including metics and slaves, should
be equal 'in the eye of the law.' there was some law for the slave, but
not much; no adequate protection was given him against the cruelty of
his master...it was a singular privilege granted, both by the athenian
and magnesian law, to a murdered man, that he might, before he died,
pardon his murderer, in which case no legal steps were afterwards to
be taken against him. this law is the remnant of an age in which the
punishment of offences against the person was the concern rather of
the individual and his kinsmen than of the state...plato's division of
crimes into voluntary and involuntary and those done from passion, only
partially agrees with the distinction which modern law has drawn between
murder and manslaughter; his attempt to analyze them is confused by the
socratic paradox, that 'all vice is involuntary'...it is singular that
both in the laws and at athens theft is commonly punished by a twofold
restitution of the article stolen. the distinction between civil and
criminal courts or suits was not yet recognized...possession gives a
right of property after a certain time...the religious aspect under
which certain offences were regarded greatly interfered with a just
and natural estimate of their guilt...as among ourselves, the intent to
murder was distinguished by plato from actual murder...we note that
both in plato and the laws of athens, libel in the market-place and
personality in the theatre were forbidden...both in plato and athenian
law, as in modern times, the accomplice of a crime is to be punished as
well as the principal...plato does not allow a witness in a cause to
act as a judge of it...oaths are not to be taken by the parties to a
suit...both at athens and in plato's laws capital punishment for
murder was not to be inflicted, if the offender was willing to go into
exile...respect for the dead, duty towards parents, are to be enforced
by the law as well as by public opinion...plato proclaims the noble
sentiment that the object of all punishment is the improvement of the
offender... finally, he repeats twice over, as with the voice of a
prophet, that the crimes of the fathers are not to be visited upon the
children. in this respect he is nobly distinguished from the oriental,
and indeed from the spirit of athenian law (compare telfy,--dei kai
autous kai tous ek touton atimous einai), as the hebrew in the age of
ezekial is from the jewish people of former ages.

of all plato's provisions the object is to bring the practice of the law
more into harmony with reason and philosophy; to secure impartiality,
and while acknowledging that every citizen has a right to share in the
administration of justice, to counteract the tendency of the courts to
become mere popular assemblies.

...

thus we have arrived at the end of the writings of plato, and at the
last stage of philosophy which was really his. for in what followed,
which we chiefly gather from the uncertain intimations of aristotle, the
spirit of the master no longer survived. the doctrine of ideas passed
into one of numbers; instead of advancing from the abstract to the
concrete, the theories of plato were taken out of their context, and
either asserted or refuted with a provoking literalism; the socratic or
platonic element in his teaching was absorbed into the pythagorean or
megarian. his poetry was converted into mysticism; his unsubstantial
visions were assailed secundum artem by the rules of logic. his
political speculations lost their interest when the freedom of hellas
had passed away. of all his writings the laws were the furthest removed
from the traditions of the platonic school in the next generation. both
his political and his metaphysical philosophy are for the most part
misinterpreted by aristotle. the best of him--his love of truth, and
his 'contemplation of all time and all existence,' was soonest lost; and
some of his greatest thoughts have slept in the ear of mankind almost
ever since they were first uttered.

we have followed him during his forty or fifty years of authorship, from
the beginning when he first attempted to depict the teaching of socrates
in a dramatic form, down to the time at which the character of socrates
had disappeared, and we have the latest reflections of plato's own mind
upon hellas and upon philosophy. he, who was 'the last of the poets,' in
his book of laws writes prose only; he has himself partly fallen
under the rhetorical influences which in his earlier dialogues he was
combating. the progress of his writings is also the history of his life;
we have no other authentic life of him. they are the true self of the
philosopher, stripped of the accidents of time and place. the great
effort which he makes is, first, to realize abstractions, secondly,
to connect them. in the attempt to realize them, he was carried into a
transcendental region in which he isolated them from experience, and we
pass out of the range of science into poetry or fiction. the fancies of
mythology for a time cast a veil over the gulf which divides phenomena
from onta (meno, phaedrus, symposium, phaedo). in his return to earth
plato meets with a difficulty which has long ceased to be a difficulty
to us. he cannot understand how these obstinate, unmanageable ideas,
residing alone in their heaven of abstraction, can be either combined
with one another, or adapted to phenomena (parmenides, philebus,
sophist). that which is the most familiar process of our own minds, to
him appeared to be the crowning achievement of the dialectical art. the
difficulty which in his own generation threatened to be the destruction
of philosophy, he has rendered unmeaning and ridiculous. for by his
conquests in the world of mind our thoughts are widened, and he has
furnished us with new dialectical instruments which are of greater
compass and power. we have endeavoured to see him as he truly was, a
great original genius struggling with unequal conditions of knowledge,
not prepared with a system nor evolving in a series of dialogues ideas
which he had long conceived, but contradictory, enquiring as he goes
along, following the argument, first from one point of view and then
from another, and therefore arriving at opposite conclusions, hovering
around the light, and sometimes dazzled with excess of light, but always
moving in the same element of ideal truth. we have seen him also in his
decline, when the wings of his imagination have begun to droop, but his
experience of life remains, and he turns away from the contemplation of
the eternal to take a last sad look at human affairs.

...

and so having brought into the world 'noble children' (phaedr.), he
rests from the labours of authorship. more than two thousand two hundred
years have passed away since he returned to the place of apollo and
the muses. yet the echo of his words continues to be heard among men,
because of all philosophers he has the most melodious voice. he is the
inspired prophet or teacher who can never die, the only one in whom the
outward form adequately represents the fair soul within; in whom the
thoughts of all who went before him are reflected and of all who come
after him are partly anticipated. other teachers of philosophy are dried
up and withered,--after a few centuries they have become dust; but he
is fresh and blooming, and is always begetting new ideas in the minds of
men. they are one-sided and abstract; but he has many sides of wisdom.
nor is he always consistent with himself, because he is always moving
onward, and knows that there are many more things in philosophy than can
be expressed in words, and that truth is greater than consistency. he
who approaches him in the most reverent spirit shall reap most of
the fruit of his wisdom; he who reads him by the light of ancient
commentators will have the least understanding of him.

we may see him with the eye of the mind in the groves of the academy,
or on the banks of the ilissus, or in the streets of athens, alone or
walking with socrates, full of those thoughts which have since become
the common possession of mankind. or we may compare him to a statue hid
away in some temple of zeus or apollo, no longer existing on earth,
a statue which has a look as of the god himself. or we may once more
imagine him following in another state of being the great company
of heaven which he beheld of old in a vision (phaedr.). so, 'partly
trifling, but with a certain degree of seriousness' (symp.), we linger
around the memory of a world which has passed away (phaedr.).





laws




book i.

persons of the dialogue: an athenian stranger, cleinias (a cretan),
megillus (a lacedaemonian).

athenian: tell me, strangers, is a god or some man supposed to be the
author of your laws?

cleinias: a god, stranger; in very truth a god: among us cretans he is
said to have been zeus, but in lacedaemon, whence our friend here comes,
i believe they would say that apollo is their lawgiver: would they not,
megillus?

megillus: certainly.

athenian: and do you, cleinias, believe, as homer tells, that every
ninth year minos went to converse with his olympian sire, and was
inspired by him to make laws for your cities?

cleinias: yes, that is our tradition; and there was rhadamanthus, a
brother of his, with whose name you are familiar; he is reputed to have
been the justest of men, and we cretans are of opinion that he earned
this reputation from his righteous administration of justice when he was
alive.

athenian: yes, and a noble reputation it was, worthy of a son of zeus.
as you and megillus have been trained in these institutions, i dare say
that you will not be unwilling to give an account of your government and
laws; on our way we can pass the time pleasantly in talking about them,
for i am told that the distance from cnosus to the cave and temple of
zeus is considerable; and doubtless there are shady places under the
lofty trees, which will protect us from this scorching sun. being no
longer young, we may often stop to rest beneath them, and get over the
whole journey without difficulty, beguiling the time by conversation.

cleinias: yes, stranger, and if we proceed onward we shall come to
groves of cypresses, which are of rare height and beauty, and there are
green meadows, in which we may repose and converse.

athenian: very good.

cleinias: very good, indeed; and still better when we see them; let us
move on cheerily.

athenian: i am willing--and first, i want to know why the law has
ordained that you shall have common meals and gymnastic exercises, and
wear arms.

cleinias: i think, stranger, that the aim of our institutions is easily
intelligible to any one. look at the character of our country: crete is
not like thessaly, a large plain; and for this reason they have horsemen
in thessaly, and we have runners--the inequality of the ground in our
country is more adapted to locomotion on foot; but then, if you have
runners you must have light arms--no one can carry a heavy weight when
running, and bows and arrows are convenient because they are light.
now all these regulations have been made with a view to war, and
the legislator appears to me to have looked to this in all his
arrangements:--the common meals, if i am not mistaken, were instituted
by him for a similar reason, because he saw that while they are in the
field the citizens are by the nature of the case compelled to take their
meals together for the sake of mutual protection. he seems to me to have
thought the world foolish in not understanding that all men are always
at war with one another; and if in war there ought to be common meals
and certain persons regularly appointed under others to protect an army,
they should be continued in peace. for what men in general term peace
would be said by him to be only a name; in reality every city is in a
natural state of war with every other, not indeed proclaimed by heralds,
but everlasting. and if you look closely, you will find that this was
the intention of the cretan legislator; all institutions, private as
well as public, were arranged by him with a view to war; in giving them
he was under the impression that no possessions or institutions are of
any value to him who is defeated in battle; for all the good things of
the conquered pass into the hands of the conquerors.

athenian: you appear to me, stranger, to have been thoroughly trained
in the cretan institutions, and to be well informed about them; will
you tell me a little more explicitly what is the principle of government
which you would lay down? you seem to imagine that a well-governed state
ought to be so ordered as to conquer all other states in war: am i right
in supposing this to be your meaning?

cleinias: certainly; and our lacedaemonian friend, if i am not mistaken,
will agree with me.

megillus: why, my good friend, how could any lacedaemonian say anything
else?

athenian: and is what you say applicable only to states, or also to
villages?

cleinias: to both alike.

athenian: the case is the same?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: and in the village will there be the same war of family
against family, and of individual against individual?

cleinias: the same.

athenian: and should each man conceive himself to be his own
enemy:--what shall we say?

cleinias: o athenian stranger--inhabitant of attica i will not call you,
for you seem to deserve rather to be named after the goddess herself,
because you go back to first principles,--you have thrown a light upon
the argument, and will now be better able to understand what i was just
saying,--that all men are publicly one another's enemies, and each man
privately his own.

(athenian: my good sir, what do you mean?)--

cleinias:...moreover, there is a victory and defeat--the first and best
of victories, the lowest and worst of defeats--which each man gains or
sustains at the hands, not of another, but of himself; this shows that
there is a war against ourselves going on within every one of us.

athenian: let us now reverse the order of the argument: seeing that
every individual is either his own superior or his own inferior, may we
say that there is the same principle in the house, the village, and the
state?

cleinias: you mean that in each of them there is a principle of
superiority or inferiority to self?

athenian: yes.

cleinias: you are quite right in asking the question, for there
certainly is such a principle, and above all in states; and the state
in which the better citizens win a victory over the mob and over the
inferior classes may be truly said to be better than itself, and may
be justly praised, where such a victory is gained, or censured in the
opposite case.

athenian: whether the better is ever really conquered by the worse, is
a question which requires more discussion, and may be therefore left for
the present. but i now quite understand your meaning when you say
that citizens who are of the same race and live in the same cities may
unjustly conspire, and having the superiority in numbers may overcome
and enslave the few just; and when they prevail, the state may be truly
called its own inferior and therefore bad; and when they are defeated,
its own superior and therefore good.

cleinias: your remark, stranger, is a paradox, and yet we cannot
possibly deny it.

athenian: here is another case for consideration;--in a family there
may be several brothers, who are the offspring of a single pair; very
possibly the majority of them may be unjust, and the just may be in a
minority.

cleinias: very possibly.

athenian: and you and i ought not to raise a question of words as to
whether this family and household are rightly said to be superior when
they conquer, and inferior when they are conquered; for we are not
now considering what may or may not be the proper or customary way of
speaking, but we are considering the natural principles of right and
wrong in laws.

cleinias: what you say, stranger, is most true.

megillus: quite excellent, in my opinion, as far as we have gone.

athenian: again; might there not be a judge over these brethren, of whom
we were speaking?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: now, which would be the better judge--one who destroyed the
bad and appointed the good to govern themselves; or one who, while
allowing the good to govern, let the bad live, and made them voluntarily
submit? or third, i suppose, in the scale of excellence might be placed
a judge, who, finding the family distracted, not only did not destroy
any one, but reconciled them to one another for ever after, and gave
them laws which they mutually observed, and was able to keep them
friends.

cleinias: the last would be by far the best sort of judge and
legislator.

athenian: and yet the aim of all the laws which he gave would be the
reverse of war.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and will he who constitutes the state and orders the life
of man have in view external war, or that kind of intestine war called
civil, which no one, if he could prevent, would like to have occurring
in his own state; and when occurring, every one would wish to be quit of
as soon as possible?

cleinias: he would have the latter chiefly in view.

athenian: and would he prefer that this civil war should be terminated
by the destruction of one of the parties, and by the victory of the
other, or that peace and friendship should be re-established, and that,
being reconciled, they should give their attention to foreign enemies?

cleinias: every one would desire the latter in the case of his own
state.

athenian: and would not that also be the desire of the legislator?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and would not every one always make laws for the sake of the
best?

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: but war, whether external or civil, is not the best, and the
need of either is to be deprecated; but peace with one another, and
good will, are best. nor is the victory of the state over itself to be
regarded as a really good thing, but as a necessity; a man might as
well say that the body was in the best state when sick and purged by
medicine, forgetting that there is also a state of the body which needs
no purge. and in like manner no one can be a true statesman, whether
he aims at the happiness of the individual or state, who looks only,
or first of all, to external warfare; nor will he ever be a sound
legislator who orders peace for the sake of war, and not war for the
sake of peace.

cleinias: i suppose that there is truth, stranger, in that remark of
yours; and yet i am greatly mistaken if war is not the entire aim and
object of our own institutions, and also of the lacedaemonian.

athenian: i dare say; but there is no reason why we should rudely
quarrel with one another about your legislators, instead of gently
questioning them, seeing that both we and they are equally in earnest.
please follow me and the argument closely:--and first i will put forward
tyrtaeus, an athenian by birth, but also a spartan citizen, who of all
men was most eager about war: well, he says,

     'i sing not, i care not, about any man,

even if he were the richest of men, and possessed every good (and
then he gives a whole list of them), if he be not at all times a brave
warrior.' i imagine that you, too, must have heard his poems; our
lacedaemonian friend has probably heard more than enough of them.

megillus: very true.

cleinias: and they have found their way from lacedaemon to crete.

athenian: come now and let us all join in asking this question of
tyrtaeus: o most divine poet, we will say to him, the excellent praise
which you have bestowed on those who excel in war sufficiently proves
that you are wise and good, and i and megillus and cleinias of cnosus
do, as i believe, entirely agree with you. but we should like to be
quite sure that we are speaking of the same men; tell us, then, do you
agree with us in thinking that there are two kinds of war; or what would
you say? a far inferior man to tyrtaeus would have no difficulty
in replying quite truly, that war is of two kinds,--one which is
universally called civil war, and is, as we were just now saying, of all
wars the worst; the other, as we should all admit, in which we fall out
with other nations who are of a different race, is a far milder form of
warfare.

cleinias: certainly, far milder.

athenian: well, now, when you praise and blame war in this high-flown
strain, whom are you praising or blaming, and to which kind of war are
you referring? i suppose that you must mean foreign war, if i am to
judge from expressions of yours in which you say that you abominate
those

'who refuse to look upon fields of blood, and will not draw near and
strike at their enemies.'

and we shall naturally go on to say to him,--you, tyrtaeus, as it seems,
praise those who distinguish themselves in external and foreign war; and
he must admit this.

cleinias: evidently.

athenian: they are good; but we say that there are still better men
whose virtue is displayed in the greatest of all battles. and we too
have a poet whom we summon as a witness, theognis, citizen of megara in
sicily:

'cyrnus,' he says, 'he who is faithful in a civil broil is worth his
weight in gold and silver.'

and such an one is far better, as we affirm, than the other in a more
difficult kind of war, much in the same degree as justice and temperance
and wisdom, when united with courage, are better than courage only; for
a man cannot be faithful and good in civil strife without having all
virtue. but in the war of which tyrtaeus speaks, many a mercenary
soldier will take his stand and be ready to die at his post, and yet
they are generally and almost without exception insolent, unjust,
violent men, and the most senseless of human beings. you will ask what
the conclusion is, and what i am seeking to prove: i maintain that
the divine legislator of crete, like any other who is worthy of
consideration, will always and above all things in making laws have
regard to the greatest virtue; which, according to theognis, is loyalty
in the hour of danger, and may be truly called perfect justice. whereas,
that virtue which tyrtaeus highly praises is well enough, and was
praised by the poet at the right time, yet in place and dignity may be
said to be only fourth rate (i.e., it ranks after justice, temperance,
and wisdom.).

cleinias: stranger, we are degrading our inspired lawgiver to a rank
which is far beneath him.

athenian: nay, i think that we degrade not him but ourselves, if we
imagine that lycurgus and minos laid down laws both in lacedaemon and
crete mainly with a view to war.

cleinias: what ought we to say then?

athenian: what truth and what justice require of us, if i am not
mistaken, when speaking in behalf of divine excellence;--that the
legislator when making his laws had in view not a part only, and this
the lowest part of virtue, but all virtue, and that he devised classes
of laws answering to the kinds of virtue; not in the way in which modern
inventors of laws make the classes, for they only investigate and offer
laws whenever a want is felt, and one man has a class of laws about
allotments and heiresses, another about assaults; others about ten
thousand other such matters. but we maintain that the right way of
examining into laws is to proceed as we have now done, and i admired the
spirit of your exposition; for you were quite right in beginning with
virtue, and saying that this was the aim of the giver of the law, but i
thought that you went wrong when you added that all his legislation had
a view only to a part, and the least part of virtue, and this called
forth my subsequent remarks. will you allow me then to explain how i
should have liked to have heard you expound the matter?

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: you ought to have said, stranger--the cretan laws are with
reason famous among the hellenes; for they fulfil the object of laws,
which is to make those who use them happy; and they confer every sort of
good. now goods are of two kinds: there are human and there are divine
goods, and the human hang upon the divine; and the state which attains
the greater, at the same time acquires the less, or, not having the
greater, has neither. of the lesser goods the first is health, the
second beauty, the third strength, including swiftness in running and
bodily agility generally, and the fourth is wealth, not the blind god
(pluto), but one who is keen of sight, if only he has wisdom for his
companion. for wisdom is chief and leader of the divine class of goods,
and next follows temperance; and from the union of these two with
courage springs justice, and fourth in the scale of virtue is courage.
all these naturally take precedence of the other goods, and this is the
order in which the legislator must place them, and after them he will
enjoin the rest of his ordinances on the citizens with a view to these,
the human looking to the divine, and the divine looking to their leader
mind. some of his ordinances will relate to contracts of marriage which
they make one with another, and then to the procreation and education of
children, both male and female; the duty of the lawgiver will be to take
charge of his citizens, in youth and age, and at every time of life,
and to give them punishments and rewards; and in reference to all their
intercourse with one another, he ought to consider their pains and
pleasures and desires, and the vehemence of all their passions; he
should keep a watch over them, and blame and praise them rightly by the
mouth of the laws themselves. also with regard to anger and terror, and
the other perturbations of the soul, which arise out of misfortune, and
the deliverances from them which prosperity brings, and the experiences
which come to men in diseases, or in war, or poverty, or the opposite
of these; in all these states he should determine and teach what is
the good and evil of the condition of each. in the next place, the
legislator has to be careful how the citizens make their money and in
what way they spend it, and to have an eye to their mutual contracts and
dissolutions of contracts, whether voluntary or involuntary: he should
see how they order all this, and consider where justice as well as
injustice is found or is wanting in their several dealings with one
another; and honour those who obey the law, and impose fixed penalties
on those who disobey, until the round of civil life is ended, and the
time has come for the consideration of the proper funeral rites and
honours of the dead. and the lawgiver reviewing his work, will appoint
guardians to preside over these things,--some who walk by intelligence,
others by true opinion only, and then mind will bind together all his
ordinances and show them to be in harmony with temperance and justice,
and not with wealth or ambition. this is the spirit, stranger, in which
i was and am desirous that you should pursue the subject. and i want to
know the nature of all these things, and how they are arranged in the
laws of zeus, as they are termed, and in those of the pythian apollo,
which minos and lycurgus gave; and how the order of them is discovered
to his eyes, who has experience in laws gained either by study or habit,
although they are far from being self-evident to the rest of mankind
like ourselves.

cleinias: how shall we proceed, stranger?

athenian: i think that we must begin again as before, and first consider
the habit of courage; and then we will go on and discuss another and
then another form of virtue, if you please. in this way we shall have
a model of the whole; and with these and similar discourses we will
beguile the way. and when we have gone through all the virtues, we will
show, by the grace of god, that the institutions of which i was speaking
look to virtue.

megillus: very good; and suppose that you first criticize this praiser
of zeus and the laws of crete.

athenian: i will try to criticize you and myself, as well as him, for
the argument is a common concern. tell me,--were not first the syssitia,
and secondly the gymnasia, invented by your legislator with a view to
war?

megillus: yes.

athenian: and what comes third, and what fourth? for that, i think, is
the sort of enumeration which ought to be made of the remaining parts
of virtue, no matter whether you call them parts or what their name is,
provided the meaning is clear.

megillus: then i, or any other lacedaemonian, would reply that hunting
is third in order.

athenian: let us see if we can discover what comes fourth and fifth.

megillus: i think that i can get as far as the fourth head, which is
the frequent endurance of pain, exhibited among us spartans in certain
hand-to-hand fights; also in stealing with the prospect of getting a
good beating; there is, too, the so-called crypteia, or secret service,
in which wonderful endurance is shown,--our people wander over the whole
country by day and by night, and even in winter have not a shoe to
their foot, and are without beds to lie upon, and have to attend upon
themselves. marvellous, too, is the endurance which our citizens show in
their naked exercises, contending against the violent summer heat; and
there are many similar practices, to speak of which in detail would be
endless.

athenian: excellent, o lacedaemonian stranger. but how ought we to
define courage? is it to be regarded only as a combat against fears and
pains, or also against desires and pleasures, and against flatteries;
which exercise such a tremendous power, that they make the hearts even
of respectable citizens to melt like wax?

megillus: i should say the latter.

athenian: in what preceded, as you will remember, our cnosian friend was
speaking of a man or a city being inferior to themselves:--were you not,
cleinias?

cleinias: i was.

athenian: now, which is in the truest sense inferior, the man who is
overcome by pleasure or by pain?

cleinias: i should say the man who is overcome by pleasure; for all men
deem him to be inferior in a more disgraceful sense, than the other who
is overcome by pain.

athenian: but surely the lawgivers of crete and lacedaemon have not
legislated for a courage which is lame of one leg, able only to meet
attacks which come from the left, but impotent against the insidious
flatteries which come from the right?

cleinias: able to meet both, i should say.

athenian: then let me once more ask, what institutions have you in
either of your states which give a taste of pleasures, and do not avoid
them any more than they avoid pains; but which set a person in the midst
of them, and compel or induce him by the prospect of reward to get the
better of them? where is an ordinance about pleasure similar to that
about pain to be found in your laws? tell me what there is of this
nature among you:--what is there which makes your citizen equally brave
against pleasure and pain, conquering what they ought to conquer, and
superior to the enemies who are most dangerous and nearest home?

megillus: i was able to tell you, stranger, many laws which were
directed against pain; but i do not know that i can point out any great
or obvious examples of similar institutions which are concerned with
pleasure; there are some lesser provisions, however, which i might
mention.

cleinias: neither can i show anything of that sort which is at all
equally prominent in the cretan laws.

athenian: no wonder, my dear friends; and if, as is very likely, in our
search after the true and good, one of us may have to censure the laws
of the others, we must not be offended, but take kindly what another
says.

cleinias: you are quite right, athenian stranger, and we will do as you
say.

athenian: at our time of life, cleinias, there should be no feeling of
irritation.

cleinias: certainly not.

athenian: i will not at present determine whether he who censures the
cretan or lacedaemonian polities is right or wrong. but i believe that
i can tell better than either of you what the many say about them. for
assuming that you have reasonably good laws, one of the best of them
will be the law forbidding any young men to enquire which of them are
right or wrong; but with one mouth and one voice they must all agree
that the laws are all good, for they came from god; and any one who says
the contrary is not to be listened to. but an old man who remarks any
defect in your laws may communicate his observation to a ruler or to an
equal in years when no young man is present.

cleinias: exactly so, stranger; and like a diviner, although not
there at the time, you seem to me quite to have hit the meaning of the
legislator, and to say what is most true.

athenian: as there are no young men present, and the legislator
has given old men free licence, there will be no impropriety in our
discussing these very matters now that we are alone.

cleinias: true. and therefore you may be as free as you like in your
censure of our laws, for there is no discredit in knowing what is wrong;
he who receives what is said in a generous and friendly spirit will be
all the better for it.

athenian: very good; however, i am not going to say anything against
your laws until to the best of my ability i have examined them, but i am
going to raise doubts about them. for you are the only people known to
us, whether greek or barbarian, whom the legislator commanded to eschew
all great pleasures and amusements and never to touch them; whereas
in the matter of pains or fears which we have just been discussing, he
thought that they who from infancy had always avoided pains and fears
and sorrows, when they were compelled to face them would run away from
those who were hardened in them, and would become their subjects. now
the legislator ought to have considered that this was equally true of
pleasure; he should have said to himself, that if our citizens are from
their youth upward unacquainted with the greatest pleasures, and unused
to endure amid the temptations of pleasure, and are not disciplined
to refrain from all things evil, the sweet feeling of pleasure will
overcome them just as fear would overcome the former class; and in
another, and even a worse manner, they will be the slaves of those
who are able to endure amid pleasures, and have had the opportunity of
enjoying them, they being often the worst of mankind. one half of their
souls will be a slave, the other half free; and they will not be worthy
to be called in the true sense men and freemen. tell me whether you
assent to my words?

cleinias: on first hearing, what you say appears to be the truth; but to
be hasty in coming to a conclusion about such important matters would be
very childish and simple.

athenian: suppose, cleinias and megillus, that we consider the virtue
which follows next of those which we intended to discuss (for after
courage comes temperance), what institutions shall we find relating to
temperance, either in crete or lacedaemon, which, like your military
institutions, differ from those of any ordinary state.

megillus: that is not an easy question to answer; still i should say
that the common meals and gymnastic exercises have been excellently
devised for the promotion both of temperance and courage.

athenian: there seems to be a difficulty, stranger, with regard to
states, in making words and facts coincide so that there can be no
dispute about them. as in the human body, the regimen which does good in
one way does harm in another; and we can hardly say that any one course
of treatment is adapted to a particular constitution. now the gymnasia
and common meals do a great deal of good, and yet they are a source of
evil in civil troubles; as is shown in the case of the milesian, and
boeotian, and thurian youth, among whom these institutions seem always
to have had a tendency to degrade the ancient and natural custom of love
below the level, not only of man, but of the beasts. the charge may be
fairly brought against your cities above all others, and is true also
of most other states which especially cultivate gymnastics. whether
such matters are to be regarded jestingly or seriously, i think that
the pleasure is to be deemed natural which arises out of the intercourse
between men and women; but that the intercourse of men with men, or of
women with women, is contrary to nature, and that the bold attempt was
originally due to unbridled lust. the cretans are always accused of
having invented the story of ganymede and zeus because they wanted
to justify themselves in the enjoyment of unnatural pleasures by the
practice of the god whom they believe to have been their lawgiver.
leaving the story, we may observe that any speculation about laws turns
almost entirely on pleasure and pain, both in states and in individuals:
these are two fountains which nature lets flow, and he who draws from
them where and when, and as much as he ought, is happy; and this
holds of men and animals--of individuals as well as states; and he who
indulges in them ignorantly and at the wrong time, is the reverse of
happy.

megillus: i admit, stranger, that your words are well spoken, and i
hardly know what to say in answer to you; but still i think that the
spartan lawgiver was quite right in forbidding pleasure. of the cretan
laws, i shall leave the defence to my cnosian friend. but the laws of
sparta, in as far as they relate to pleasure, appear to me to be the
best in the world; for that which leads mankind in general into the
wildest pleasure and licence, and every other folly, the law has clean
driven out; and neither in the country nor in towns which are under the
control of sparta, will you find revelries and the many incitements of
every kind of pleasure which accompany them; and any one who meets a
drunken and disorderly person, will immediately have him most severely
punished, and will not let him off on any pretence, not even at the time
of a dionysiac festival; although i have remarked that this may happen
at your performances 'on the cart,' as they are called; and among our
tarentine colonists i have seen the whole city drunk at a dionysiac
festival; but nothing of the sort happens among us.

athenian: o lacedaemonian stranger, these festivities are praiseworthy
where there is a spirit of endurance, but are very senseless when they
are under no regulations. in order to retaliate, an athenian has only
to point out the licence which exists among your women. to all such
accusations, whether they are brought against the tarentines, or us, or
you, there is one answer which exonerates the practice in question from
impropriety. when a stranger expresses wonder at the singularity of
what he sees, any inhabitant will naturally answer him:--wonder not, o
stranger; this is our custom, and you may very likely have some other
custom about the same things. now we are speaking, my friends, not
about men in general, but about the merits and defects of the lawgivers
themselves. let us then discourse a little more at length about
intoxication, which is a very important subject, and will seriously task
the discrimination of the legislator. i am not speaking of drinking,
or not drinking, wine at all, but of intoxication. are we to follow the
custom of the scythians, and persians, and carthaginians, and celts, and
iberians, and thracians, who are all warlike nations, or that of your
countrymen, for they, as you say, altogether abstain? but the scythians
and thracians, both men and women, drink unmixed wine, which they pour
on their garments, and this they think a happy and glorious institution.
the persians, again, are much given to other practices of luxury which
you reject, but they have more moderation in them than the thracians and
scythians.

megillus: o best of men, we have only to take arms into our hands, and
we send all these nations flying before us.

athenian: nay, my good friend, do not say that; there have been, as
there always will be, flights and pursuits of which no account can be
given, and therefore we cannot say that victory or defeat in battle
affords more than a doubtful proof of the goodness or badness of
institutions. for when the greater states conquer and enslave the
lesser, as the syracusans have done the locrians, who appear to be the
best-governed people in their part of the world, or as the athenians
have done the ceans (and there are ten thousand other instances of the
same sort of thing), all this is not to the point; let us endeavour
rather to form a conclusion about each institution in itself and say
nothing, at present, of victories and defeats. let us only say that such
and such a custom is honourable, and another not. and first permit me to
tell you how good and bad are to be estimated in reference to these very
matters.

megillus: how do you mean?

athenian: all those who are ready at a moment's notice to praise or
censure any practice which is matter of discussion, seem to me to
proceed in a wrong way. let me give you an illustration of what i
mean:--you may suppose a person to be praising wheat as a good kind
of food, whereupon another person instantly blames wheat, without ever
enquiring into its effect or use, or in what way, or to whom, or with
what, or in what state and how, wheat is to be given. and that is just
what we are doing in this discussion. at the very mention of the word
intoxication, one side is ready with their praises and the other with
their censures; which is absurd. for either side adduce their witnesses
and approvers, and some of us think that we speak with authority because
we have many witnesses; and others because they see those who abstain
conquering in battle, and this again is disputed by us. now i cannot say
that i shall be satisfied, if we go on discussing each of the remaining
laws in the same way. and about this very point of intoxication i should
like to speak in another way, which i hold to be the right one; for if
number is to be the criterion, are there not myriads upon myriads of
nations ready to dispute the point with you, who are only two cities?

megillus: i shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which is right.

athenian: let me put the matter thus:--suppose a person to praise the
keeping of goats, and the creatures themselves as capital things to
have, and then some one who had seen goats feeding without a goatherd
in cultivated spots, and doing mischief, were to censure a goat or any
other animal who has no keeper, or a bad keeper, would there be any
sense or justice in such censure?

megillus: certainly not.

athenian: does a captain require only to have nautical knowledge in
order to be a good captain, whether he is sea-sick or not? what do you
say?

megillus: i say that he is not a good captain if, although he have
nautical skill, he is liable to sea-sickness.

athenian: and what would you say of the commander of an army? will he be
able to command merely because he has military skill if he be a coward,
who, when danger comes, is sick and drunk with fear?

megillus: impossible.

athenian: and what if besides being a coward he has no skill?

megillus: he is a miserable fellow, not fit to be a commander of men,
but only of old women.

athenian: and what would you say of some one who blames or praises any
sort of meeting which is intended by nature to have a ruler, and is well
enough when under his presidency? the critic, however, has never seen
the society meeting together at an orderly feast under the control of a
president, but always without a ruler or with a bad one:--when observers
of this class praise or blame such meetings, are we to suppose that what
they say is of any value?

megillus: certainly not, if they have never seen or been present at such
a meeting when rightly ordered.

athenian: reflect; may not banqueters and banquets be said to constitute
a kind of meeting?

megillus: of course.

athenian: and did any one ever see this sort of convivial meeting
rightly ordered? of course you two will answer that you have never seen
them at all, because they are not customary or lawful in your country;
but i have come across many of them in many different places, and
moreover i have made enquiries about them wherever i went, as i may say,
and never did i see or hear of anything of the kind which was carried on
altogether rightly; in some few particulars they might be right, but in
general they were utterly wrong.

cleinias: what do you mean, stranger, by this remark? explain. for we,
as you say, from our inexperience in such matters, might very likely
not know, even if they came in our way, what was right or wrong in such
societies.

athenian: likely enough; then let me try to be your instructor: you
would acknowledge, would you not, that in all gatherings of mankind, of
whatever sort, there ought to be a leader?

cleinias: certainly i should.

athenian: and we were saying just now, that when men are at war the
leader ought to be a brave man?

cleinias: we were.

athenian: the brave man is less likely than the coward to be disturbed
by fears?

cleinias: that again is true.

athenian: and if there were a possibility of having a general of an
army who was absolutely fearless and imperturbable, should we not by all
means appoint him?

cleinias: assuredly.

athenian: now, however, we are speaking not of a general who is to
command an army, when foe meets foe in time of war, but of one who is to
regulate meetings of another sort, when friend meets friend in time of
peace.

cleinias: true.

athenian: and that sort of meeting, if attended with drunkenness, is apt
to be unquiet.

cleinias: certainly; the reverse of quiet.

athenian: in the first place, then, the revellers as well as the
soldiers will require a ruler?

cleinias: to be sure; no men more so.

athenian: and we ought, if possible, to provide them with a quiet ruler?

cleinias: of course.

athenian: and he should be a man who understands society; for his duty
is to preserve the friendly feelings which exist among the company
at the time, and to increase them for the future by his use of the
occasion.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: must we not appoint a sober man and a wise to be our master of
the revels? for if the ruler of drinkers be himself young and drunken,
and not over-wise, only by some special good fortune will he be saved
from doing some great evil.

cleinias: it will be by a singular good fortune that he is saved.

athenian: now suppose such associations to be framed in the best way
possible in states, and that some one blames the very fact of their
existence--he may very likely be right. but if he blames a practice
which he only sees very much mismanaged, he shows in the first place
that he is not aware of the mismanagement, and also not aware that
everything done in this way will turn out to be wrong, because done
without the superintendence of a sober ruler. do you not see that a
drunken pilot or a drunken ruler of any sort will ruin ship, chariot,
army--anything, in short, of which he has the direction?

cleinias: the last remark is very true, stranger; and i see quite
clearly the advantage of an army having a good leader--he will give
victory in war to his followers, which is a very great advantage; and
so of other things. but i do not see any similar advantage which either
individuals or states gain from the good management of a feast; and i
want you to tell me what great good will be effected, supposing that
this drinking ordinance is duly established.

athenian: if you mean to ask what great good accrues to the state from
the right training of a single youth, or of a single chorus--when the
question is put in that form, we cannot deny that the good is not very
great in any particular instance. but if you ask what is the good of
education in general, the answer is easy--that education makes good
men, and that good men act nobly, and conquer their enemies in battle,
because they are good. education certainly gives victory, although
victory sometimes produces forgetfulness of education; for many have
grown insolent from victory in war, and this insolence has engendered in
them innumerable evils; and many a victory has been and will be suicidal
to the victors; but education is never suicidal.

cleinias: you seem to imply, my friend, that convivial meetings, when
rightly ordered, are an important element of education.

athenian: certainly i do.

cleinias: and can you show that what you have been saying is true?

athenian: to be absolutely sure of the truth of matters concerning which
there are many opinions, is an attribute of the gods not given to man,
stranger; but i shall be very happy to tell you what i think, especially
as we are now proposing to enter on a discussion concerning laws and
constitutions.

cleinias: your opinion, stranger, about the questions which are now
being raised, is precisely what we want to hear.

athenian: very good; i will try to find a way of explaining my meaning,
and you shall try to have the gift of understanding me. but first let me
make an apology. the athenian citizen is reputed among all the hellenes
to be a great talker, whereas sparta is renowned for brevity, and the
cretans have more wit than words. now i am afraid of appearing to elicit
a very long discourse out of very small materials. for drinking indeed
may appear to be a slight matter, and yet is one which cannot be rightly
ordered according to nature, without correct principles of music; these
are

necessary to any clear or satisfactory treatment of the subject, and
music again runs up into education generally, and there is much to be
said about all this. what would you say then to leaving these matters
for the present, and passing on to some other question of law?

megillus: o athenian stranger, let me tell you what perhaps you do not
know, that our family is the proxenus of your state. i imagine that
from their earliest youth all boys, when they are told that they are the
proxeni of a particular state, feel kindly towards their second country;
and this has certainly been my own feeling. i can well remember from the
days of my boyhood, how, when any lacedaemonians praised or blamed
the athenians, they used to say to me,--'see, megillus, how ill or how
well,' as the case might be, 'has your state treated us'; and having
always had to fight your battles against detractors when i heard you
assailed, i became warmly attached to you. and i always like to hear
the athenian tongue spoken; the common saying is quite true, that a good
athenian is more than ordinarily good, for he is the only man who is
freely and genuinely good by the divine inspiration of his own nature,
and is not manufactured. therefore be assured that i shall like to hear
you say whatever you have to say.

cleinias: yes, stranger; and when you have heard me speak, say boldly
what is in your thoughts. let me remind you of a tie which unites you to
crete. you must have heard here the story of the prophet epimenides, who
was of my family, and came to athens ten years before the persian war,
in accordance with the response of the oracle, and offered certain
sacrifices which the god commanded. the athenians were at that time in
dread of the persian invasion; and he said that for ten years they would
not come, and that when they came, they would go away again without
accomplishing any of their objects, and would suffer more evil than they
inflicted. at that time my forefathers formed ties of hospitality with
you; thus ancient is the friendship which i and my parents have had for
you.

athenian: you seem to be quite ready to listen; and i am also ready
to perform as much as i can of an almost impossible task, which i will
nevertheless attempt. at the outset of the discussion, let me define the
nature and power of education; for this is the way by which our argument
must travel onwards to the god dionysus.

cleinias: let us proceed, if you please.

athenian: well, then, if i tell you what are my notions of education,
will you consider whether they satisfy you?

cleinias: let us hear.

athenian: according to my view, any one who would be good at anything
must practise that thing from his youth upwards, both in sport and
earnest, in its several branches: for example, he who is to be a good
builder, should play at building children's houses; he who is to be a
good husbandman, at tilling the ground; and those who have the care of
their education should provide them when young with mimic tools. they
should learn beforehand the knowledge which they will afterwards require
for their art. for example, the future carpenter should learn to measure
or apply the line in play; and the future warrior should learn riding,
or some other exercise, for amusement, and the teacher should endeavour
to direct the children's inclinations and pleasures, by the help of
amusements, to their final aim in life. the most important part of
education is right training in the nursery. the soul of the child in his
play should be guided to the love of that sort of excellence in which
when he grows up to manhood he will have to be perfected. do you agree
with me thus far?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: then let us not leave the meaning of education ambiguous or
ill-defined. at present, when we speak in terms of praise or blame about
the bringing-up of each person, we call one man educated and another
uneducated, although the uneducated man may be sometimes very well
educated for the calling of a retail trader, or of a captain of a ship,
and the like. for we are not speaking of education in this narrower
sense, but of that other education in virtue from youth upwards, which
makes a man eagerly pursue the ideal perfection of citizenship, and
teaches him how rightly to rule and how to obey. this is the only
education which, upon our view, deserves the name; that other sort of
training, which aims at the acquisition of wealth or bodily strength,
or mere cleverness apart from intelligence and justice, is mean and
illiberal, and is not worthy to be called education at all. but let us
not quarrel with one another about a word, provided that the proposition
which has just been granted hold good: to wit, that those who are
rightly educated generally become good men. neither must we cast a
slight upon education, which is the first and fairest thing that the
best of men can ever have, and which, though liable to take a wrong
direction, is capable of reformation. and this work of reformation is
the great business of every man while he lives.

cleinias: very true; and we entirely agree with you.

athenian: and we agreed before that they are good men who are able to
rule themselves, and bad men who are not.

cleinias: you are quite right.

athenian: let me now proceed, if i can, to clear up the subject a little
further by an illustration which i will offer you.

cleinias: proceed.

athenian: do we not consider each of ourselves to be one?

cleinias: we do.

athenian: and each one of us has in his bosom two counsellors, both
foolish and also antagonistic; of which we call the one pleasure, and
the other pain.

cleinias: exactly.

athenian: also there are opinions about the future, which have the
general name of expectations; and the specific name of fear, when the
expectation is of pain; and of hope, when of pleasure; and further,
there is reflection about the good or evil of them, and this, when
embodied in a decree by the state, is called law.

cleinias: i am hardly able to follow you; proceed, however, as if i
were.

megillus: i am in the like case.

athenian: let us look at the matter thus: may we not conceive each of us
living beings to be a puppet of the gods, either their plaything only,
or created with a purpose--which of the two we cannot certainly know?
but we do know, that these affections in us are like cords and strings,
which pull us different and opposite ways, and to opposite actions; and
herein lies the difference between virtue and vice. according to the
argument there is one among these cords which every man ought to grasp
and never let go, but to pull with it against all the rest; and this is
the sacred and golden cord of reason, called by us the common law of the
state; there are others which are hard and of iron, but this one is soft
because golden; and there are several other kinds. now we ought always
to cooperate with the lead of the best, which is law. for inasmuch as
reason is beautiful and gentle, and not violent, her rule must needs
have ministers in order to help the golden principle in vanquishing the
other principles. and thus the moral of the tale about our being puppets
will not have been lost, and the meaning of the expression 'superior
or inferior to a man's self' will become clearer; and the individual,
attaining to right reason in this matter of pulling the strings of the
puppet, should live according to its rule; while the city, receiving the
same from some god or from one who has knowledge of these things, should
embody it in a law, to be her guide in her dealings with herself and
with other states. in this way virtue and vice will be more clearly
distinguished by us. and when they have become clearer, education and
other institutions will in like manner become clearer; and in particular
that question of convivial entertainment, which may seem, perhaps, to
have been a very trifling matter, and to have taken a great many more
words than were necessary.

cleinias: perhaps, however, the theme may turn out not to be unworthy of
the length of discourse.

athenian: very good; let us proceed with any enquiry which really bears
on our present object.

cleinias: proceed.

athenian: suppose that we give this puppet of ours drink,--what will be
the effect on him?

cleinias: having what in view do you ask that question?

athenian: nothing as yet; but i ask generally, when the puppet is
brought to the drink, what sort of result is likely to follow. i will
endeavour to explain my meaning more clearly: what i am now asking is
this--does the drinking of wine heighten and increase pleasures and
pains, and passions and loves?

cleinias: very greatly.

athenian: and are perception and memory, and opinion and prudence,
heightened and increased? do not these qualities entirely desert a man
if he becomes saturated with drink?

cleinias: yes, they entirely desert him.

athenian: does he not return to the state of soul in which he was when a
young child?

cleinias: he does.

athenian: then at that time he will have the least control over himself?

cleinias: the least.

athenian: and will he not be in a most wretched plight?

cleinias: most wretched.

athenian: then not only an old man but also a drunkard becomes a second
time a child?

cleinias: well said, stranger.

athenian: is there any argument which will prove to us that we ought to
encourage the taste for drinking instead of doing all we can to avoid
it?

cleinias: i suppose that there is; you at any rate, were just now saying
that you were ready to maintain such a doctrine.

athenian: true, i was; and i am ready still, seeing that you have both
declared that you are anxious to hear me.

cleinias: to be sure we are, if only for the strangeness of the paradox,
which asserts that a man ought of his own accord to plunge into utter
degradation.

athenian: are you speaking of the soul?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: and what would you say about the body, my friend? are you not
surprised at any one of his own accord bringing upon himself deformity,
leanness, ugliness, decrepitude?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: yet when a man goes of his own accord to a doctor's shop, and
takes medicine, is he not aware that soon, and for many days afterwards,
he will be in a state of body which he would die rather than accept
as the permanent condition of his life? are not those who train in
gymnasia, at first beginning reduced to a state of weakness?

cleinias: yes, all that is well known.

athenian: also that they go of their own accord for the sake of the
subsequent benefit?

cleinias: very good.

athenian: and we may conceive this to be true in the same way of other
practices?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and the same view may be taken of the pastime of drinking
wine, if we are right in supposing that the same good effect follows?

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: if such convivialities should turn out to have any advantage
equal in importance to that of gymnastic, they are in their very nature
to be preferred to mere bodily exercise, inasmuch as they have no
accompaniment of pain.

cleinias: true; but i hardly think that we shall be able to discover any
such benefits to be derived from them.

athenian: that is just what we must endeavour to show. and let me ask
you a question:--do we not distinguish two kinds of fear, which are very
different?

cleinias: what are they?

athenian: there is the fear of expected evil.

cleinias: yes.

athenian: and there is the fear of an evil reputation; we are afraid of
being thought evil, because we do or say some dishonourable thing, which
fear we and all men term shame.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: these are the two fears, as i called them; one of which is the
opposite of pain and other fears, and the opposite also of the greatest
and most numerous sort of pleasures.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and does not the legislator and every one who is good for
anything, hold this fear in the greatest honour? this is what he terms
reverence, and the confidence which is the reverse of this he terms
insolence; and the latter he always deems to be a very great evil both
to individuals and to states.

cleinias: true.

athenian: does not this kind of fear preserve us in many important ways?
what is there which so surely gives victory and safety in war? for there
are two things which give victory--confidence before enemies, and fear
of disgrace before friends.

cleinias: there are.

athenian: then each of us should be fearless and also fearful; and why
we should be either has now been determined.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and when we want to make any one fearless, we and the law
bring him face to face with many fears.

cleinias: clearly.

athenian: and when we want to make him rightly fearful, must we not
introduce him to shameless pleasures, and train him to take up arms
against them, and to overcome them? or does this principle apply to
courage only, and must he who would be perfect in valour fight against
and overcome his own natural character,--since if he be unpractised and
inexperienced in such conflicts, he will not be half the man which he
might have been,--and are we to suppose, that with temperance it is
otherwise, and that he who has never fought with the shameless and
unrighteous temptations of his pleasures and lusts, and conquered them,
in earnest and in play, by word, deed, and act, will still be perfectly
temperate?

cleinias: a most unlikely supposition.

athenian: suppose that some god had given a fear-potion to men, and
that the more a man drank of this the more he regarded himself at
every draught as a child of misfortune, and that he feared everything
happening or about to happen to him; and that at last the most
courageous of men utterly lost his presence of mind for a time, and
only came to himself again when he had slept off the influence of the
draught.

cleinias: but has such a draught, stranger, ever really been known among
men?

athenian: no; but, if there had been, might not such a draught have been
of use to the legislator as a test of courage? might we not go and say
to him, 'o legislator, whether you are legislating for the cretan, or
for any other state, would you not like to have a touchstone of the
courage and cowardice of your citizens?'

cleinias: 'i should,' will be the answer of every one.

athenian: 'and you would rather have a touchstone in which there is no
risk and no great danger than the reverse?'

cleinias: in that proposition every one may safely agree.

athenian: 'and in order to make use of the draught, you would lead them
amid these imaginary terrors, and prove them, when the affection of fear
was working upon them, and compel them to be fearless, exhorting and
admonishing them; and also honouring them, but dishonouring any one who
will not be persuaded by you to be in all respects such as you command
him; and if he underwent the trial well and manfully, you would let him
go unscathed; but if ill, you would inflict a punishment upon him? or
would you abstain from using the potion altogether, although you have no
reason for abstaining?'

cleinias: he would be certain, stranger, to use the potion.

athenian: this would be a mode of testing and training which would
be wonderfully easy in comparison with those now in use, and might be
applied to a single person, or to a few, or indeed to any number; and
he would do well who provided himself with the potion only, rather than
with any number of other things, whether he preferred to be by himself
in solitude, and there contend with his fears, because he was ashamed to
be seen by the eye of man until he was perfect; or trusting to the force
of his own nature and habits, and believing that he had been already
disciplined sufficiently, he did not hesitate to train himself in
company with any number of others, and display his power in conquering
the irresistible change effected by the draught--his virtue being such,
that he never in any instance fell into any great unseemliness, but was
always himself, and left off before he arrived at the last cup, fearing
that he, like all other men, might be overcome by the potion.

cleinias: yes, stranger, in that last case, too, he might equally show
his self-control.

athenian: let us return to the lawgiver, and say to him:--'well,
lawgiver, there is certainly no such fear-potion which man has either
received from the gods or himself discovered; for witchcraft has no
place at our board. but is there any potion which might serve as a test
of overboldness and excessive and indiscreet boasting?

cleinias: i suppose that he will say, yes,--meaning that wine is such a
potion.

athenian: is not the effect of this quite the opposite of the effect of
the other? when a man drinks wine he begins to be better pleased with
himself, and the more he drinks the more he is filled full of brave
hopes, and conceit of his power, and at last the string of his tongue
is loosened, and fancying himself wise, he is brimming over with
lawlessness, and has no more fear or respect, and is ready to do or say
anything.

cleinias: i think that every one will admit the truth of your
description.

megillus: certainly.

athenian: now, let us remember, as we were saying, that there are two
things which should be cultivated in the soul: first, the greatest
courage; secondly, the greatest fear--

cleinias: which you said to be characteristic of reverence, if i am not
mistaken.

athenian: thank you for reminding me. but now, as the habit of courage
and fearlessness is to be trained amid fears, let us consider whether
the opposite quality is not also to be trained among opposites.

cleinias: that is probably the case.

athenian: there are times and seasons at which we are by nature more
than commonly valiant and bold; now we ought to train ourselves on these
occasions to be as free from impudence and shamelessness as possible,
and to be afraid to say or suffer or do anything that is base.

cleinias: true.

athenian: are not the moments in which we are apt to be bold and
shameless such as these?--when we are under the influence of anger,
love, pride, ignorance, avarice, cowardice? or when wealth, beauty,
strength, and all the intoxicating workings of pleasure madden us? what
is better adapted than the festive use of wine, in the first place to
test, and in the second place to train the character of a man, if care
be taken in the use of it? what is there cheaper, or more innocent? for
do but consider which is the greater risk:--would you rather test a man
of a morose and savage nature, which is the source of ten thousand acts
of injustice, by making bargains with him at a risk to yourself, or by
having him as a companion at the festival of dionysus? or would you, if
you wanted to apply a touchstone to a man who is prone to love, entrust
your wife, or your sons, or daughters to him, perilling your dearest
interests in order to have a view of the condition of his soul? i might
mention numberless cases, in which the advantage would be manifest of
getting to know a character in sport, and without paying dearly for
experience. and i do not believe that either a cretan, or any other
man, will doubt that such a test is a fair test, and safer, cheaper, and
speedier than any other.

cleinias: that is certainly true.

athenian: and this knowledge of the natures and habits of men's souls
will be of the greatest use in that art which has the management of
them; and that art, if i am not mistaken, is politics.

cleinias: exactly so.




book ii.

athenian: and now we have to consider whether the insight into human
nature is the only benefit derived from well-ordered potations, or
whether there are not other advantages great and much to be desired. the
argument seems to imply that there are. but how and in what way these
are to be attained, will have to be considered attentively, or we may be
entangled in error.

cleinias: proceed.

athenian: let me once more recall our doctrine of right education;
which, if i am not mistaken, depends on the due regulation of convivial
intercourse.

cleinias: you talk rather grandly.

athenian: pleasure and pain i maintain to be the first perceptions of
children, and i say that they are the forms under which virtue and
vice are originally present to them. as to wisdom and true and fixed
opinions, happy is the man who acquires them, even when declining in
years; and we may say that he who possesses them, and the blessings
which are contained in them, is a perfect man. now i mean by education
that training which is given by suitable habits to the first instincts
of virtue in children;--when pleasure, and friendship, and pain, and
hatred, are rightly implanted in souls not yet capable of understanding
the nature of them, and who find them, after they have attained reason,
to be in harmony with her. this harmony of the soul, taken as a whole,
is virtue; but the particular training in respect of pleasure and pain,
which leads you always to hate what you ought to hate, and love what you
ought to love from the beginning of life to the end, may be separated
off; and, in my view, will be rightly called education.

cleinias: i think, stranger, that you are quite right in all that you
have said and are saying about education.

athenian: i am glad to hear that you agree with me; for, indeed, the
discipline of pleasure and pain which, when rightly ordered, is a
principle of education, has been often relaxed and corrupted in human
life. and the gods, pitying the toils which our race is born to undergo,
have appointed holy festivals, wherein men alternate rest with labour;
and have given them the muses and apollo, the leader of the muses, and
dionysus, to be companions in their revels, that they may improve their
education by taking part in the festivals of the gods, and with their
help. i should like to know whether a common saying is in our opinion
true to nature or not. for men say that the young of all creatures
cannot be quiet in their bodies or in their voices; they are always
wanting to move and cry out; some leaping and skipping, and overflowing
with sportiveness and delight at something, others uttering all sorts of
cries. but, whereas the animals have no perception of order or disorder
in their movements, that is, of rhythm or harmony, as they are
called, to us, the gods, who, as we say, have been appointed to be our
companions in the dance, have given the pleasurable sense of harmony and
rhythm; and so they stir us into life, and we follow them, joining hands
together in dances and songs; and these they call choruses, which is a
term naturally expressive of cheerfulness. shall we begin, then, with
the acknowledgment that education is first given through apollo and the
muses? what do you say?

cleinias: i assent.

athenian: and the uneducated is he who has not been trained in the
chorus, and the educated is he who has been well trained?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and the chorus is made up of two parts, dance and song?

cleinias: true.

athenian: then he who is well educated will be able to sing and dance
well?

cleinias: i suppose that he will.

athenian: let us see; what are we saying?

cleinias: what?

athenian: he sings well and dances well; now must we add that he sings
what is good and dances what is good?

cleinias: let us make the addition.

athenian: we will suppose that he knows the good to be good, and the bad
to be bad, and makes use of them accordingly: which now is the better
trained in dancing and music--he who is able to move his body and to
use his voice in what is understood to be the right manner, but has no
delight in good or hatred of evil; or he who is incorrect in gesture and
voice, but is right in his sense of pleasure and pain, and welcomes what
is good, and is offended at what is evil?

cleinias: there is a great difference, stranger, in the two kinds of
education.

athenian: if we three know what is good in song and dance, then we truly
know also who is educated and who is uneducated; but if not, then we
certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard of education, and
whether there is any or not.

cleinias: true.

athenian: let us follow the scent like hounds, and go in pursuit of
beauty of figure, and melody, and song, and dance; if these escape us,
there will be no use in talking about true education, whether hellenic
or barbarian.

cleinias: yes.

athenian: and what is beauty of figure, or beautiful melody? when a
manly soul is in trouble, and when a cowardly soul is in similar
case, are they likely to use the same figures and gestures, or to give
utterance to the same sounds?

cleinias: how can they, when the very colours of their faces differ?

athenian: good, my friend; i may observe, however, in passing, that in
music there certainly are figures and there are melodies: and music is
concerned with harmony and rhythm, so that you may speak of a melody or
figure having good rhythm or good harmony--the term is correct enough;
but to speak metaphorically of a melody or figure having a 'good
colour,' as the masters of choruses do, is not allowable, although
you can speak of the melodies or figures of the brave and the coward,
praising the one and censuring the other. and not to be tedious, let us
say that the figures and melodies which are expressive of virtue of soul
or body, or of images of virtue, are without exception good, and those
which are expressive of vice are the reverse of good.

cleinias: your suggestion is excellent; and let us answer that these
things are so.

athenian: once more, are all of us equally delighted with every sort of
dance?

cleinias: far otherwise.

athenian: what, then, leads us astray? are beautiful things not the same
to us all, or are they the same in themselves, but not in our opinion
of them? for no one will admit that forms of vice in the dance are more
beautiful than forms of virtue, or that he himself delights in the forms
of vice, and others in a muse of another character. and yet most persons
say, that the excellence of music is to give pleasure to our souls.
but this is intolerable and blasphemous; there is, however, a much more
plausible account of the delusion.

cleinias: what?

athenian: the adaptation of art to the characters of men. choric
movements are imitations of manners occurring in various actions,
fortunes, dispositions,--each particular is imitated, and those to whom
the words, or songs, or dances are suited, either by nature or habit
or both, cannot help feeling pleasure in them and applauding them, and
calling them beautiful. but those whose natures, or ways, or habits are
unsuited to them, cannot delight in them or applaud them, and they call
them base. there are others, again, whose natures are right and their
habits wrong, or whose habits are right and their natures wrong, and
they praise one thing, but are pleased at another. for they say that
all these imitations are pleasant, but not good. and in the presence of
those whom they think wise, they are ashamed of dancing and singing in
the baser manner, or of deliberately lending any countenance to such
proceedings; and yet, they have a secret pleasure in them.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances or songs,
or any good done to the approver of the opposite sort of pleasure?

cleinias: i think that there is.

athenian: 'i think' is not the word, but i would say, rather, 'i
am certain.' for must they not have the same effect as when a man
associates with bad characters, whom he likes and approves rather than
dislikes, and only censures playfully because he has a suspicion of his
own badness? in that case, he who takes pleasure in them will surely
become like those in whom he takes pleasure, even though he be ashamed
to praise them. and what greater good or evil can any destiny ever make
us undergo?

cleinias: i know of none.

athenian: then in a city which has good laws, or in future ages is to
have them, bearing in mind the instruction and amusement which are given
by music, can we suppose that the poets are to be allowed to teach in
the dance anything which they themselves like, in the way of rhythm, or
melody, or words, to the young children of any well-conditioned parents?
is the poet to train his choruses as he pleases, without reference to
virtue or vice?

cleinias: that is surely quite unreasonable, and is not to be thought
of.

athenian: and yet he may do this in almost any state with the exception
of egypt.

cleinias: and what are the laws about music and dancing in egypt?

athenian: you will wonder when i tell you: long ago they appear to have
recognized the very principle of which we are now speaking--that their
young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains of virtue. these
they fixed, and exhibited the patterns of them in their temples; and
no painter or artist is allowed to innovate upon them, or to leave the
traditional forms and invent new ones. to this day, no alteration is
allowed either in these arts, or in music at all. and you will find that
their works of art are painted or moulded in the same forms which
they had ten thousand years ago;--this is literally true and no
exaggeration,--their ancient paintings and sculptures are not a whit
better or worse than the work of to-day, but are made with just the same
skill.

cleinias: how extraordinary!

athenian: i should rather say, how statesmanlike, how worthy of a
legislator! i know that other things in egypt are not so well. but what
i am telling you about music is true and deserving of consideration,
because showing that a lawgiver may institute melodies which have a
natural truth and correctness without any fear of failure. to do this,
however, must be the work of god, or of a divine person; in egypt they
have a tradition that their ancient chants which have been preserved for
so many ages are the composition of the goddess isis. and therefore, as
i was saying, if a person can only find in any way the natural melodies,
he may confidently embody them in a fixed and legal form. for the love
of novelty which arises out of pleasure in the new and weariness of the
old, has not strength enough to corrupt the consecrated song and dance,
under the plea that they have become antiquated. at any rate, they are
far from being corrupted in egypt.

cleinias: your arguments seem to prove your point.

athenian: may we not confidently say that the true use of music and
of choral festivities is as follows: we rejoice when we think that we
prosper, and again we think that we prosper when we rejoice?

cleinias: exactly.

athenian: and when rejoicing in our good fortune, we are unable to be
still?

cleinias: true.

athenian: our young men break forth into dancing and singing, and we who
are their elders deem that we are fulfilling our part in life when we
look on at them. having lost our agility, we delight in their sports and
merry-making, because we love to think of our former selves; and gladly
institute contests for those who are able to awaken in us the memory of
our youth.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: is it altogether unmeaning to say, as the common people do
about festivals, that he should be adjudged the wisest of men, and the
winner of the palm, who gives us the greatest amount of pleasure and
mirth? for on such occasions, and when mirth is the order of the day,
ought not he to be honoured most, and, as i was saying, bear the palm,
who gives most mirth to the greatest number? now is this a true way of
speaking or of acting?

cleinias: possibly.

athenian: but, my dear friend, let us distinguish between different
cases, and not be hasty in forming a judgment: one way of considering
the question will be to imagine a festival at which there are
entertainments of all sorts, including gymnastic, musical, and
equestrian contests: the citizens are assembled; prizes are offered,
and proclamation is made that any one who likes may enter the lists,
and that he is to bear the palm who gives the most pleasure to the
spectators--there is to be no regulation about the manner how; but he
who is most successful in giving pleasure is to be crowned victor, and
deemed to be the pleasantest of the candidates: what is likely to be the
result of such a proclamation?

cleinias: in what respect?

athenian: there would be various exhibitions: one man, like homer, will
exhibit a rhapsody, another a performance on the lute; one will have a
tragedy, and another a comedy. nor would there be anything astonishing
in some one imagining that he could gain the prize by exhibiting a
puppet-show. suppose these competitors to meet, and not these only, but
innumerable others as well--can you tell me who ought to be the victor?

cleinias: i do not see how any one can answer you, or pretend to know,
unless he has heard with his own ears the several competitors; the
question is absurd.

athenian: well, then, if neither of you can answer, shall i answer this
question which you deem so absurd?

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: if very small children are to determine the question, they
will decide for the puppet show.

cleinias: of course.

athenian: the older children will be advocates of comedy; educated
women, and young men, and people in general, will favour tragedy.

cleinias: very likely.

athenian: and i believe that we old men would have the greatest pleasure
in hearing a rhapsodist recite well the iliad and odyssey, or one of
the hesiodic poems, and would award the victory to him. but, who would
really be the victor?--that is the question.

cleinias: yes.

athenian: clearly you and i will have to declare that those whom we old
men adjudge victors ought to win; for our ways are far and away better
than any which at present exist anywhere in the world.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: thus far i too should agree with the many, that the excellence
of music is to be measured by pleasure. but the pleasure must not be
that of chance persons; the fairest music is that which delights the
best and best educated, and especially that which delights the one man
who is pre-eminent in virtue and education. and therefore the judges
must be men of character, for they will require both wisdom and courage;
the true judge must not draw his inspiration from the theatre, nor ought
he to be unnerved by the clamour of the many and his own incapacity;
nor again, knowing the truth, ought he through cowardice and unmanliness
carelessly to deliver a lying judgment, with the very same lips which
have just appealed to the gods before he judged. he is sitting not
as the disciple of the theatre, but, in his proper place, as their
instructor, and he ought to be the enemy of all pandering to the
pleasure of the spectators. the ancient and common custom of hellas,
which still prevails in italy and sicily, did certainly leave the
judgment to the body of spectators, who determined the victor by show of
hands. but this custom has been the destruction of the poets; for they
are now in the habit of composing with a view to please the bad taste
of their judges, and the result is that the spectators instruct
themselves;--and also it has been the ruin of the theatre; they ought
to be having characters put before them better than their own, and
so receiving a higher pleasure, but now by their own act the opposite
result follows. what inference is to be drawn from all this? shall i
tell you?

cleinias: what?

athenian: the inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth time
is, that education is the constraining and directing of youth towards
that right reason, which the law affirms, and which the experience of
the eldest and best has agreed to be truly right. in order, then, that
the soul of the child may not be habituated to feel joy and sorrow in
a manner at variance with the law, and those who obey the law, but may
rather follow the law and rejoice and sorrow at the same things as the
aged--in order, i say, to produce this effect, chants appear to have
been invented, which really enchant, and are designed to implant
that harmony of which we speak. and, because the mind of the child is
incapable of enduring serious training, they are called plays and songs,
and are performed in play; just as when men are sick and ailing in their
bodies, their attendants give them wholesome diet in pleasant meats and
drinks, but unwholesome diet in disagreeable things, in order that they
may learn, as they ought, to like the one, and to dislike the other. and
similarly the true legislator will persuade, and, if he cannot persuade,
will compel the poet to express, as he ought, by fair and noble words,
in his rhythms, the figures, and in his melodies, the music of temperate
and brave and in every way good men.

cleinias: but do you really imagine, stranger, that this is the way in
which poets generally compose in states at the present day? as far as i
can observe, except among us and among the lacedaemonians, there are no
regulations like those of which you speak; in other places novelties are
always being introduced in dancing and in music, generally not under the
authority of any law, but at the instigation of lawless pleasures; and
these pleasures are so far from being the same, as you describe the
egyptian to be, or having the same principles, that they are never the
same.

athenian: most true, cleinias; and i daresay that i may have expressed
myself obscurely, and so led you to imagine that i was speaking of
some really existing state of things, whereas i was only saying what
regulations i would like to have about music; and hence there occurred
a misapprehension on your part. for when evils are far gone and
irremediable, the task of censuring them is never pleasant, although at
times necessary. but as we do not really differ, will you let me ask you
whether you consider such institutions to be more prevalent among the
cretans and lacedaemonians than among the other hellenes?

cleinias: certainly they are.

athenian: and if they were extended to the other hellenes, would it be
an improvement on the present state of things?

cleinias: a very great improvement, if the customs which prevail among
them were such as prevail among us and the lacedaemonians, and such as
you were just now saying ought to prevail.

athenian: let us see whether we understand one another:--are not the
principles of education and music which prevail among you as follows:
you compel your poets to say that the good man, if he be temperate and
just, is fortunate and happy; and this whether he be great and strong or
small and weak, and whether he be rich or poor; and, on the other hand,
if he have a wealth passing that of cinyras or midas, and be unjust,
he is wretched and lives in misery? as the poet says, and with truth:
i sing not, i care not about him who accomplishes all noble things,
not having justice; let him who 'draws near and stretches out his hand
against his enemies be a just man.' but if he be unjust, i would not
have him 'look calmly upon bloody death,' nor 'surpass in swiftness the
thracian boreas;' and let no other thing that is called good ever be
his. for the goods of which the many speak are not really good: first
in the catalogue is placed health, beauty next, wealth third; and then
innumerable others, as for example to have a keen eye or a quick ear,
and in general to have all the senses perfect; or, again, to be a tyrant
and do as you like; and the final consummation of happiness is to have
acquired all these things, and when you have acquired them to become at
once immortal. but you and i say, that while to the just and holy all
these things are the best of possessions, to the unjust they are all,
including even health, the greatest of evils. for in truth, to have
sight, and hearing, and the use of the senses, or to live at all without
justice and virtue, even though a man be rich in all the so-called goods
of fortune, is the greatest of evils, if life be immortal; but not so
great, if the bad man lives only a very short time. these are the truths
which, if i am not mistaken, you will persuade or compel your poets to
utter with suitable accompaniments of harmony and rhythm, and in these
they must train up your youth. am i not right? for i plainly declare
that evils as they are termed are goods to the unjust, and only evils
to the just, and that goods are truly good to the good, but evil to the
evil. let me ask again, are you and i agreed about this?

cleinias: i think that we partly agree and partly do not.

athenian: when a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which lasts,
and when he is pre-eminent in strength and courage, and has the gift of
immortality, and none of the so-called evils which counter-balance these
goods, but only the injustice and insolence of his own nature--of such
an one you are, i suspect, unwilling to believe that he is miserable
rather than happy.

cleinias: that is quite true.

athenian: once more: suppose that he be valiant and strong, and handsome
and rich, and does throughout his whole life whatever he likes, still,
if he be unrighteous and insolent, would not both of you agree that he
will of necessity live basely? you will surely grant so much?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and an evil life too?

cleinias: i am not equally disposed to grant that.

athenian: will he not live painfully and to his own disadvantage?

cleinias: how can i possibly say so?

athenian: how! then may heaven make us to be of one mind, for now we are
of two. to me, dear cleinias, the truth of what i am saying is as plain
as the fact that crete is an island. and, if i were a lawgiver, i would
try to make the poets and all the citizens speak in this strain, and
i would inflict the heaviest penalties on any one in all the land who
should dare to say that there are bad men who lead pleasant lives, or
that the profitable and gainful is one thing, and the just another; and
there are many other matters about which i should make my citizens speak
in a manner different from the cretans and lacedaemonians of this age,
and i may say, indeed, from the world in general. for tell me, my good
friends, by zeus and apollo tell me, if i were to ask these same
gods who were your legislators,--is not the most just life also the
pleasantest? or are there two lives, one of which is the justest and the
other the pleasantest?--and they were to reply that there are two; and
thereupon i proceeded to ask, (that would be the right way of pursuing
the enquiry), which are the happier--those who lead the justest, or
those who lead the pleasantest life? and they replied, those who lead
the pleasantest--that would be a very strange answer, which i should not
like to put into the mouth of the gods. the words will come with more
propriety from the lips of fathers and legislators, and therefore i will
repeat my former questions to one of them, and suppose him to say again
that he who leads the pleasantest life is the happiest. and to that
i rejoin:--o my father, did you not wish me to live as happily as
possible? and yet you also never ceased telling me that i should live
as justly as possible. now, here the giver of the rule, whether he be
legislator or father, will be in a dilemma, and will in vain endeavour
to be consistent with himself. but if he were to declare that the
justest life is also the happiest, every one hearing him would enquire,
if i am not mistaken, what is that good and noble principle in life
which the law approves, and which is superior to pleasure. for what good
can the just man have which is separated from pleasure? shall we say
that glory and fame, coming from gods and men, though good and noble,
are nevertheless unpleasant, and infamy pleasant? certainly not, sweet
legislator. or shall we say that the not-doing of wrong and there being
no wrong done is good and honourable, although there is no pleasure in
it, and that the doing wrong is pleasant, but evil and base?

cleinias: impossible.

athenian: the view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant and
the just and the good and the noble has an excellent moral and religious
tendency. and the opposite view is most at variance with the designs of
the legislator, and is, in his opinion, infamous; for no one, if he
can help, will be persuaded to do that which gives him more pain than
pleasure. but as distant prospects are apt to make us dizzy, especially
in childhood, the legislator will try to purge away the darkness and
exhibit the truth; he will persuade the citizens, in some way or other,
by customs and praises and words, that just and unjust are shadows only,
and that injustice, which seems opposed to justice, when contemplated by
the unjust and evil man appears pleasant and the just most unpleasant;
but that from the just man's point of view, the very opposite is the
appearance of both of them.

cleinias: true.

athenian: and which may be supposed to be the truer judgment--that of
the inferior or of the better soul?

cleinias: surely, that of the better soul.

athenian: then the unjust life must not only be more base and depraved,
but also more unpleasant than the just and holy life?

cleinias: that seems to be implied in the present argument.

athenian: and even supposing this were otherwise, and not as the
argument has proven, still the lawgiver, who is worth anything, if
he ever ventures to tell a lie to the young for their good, could not
invent a more useful lie than this, or one which will have a better
effect in making them do what is right, not on compulsion but
voluntarily.

cleinias: truth, stranger, is a noble thing and a lasting, but a thing
of which men are hard to be persuaded.

athenian: and yet the story of the sidonian cadmus, which is so
improbable, has been readily believed, and also innumerable other tales.

cleinias: what is that story?

athenian: the story of armed men springing up after the sowing of teeth,
which the legislator may take as a proof that he can persuade the minds
of the young of anything; so that he has only to reflect and find out
what belief will be of the greatest public advantage, and then use all
his efforts to make the whole community utter one and the same word in
their songs and tales and discourses all their life long. but if you do
not agree with me, there is no reason why you should not argue on the
other side.

cleinias: i do not see that any argument can fairly be raised by either
of us against what you are now saying.

athenian: the next suggestion which i have to offer is, that all our
three choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls of children,
reciting in their strains all the noble thoughts of which we have
already spoken, or are about to speak; and the sum of them shall be,
that the life which is by the gods deemed to be the happiest is also the
best;--we shall affirm this to be a most certain truth; and the minds of
our young disciples will be more likely to receive these words of ours
than any others which we might address to them.

cleinias: i assent to what you say.

athenian: first will enter in their natural order the sacred choir
composed of children, which is to sing lustily the heaven-taught lay to
the whole city. next will follow the choir of young men under the age
of thirty, who will call upon the god paean to testify to the truth of
their words, and will pray him to be gracious to the youth and to turn
their hearts. thirdly, the choir of elder men, who are from thirty to
sixty years of age, will also sing. there remain those who are too old
to sing, and they will tell stories, illustrating the same virtues, as
with the voice of an oracle.

cleinias: who are those who compose the third choir, stranger? for i do
not clearly understand what you mean to say about them.

athenian: and yet almost all that i have been saying has been said with
a view to them.

cleinias: will you try to be a little plainer?

athenian: i was speaking at the commencement of our discourse, as you
will remember, of the fiery nature of young creatures: i said that they
were unable to keep quiet either in limb or voice, and that they called
out and jumped about in a disorderly manner; and that no other animal
attained to any perception of order, but man only. now the order of
motion is called rhythm, and the order of the voice, in which high and
low are duly mingled, is called harmony; and both together are termed
choric song. and i said that the gods had pity on us, and gave us
apollo and the muses to be our playfellows and leaders in the dance; and
dionysus, as i dare say that you will remember, was the third.

cleinias: i quite remember.

athenian: thus far i have spoken of the chorus of apollo and the muses,
and i have still to speak of the remaining chorus, which is that of
dionysus.

cleinias: how is that arranged? there is something strange, at any rate
on first hearing, in a dionysiac chorus of old men, if you really mean
that those who are above thirty, and may be fifty, or from fifty to
sixty years of age, are to dance in his honour.

athenian: very true; and therefore it must be shown that there is good
reason for the proposal.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: are we agreed thus far?

cleinias: about what?

athenian: that every man and boy, slave and free, both sexes, and the
whole city, should never cease charming themselves with the strains of
which we have spoken; and that there should be every sort of change and
variation of them in order to take away the effect of sameness, so that
the singers may always receive pleasure from their hymns, and may never
weary of them?

cleinias: every one will agree.

athenian: where, then, will that best part of our city which, by reason
of age and intelligence, has the greatest influence, sing these fairest
of strains, which are to do so much good? shall we be so foolish as
to let them off who would give us the most beautiful and also the most
useful of songs?

cleinias: but, says the argument, we cannot let them off.

athenian: then how can we carry out our purpose with decorum? will this
be the way?

cleinias: what?

athenian: when a man is advancing in years, he is afraid and reluctant
to sing;--he has no pleasure in his own performances; and if compulsion
is used, he will be more and more ashamed, the older and more discreet
he grows;--is not this true?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: well, and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has to stand
up and sing in the theatre to a mixed audience?--and if moreover when he
is required to do so, like the other choirs who contend for prizes, and
have been trained under a singing master, he is pinched and hungry, he
will certainly have a feeling of shame and discomfort which will make
him very unwilling to exhibit.

cleinias: no doubt.

athenian: how, then, shall we reassure him, and get him to sing? shall
we begin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at all until they
are eighteen years of age; we will tell them that fire must not be
poured upon fire, whether in the body or in the soul, until they begin
to go to work--this is a precaution which has to be taken against the
excitableness of youth;--afterwards they may taste wine in moderation
up to the age of thirty, but while a man is young he should abstain
altogether from intoxication and from excess of wine; when, at length,
he has reached forty years, after dinner at a public mess, he may invite
not only the other gods, but dionysus above all, to the mystery and
festivity of the elder men, making use of the wine which he has given
men to lighten the sourness of old age; that in age we may renew our
youth, and forget our sorrows; and also in order that the nature of
the soul, like iron melted in the fire, may become softer and so more
impressible. in the first place, will not any one who is thus mellowed
be more ready and less ashamed to sing--i do not say before a large
audience, but before a moderate company; nor yet among strangers,
but among his familiars, and, as we have often said, to chant, and to
enchant?

cleinias: he will be far more ready.

athenian: there will be no impropriety in our using such a method of
persuading them to join with us in song.

cleinias: none at all.

athenian: and what strain will they sing, and what muse will they hymn?
the strain should clearly be one suitable to them.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and what strain is suitable for heroes? shall they sing a
choric strain?

cleinias: truly, stranger, we of crete and lacedaemon know no strain
other than that which we have learnt and been accustomed to sing in our
chorus.

athenian: i dare say; for you have never acquired the knowledge of the
most beautiful kind of song, in your military way of life, which is
modelled after the camp, and is not like that of dwellers in cities; and
you have your young men herding and feeding together like young colts.
no one takes his own individual colt and drags him away from his fellows
against his will, raging and foaming, and gives him a groom to attend
to him alone, and trains and rubs him down privately, and gives him the
qualities in education which will make him not only a good soldier, but
also a governor of a state and of cities. such an one, as we said at
first, would be a greater warrior than he of whom tyrtaeus sings; and
he would honour courage everywhere, but always as the fourth, and not as
the first part of virtue, either in individuals or states.

cleinias: once more, stranger, i must complain that you depreciate our
lawgivers.

athenian: not intentionally, if at all, my good friend; but whither
the argument leads, thither let us follow; for if there be indeed some
strain of song more beautiful than that of the choruses or the public
theatres, i should like to impart it to those who, as we say, are
ashamed of these, and want to have the best.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: when things have an accompanying charm, either the best
thing in them is this very charm, or there is some rightness or utility
possessed by them;--for example, i should say that eating and drinking,
and the use of food in general, have an accompanying charm which we call
pleasure; but that this rightness and utility is just the healthfulness
of the things served up to us, which is their true rightness.

cleinias: just so.

athenian: thus, too, i should say that learning has a certain
accompanying charm which is the pleasure; but that the right and the
profitable, the good and the noble, are qualities which the truth gives
to it.

cleinias: exactly.

athenian: and so in the imitative arts--if they succeed in making
likenesses, and are accompanied by pleasure, may not their works be said
to have a charm?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: but equal proportions, whether of quality or quantity, and not
pleasure, speaking generally, would give them truth or rightness.

cleinias: yes.

athenian: then that only can be rightly judged by the standard of
pleasure, which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or likeness,
nor on the other hand is productive of any hurtful quality, but exists
solely for the sake of the accompanying charm; and the term 'pleasure'
is most appropriately applied to it when these other qualities are
absent.

cleinias: you are speaking of harmless pleasure, are you not?

athenian: yes; and this i term amusement, when doing neither harm nor
good in any degree worth speaking of.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: then, if such be our principles, we must assert that imitation
is not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion; and this is
true of all equality, for the equal is not equal or the symmetrical
symmetrical, because somebody thinks or likes something, but they are to
be judged of by the standard of truth, and by no other whatever.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: do we not regard all music as representative and imitative?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: then, when any one says that music is to be judged of by
pleasure, his doctrine cannot be admitted; and if there be any music of
which pleasure is the criterion, such music is not to be sought out or
deemed to have any real excellence, but only that other kind of music
which is an imitation of the good.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and those who seek for the best kind of song and music ought
not to seek for that which is pleasant, but for that which is true; and
the truth of imitation consists, as we were saying, in rendering the
thing imitated according to quantity and quality.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and every one will admit that musical compositions are all
imitative and representative. will not poets and spectators and actors
all agree in this?

cleinias: they will.

athenian: surely then he who would judge correctly must know what
each composition is; for if he does not know what is the character and
meaning of the piece, and what it represents, he will never discern
whether the intention is true or false.

cleinias: certainly not.

athenian: and will he who does not know what is true be able to
distinguish what is good and bad? my statement is not very clear; but
perhaps you will understand me better if i put the matter in another
way.

cleinias: how?

athenian: there are ten thousand likenesses of objects of sight?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: and can he who does not know what the exact object is which
is imitated, ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully executed?
i mean, for example, whether a statue has the proportions of a body, and
the true situation of the parts; what those proportions are, and how
the parts fit into one another in due order; also their colours and
conformations, or whether this is all confused in the execution: do
you think that any one can know about this, who does not know what the
animal is which has been imitated?

cleinias: impossible.

athenian: but even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured is a
man, who has received at the hand of the artist all his proper parts and
colours and shapes, must we not also know whether the work is beautiful
or in any respect deficient in beauty?

cleinias: if this were not required, stranger, we should all of us be
judges of beauty.

athenian: very true; and may we not say that in everything imitated,
whether in drawing, music, or any other art, he who is to be a competent
judge must possess three things;--he must know, in the first place,
of what the imitation is; secondly, he must know that it is true;
and thirdly, that it has been well executed in words and melodies and
rhythms?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficulty
of music. music is more celebrated than any other kind of imitation, and
therefore requires the greatest care of them all. for if a man makes a
mistake here, he may do himself the greatest injury by welcoming evil
dispositions, and the mistake may be very difficult to discern,
because the poets are artists very inferior in character to the muses
themselves, who would never fall into the monstrous error of assigning
to the words of men the gestures and songs of women; nor after combining
the melodies with the gestures of freemen would they add on the rhythms
of slaves and men of the baser sort; nor, beginning with the rhythms and
gestures of freemen, would they assign to them a melody or words which
are of an opposite character; nor would they mix up the voices and
sounds of animals and of men and instruments, and every other sort of
noise, as if they were all one. but human poets are fond of introducing
this sort of inconsistent mixture, and so make themselves ridiculous in
the eyes of those who, as orpheus says, 'are ripe for true pleasure.'
the experienced see all this confusion, and yet the poets go on and make
still further havoc by separating the rhythm and the figure of the dance
from the melody, setting bare words to metre, and also separating the
melody and the rhythm from the words, using the lyre or the flute alone.
for when there are no words, it is very difficult to recognize the
meaning of the harmony and rhythm, or to see that any worthy object is
imitated by them. and we must acknowledge that all this sort of thing,
which aims only at swiftness and smoothness and a brutish noise, and
uses the flute and the lyre not as the mere accompaniments of the
dance and song, is exceedingly coarse and tasteless. the use of either
instrument, when unaccompanied, leads to every sort of irregularity and
trickery. this is all rational enough. but we are considering not how
our choristers, who are from thirty to fifty years of age, and may be
over fifty, are not to use the muses, but how they are to use them. and
the considerations which we have urged seem to show in what way these
fifty years' old choristers who are to sing, may be expected to be
better trained. for they need to have a quick perception and knowledge
of harmonies and rhythms; otherwise, how can they ever know whether a
melody would be rightly sung to the dorian mode, or to the rhythm which
the poet has assigned to it?

cleinias: clearly they cannot.

athenian: the many are ridiculous in imagining that they know what is in
proper harmony and rhythm, and what is not, when they can only be made
to sing and step in rhythm by force; it never occurs to them that they
are ignorant of what they are doing. now every melody is right when it
has suitable harmony and rhythm, and wrong when unsuitable.

cleinias: that is most certain.

athenian: but can a man who does not know a thing, as we were saying,
know that the thing is right?

cleinias: impossible.

athenian: then now, as would appear, we are making the discovery that
our newly-appointed choristers, whom we hereby invite and, although
they are their own masters, compel to sing, must be educated to such an
extent as to be able to follow the steps of the rhythm and the notes of
the song, that they may know the harmonies and rhythms, and be able to
select what are suitable for men of their age and character to sing; and
may sing them, and have innocent pleasure from their own performance,
and also lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delight good
dispositions. having such training, they will attain a more accurate
knowledge than falls to the lot of the common people, or even of the
poets themselves. for the poet need not know the third point, viz.,
whether the imitation is good or not, though he can hardly help knowing
the laws of melody and rhythm. but the aged chorus must know all the
three, that they may choose the best, and that which is nearest to the
best; for otherwise they will never be able to charm the souls of young
men in the way of virtue. and now the original design of the argument
which was intended to bring eloquent aid to the chorus of dionysus, has
been accomplished to the best of our ability, and let us see whether
we were right:--i should imagine that a drinking assembly is likely to
become more and more tumultuous as the drinking goes on: this, as we
were saying at first, will certainly be the case.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: every man has a more than natural elevation; his heart is glad
within him, and he will say anything and will be restrained by nobody
at such a time; he fancies that he is able to rule over himself and all
mankind.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: were we not saying that on such occasions the souls of the
drinkers become like iron heated in the fire, and grow softer and
younger, and are easily moulded by him who knows how to educate and
fashion them, just as when they were young, and that this fashioner of
them is the same who prescribed for them in the days of their youth,
viz., the good legislator; and that he ought to enact laws of the
banquet, which, when a man is confident, bold, and impudent, and
unwilling to wait his turn and have his share of silence and speech, and
drinking and music, will change his character into the opposite--such
laws as will infuse into him a just and noble fear, which will take up
arms at the approach of insolence, being that divine fear which we have
called reverence and shame?

cleinias: true.

athenian: and the guardians of these laws and fellow-workers with them
are the calm and sober generals of the drinkers; and without their help
there is greater difficulty in fighting against drink than in fighting
against enemies when the commander of an army is not himself calm; and
he who is unwilling to obey them and the commanders of dionysiac feasts
who are more than sixty years of age, shall suffer a disgrace as great
as he who disobeys military leaders, or even greater.

cleinias: right.

athenian: if, then, drinking and amusement were regulated in this way,
would not the companions of our revels be improved? they would part
better friends than they were, and not, as now, enemies. their whole
intercourse would be regulated by law and observant of it, and the sober
would be the leaders of the drunken.

cleinias: i think so too, if drinking were regulated as you propose.

athenian: let us not then simply censure the gift of dionysus as bad and
unfit to be received into the state. for wine has many excellences, and
one pre-eminent one, about which there is a difficulty in speaking to
the many, from a fear of their misconceiving and misunderstanding what
is said.

cleinias: to what do you refer?

athenian: there is a tradition or story, which has somehow crept about
the world, that dionysus was robbed of his wits by his stepmother here,
and that out of revenge he inspires bacchic furies and dancing madnesses
in others; for which reason he gave men wine. such traditions concerning
the gods i leave to those who think that they may be safely uttered
(compare euthyph.; republic); i only know that no animal at birth is
mature or perfect in intelligence; and in the intermediate period, in
which he has not yet acquired his own proper sense, he rages and roars
without rhyme or reason; and when he has once got on his legs he jumps
about without rhyme or reason; and this, as you will remember, has been
already said by us to be the origin of music and gymnastic.

cleinias: to be sure, i remember.

athenian: and did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythm
sprang from this beginning among men, and that apollo and the muses and
dionysus were the gods whom we had to thank for them?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: the other story implied that wine was given man out of
revenge, and in order to make him mad; but our present doctrine, on the
contrary, is, that wine was given him as a balm, and in order to implant
modesty in the soul, and health and strength in the body.

cleinias: that, stranger, is precisely what was said.

athenian: then half the subject may now be considered to have been
discussed; shall we proceed to the consideration of the other half?

cleinias: what is the other half, and how do you divide the subject?

athenian: the whole choral art is also in our view the whole of
education; and of this art, rhythms and harmonies form the part which
has to do with the voice.

cleinias: yes.

athenian: the movement of the body has rhythm in common with the
movement of the voice, but gesture is peculiar to it, whereas song is
simply the movement of the voice.

cleinias: most true.

athenian: and the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the
soul, we have ventured to term music.

cleinias: we were right.

athenian: and the movement of the body, when regarded as an amusement,
we termed dancing; but when extended and pursued with a view to
the excellence of the body, this scientific training may be called
gymnastic.

cleinias: exactly.

athenian: music, which was one half of the choral art, may be said to
have been completely discussed. shall we proceed to the other half or
not? what would you like?

cleinias: my good friend, when you are talking with a cretan and
lacedaemonian, and we have discussed music and not gymnastic, what
answer are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry?

athenian: an answer is contained in your question; and i understand
and accept what you say not only as an answer, but also as a command to
proceed with gymnastic.

cleinias: you quite understand me; do as you say.

athenian: i will; and there will not be any difficulty in speaking
intelligibly to you about a subject with which both of you are far more
familiar than with music.

cleinias: there will not.

athenian: is not the origin of gymnastics, too, to be sought in the
tendency to rapid motion which exists in all animals; man, as we were
saying, having attained the sense of rhythm, created and invented
dancing; and melody arousing and awakening rhythm, both united formed
the choral art?

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and one part of this subject has been already discussed by us,
and there still remains another to be discussed?

cleinias: exactly.

athenian: i have first a final word to add to my discourse about drink,
if you will allow me to do so.

cleinias: what more have you to say?

athenian: i should say that if a city seriously means to adopt the
practice of drinking under due regulation and with a view to the
enforcement of temperance, and in like manner, and on the same
principle, will allow of other pleasures, designing to gain the victory
over them--in this way all of them may be used. but if the state makes
drinking an amusement only, and whoever likes may drink whenever he
likes, and with whom he likes, and add to this any other indulgences,
i shall never agree or allow that this city or this man should practise
drinking. i would go further than the cretans and lacedaemonians, and am
disposed rather to the law of the carthaginians, that no one while he is
on a campaign should be allowed to taste wine at all, but that he should
drink water during all that time, and that in the city no slave, male
or female, should ever drink wine; and that no magistrates should drink
during their year of office, nor should pilots of vessels or judges
while on duty taste wine at all, nor any one who is going to hold a
consultation about any matter of importance; nor in the day-time at all,
unless in consequence of exercise or as medicine; nor again at night,
when any one, either man or woman, is minded to get children. there are
numberless other cases also in which those who have good sense and good
laws ought not to drink wine, so that if what i say is true, no city
will need many vineyards. their husbandry and their way of life in
general will follow an appointed order, and their cultivation of the
vine will be the most limited and the least common of their employments.
and this, stranger, shall be the crown of my discourse about wine, if
you agree.

cleinias: excellent: we agree.




book iii.

athenian: enough of this. and what, then, is to be regarded as the
origin of government? will not a man be able to judge of it best from
a point of view in which he may behold the progress of states and their
transitions to good or evil?

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: i mean that he might watch them from the point of view of
time, and observe the changes which take place in them during infinite
ages.

cleinias: how so?

athenian: why, do you think that you can reckon the time which has
elapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens of them?

cleinias: hardly.

athenian: but are sure that it must be vast and incalculable?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and have not thousands and thousands of cities come into being
during this period and as many perished? and has not each of them
had every form of government many times over, now growing larger, now
smaller, and again improving or declining?

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: let us endeavour to ascertain the cause of these changes; for
that will probably explain the first origin and development of forms of
government.

cleinias: very good. you shall endeavour to impart your thoughts to us,
and we will make an effort to understand you.

athenian: do you believe that there is any truth in ancient traditions?

cleinias: what traditions?

athenian: the traditions about the many destructions of mankind which
have been occasioned by deluges and pestilences, and in many other ways,
and of the survival of a remnant?

cleinias: every one is disposed to believe them.

athenian: let us consider one of them, that which was caused by the
famous deluge.

cleinias: what are we to observe about it?

athenian: i mean to say that those who then escaped would only be hill
shepherds,--small sparks of the human race preserved on the tops of
mountains.

cleinias: clearly.

athenian: such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with the arts
and the various devices which are suggested to the dwellers in cities
by interest or ambition, and with all the wrongs which they contrive
against one another.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: let us suppose, then, that the cities in the plain and on the
sea-coast were utterly destroyed at that time.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: would not all implements have then perished and every other
excellent invention of political or any other sort of wisdom have
utterly disappeared?

cleinias: why, yes, my friend; and if things had always continued as
they are at present ordered, how could any discovery have ever been
made even in the least particular? for it is evident that the arts were
unknown during ten thousand times ten thousand years. and no more than
a thousand or two thousand years have elapsed since the discoveries of
daedalus, orpheus and palamedes,--since marsyas and olympus invented
music, and amphion the lyre--not to speak of numberless other inventions
which are but of yesterday.

athenian: have you forgotten, cleinias, the name of a friend who is
really of yesterday?

cleinias: i suppose that you mean epimenides.

athenian: the same, my friend; he does indeed far overleap the heads
of all mankind by his invention; for he carried out in practice, as you
declare, what of old hesiod (works and days) only preached.

cleinias: yes, according to our tradition.

athenian: after the great destruction, may we not suppose that the state
of man was something of this sort:--in the beginning of things there was
a fearful illimitable desert and a vast expanse of land; a herd or two
of oxen would be the only survivors of the animal world; and there might
be a few goats, these too hardly enough to maintain the shepherds who
tended them?

cleinias: true.

athenian: and of cities or governments or legislation, about which we
are now talking, do you suppose that they could have any recollection at
all?

cleinias: none whatever.

athenian: and out of this state of things has there not sprung all that
we now are and have: cities and governments, and arts and laws, and a
great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue?

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: why, my good friend, how can we possibly suppose that those
who knew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could have attained
their full development, whether of virtue or of vice?

cleinias: i understand your meaning, and you are quite right.

athenian: but, as time advanced and the race multiplied, the world came
to be what the world is.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: doubtless the change was not made all in a moment, but little
by little, during a very long period of time.

cleinias: a highly probable supposition.

athenian: at first, they would have a natural fear ringing in their ears
which would prevent their descending from the heights into the plain.

cleinias: of course.

athenian: the fewness of the survivors at that time would have made
them all the more desirous of seeing one another; but then the means of
travelling either by land or sea had been almost entirely lost, as i
may say, with the loss of the arts, and there was great difficulty in
getting at one another; for iron and brass and all metals were jumbled
together and had disappeared in the chaos; nor was there any possibility
of extracting ore from them; and they had scarcely any means of felling
timber. even if you suppose that some implements might have been
preserved in the mountains, they must quickly have worn out and
vanished, and there would be no more of them until the art of metallurgy
had again revived.

cleinias: there could not have been.

athenian: in how many generations would this be attained?

cleinias: clearly, not for many generations.

athenian: during this period, and for some time afterwards, all the arts
which require iron and brass and the like would disappear.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: faction and war would also have died out in those days, and
for many reasons.

cleinias: how would that be?

athenian: in the first place, the desolation of these primitive men
would create in them a feeling of affection and goodwill towards one
another; and, secondly, they would have no occasion to quarrel about
their subsistence, for they would have pasture in abundance, except just
at first, and in some particular cases; and from their pasture-land they
would obtain the greater part of their food in a primitive age, having
plenty of milk and flesh; moreover they would procure other food by the
chase, not to be despised either in quantity or quality. they would also
have abundance of clothing, and bedding, and dwellings, and utensils
either capable of standing on the fire or not; for the plastic and
weaving arts do not require any use of iron: and god has given these
two arts to man in order to provide him with all such things, that,
when reduced to the last extremity, the human race may still grow
and increase. hence in those days mankind were not very poor; nor was
poverty a cause of difference among them; and rich they could not have
been, having neither gold nor silver:--such at that time was their
condition. and the community which has neither poverty nor riches will
always have the noblest principles; in it there is no insolence or
injustice, nor, again, are there any contentions or envyings. and
therefore they were good, and also because they were what is called
simple-minded; and when they were told about good and evil, they in
their simplicity believed what they heard to be very truth and practised
it. no one had the wit to suspect another of a falsehood, as men do now;
but what they heard about gods and men they believed to be true, and
lived accordingly; and therefore they were in all respects such as we
have described them.

cleinias: that quite accords with my views, and with those of my friend
here.

athenian: would not many generations living on in a simple manner,
although ruder, perhaps, and more ignorant of the arts generally, and
in particular of those of land or naval warfare, and likewise of
other arts, termed in cities legal practices and party conflicts,
and including all conceivable ways of hurting one another in word and
deed;--although inferior to those who lived before the deluge, or to the
men of our day in these respects, would they not, i say, be simpler and
more manly, and also more temperate and altogether more just? the reason
has been already explained.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: i should wish you to understand that what has preceded and
what is about to follow, has been, and will be said, with the intention
of explaining what need the men of that time had of laws, and who was
their lawgiver.

cleinias: and thus far what you have said has been very well said.

athenian: they could hardly have wanted lawgivers as yet; nothing of
that sort was likely to have existed in their days, for they had no
letters at this early period; they lived by habit and the customs of
their ancestors, as they are called.

cleinias: probably.

athenian: but there was already existing a form of government which,
if i am not mistaken, is generally termed a lordship, and this still
remains in many places, both among hellenes and barbarians (compare
arist. pol.), and is the government which is declared by homer to have
prevailed among the cyclopes:--

'they have neither councils nor judgments, but they dwell in hollow
caves on the tops of high mountains, and every one gives law to his
wife and children, and they do not busy themselves about one another.'
(odyss.)

cleinias: that seems to be a charming poet of yours; i have read some
other verses of his, which are very clever; but i do not know much of
him, for foreign poets are very little read among the cretans.

megillus: but they are in lacedaemon, and he appears to be the prince
of them all; the manner of life, however, which he describes is not
spartan, but rather ionian, and he seems quite to confirm what you are
saying, when he traces up the ancient state of mankind by the help of
tradition to barbarism.

athenian: yes, he does confirm it; and we may accept his witness to the
fact that such forms of government sometimes arise.

cleinias: we may.

athenian: and were not such states composed of men who had been
dispersed in single habitations and families by the poverty which
attended the devastations; and did not the eldest then rule among them,
because with them government originated in the authority of a father and
a mother, whom, like a flock of birds, they followed, forming one troop
under the patriarchal rule and sovereignty of their parents, which of
all sovereignties is the most just?

cleinias: very true.

athenian: after this they came together in greater numbers, and
increased the size of their cities, and betook themselves to husbandry,
first of all at the foot of the mountains, and made enclosures of loose
walls and works of defence, in order to keep off wild beasts; thus
creating a single large and common habitation.

cleinias: yes; at least we may suppose so.

athenian: there is another thing which would probably happen.

cleinias: what?

athenian: when these larger habitations grew up out of the lesser
original ones, each of the lesser ones would survive in the larger;
every family would be under the rule of the eldest, and, owing to their
separation from one another, would have peculiar customs in things
divine and human, which they would have received from their several
parents who had educated them; and these customs would incline them to
order, when the parents had the element of order in their nature, and to
courage, when they had the element of courage. and they would naturally
stamp upon their children, and upon their children's children, their
own likings; and, as we are saying, they would find their way into the
larger society, having already their own peculiar laws.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and every man surely likes his own laws best, and the laws of
others not so well.

cleinias: true.

athenian: then now we seem to have stumbled upon the beginnings of
legislation.

cleinias: exactly.

athenian: the next step will be that these persons who have met
together, will select some arbiters, who will review the laws of all of
them, and will publicly present such as they approve to the chiefs who
lead the tribes, and who are in a manner their kings, allowing them to
choose those which they think best. these persons will themselves be
called legislators, and will appoint the magistrates, framing some sort
of aristocracy, or perhaps monarchy, out of the dynasties or lordships,
and in this altered state of the government they will live.

cleinias: yes, that would be the natural order of things.

athenian: then, now let us speak of a third form of government, in which
all other forms and conditions of polities and cities concur.

cleinias: what is that?

athenian: the form which in fact homer indicates as following the
second. this third form arose when, as he says, dardanus founded
dardania:--

'for not as yet had the holy ilium been built on the plain to be a
city of speaking men; but they were still dwelling at the foot of
many-fountained ida.'

for indeed, in these verses, and in what he said of the cyclopes, he
speaks the words of god and nature; for poets are a divine race, and
often in their strains, by the aid of the muses and the graces, they
attain truth.

cleinias: yes.

athenian: then now let us proceed with the rest of our tale, which
will probably be found to illustrate in some degree our proposed
design:--shall we do so?

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: ilium was built, when they descended from the mountain, in
a large and fair plain, on a sort of low hill, watered by many rivers
descending from ida.

cleinias: such is the tradition.

athenian: and we must suppose this event to have taken place many ages
after the deluge?

athenian: a marvellous forgetfulness of the former destruction would
appear to have come over them, when they placed their town right under
numerous streams flowing from the heights, trusting for their security
to not very high hills, either.

cleinias: there must have been a long interval, clearly.

athenian: and, as population increased, many other cities would begin to
be inhabited.

cleinias: doubtless.

athenian: those cities made war against troy--by sea as well as
land--for at that time men were ceasing to be afraid of the sea.

cleinias: clearly.

athenian: the achaeans remained ten years, and overthrew troy.

cleinias: true.

athenian: and during the ten years in which the achaeans were besieging
ilium, the homes of the besiegers were falling into an evil plight.
their youth revolted; and when the soldiers returned to their own cities
and families, they did not receive them properly, and as they ought to
have done, and numerous deaths, murders, exiles, were the consequence.
the exiles came again, under a new name, no longer achaeans, but
dorians,--a name which they derived from dorieus; for it was he
who gathered them together. the rest of the story is told by you
lacedaemonians as part of the history of sparta.

megillus: to be sure.

athenian: thus, after digressing from the original subject of laws into
music and drinking-bouts, the argument has, providentially, come back to
the same point, and presents to us another handle. for we have reached
the settlement of lacedaemon; which, as you truly say, is in laws and
in institutions the sister of crete. and we are all the better for
the digression, because we have gone through various governments and
settlements, and have been present at the foundation of a first, second,
and third state, succeeding one another in infinite time. and now
there appears on the horizon a fourth state or nation which was once in
process of settlement and has continued settled to this day. if, out of
all this, we are able to discern what is well or ill settled, and what
laws are the salvation and what are the destruction of cities, and what
changes would make a state happy, o megillus and cleinias, we may
now begin again, unless we have some fault to find with the previous
discussion.

megillus: if some god, stranger, would promise us that our new enquiry
about legislation would be as good and full as the present, i would go
a great way to hear such another, and would think that a day as long as
this--and we are now approaching the longest day of the year--was too
short for the discussion.

athenian: then i suppose that we must consider this subject?

megillus: certainly.

athenian: let us place ourselves in thought at the moment when
lacedaemon and argos and messene and the rest of the peloponnesus were
all in complete subjection, megillus, to your ancestors; for afterwards,
as the legend informs us, they divided their army into three portions,
and settled three cities, argos, messene, lacedaemon.

megillus: true.

athenian: temenus was the king of argos, cresphontes of messene, procles
and eurysthenes of lacedaemon.

megillus: certainly.

athenian: to these kings all the men of that day made oath that they
would assist them, if any one subverted their kingdom.

megillus: true.

athenian: but can a kingship be destroyed, or was any other form of
government ever destroyed, by any but the rulers themselves? no indeed,
by zeus. have we already forgotten what was said a little while ago?

megillus: no.

athenian: and may we not now further confirm what was then mentioned?
for we have come upon facts which have brought us back again to the
same principle; so that, in resuming the discussion, we shall not
be enquiring about an empty theory, but about events which actually
happened. the case was as follows:--three royal heroes made oath to
three cities which were under a kingly government, and the cities to
the kings, that both rulers and subjects should govern and be governed
according to the laws which were common to all of them: the rulers
promised that as time and the race went forward they would not make
their rule more arbitrary; and the subjects said that, if the rulers
observed these conditions, they would never subvert or permit others to
subvert those kingdoms; the kings were to assist kings and peoples
when injured, and the peoples were to assist peoples and kings in like
manner. is not this the fact?

megillus: yes.

athenian: and the three states to whom these laws were given, whether
their kings or any others were the authors of them, had therefore the
greatest security for the maintenance of their constitutions?

megillus: what security?

athenian: that the other two states were always to come to the rescue
against a rebellious third.

megillus: true.

athenian: many persons say that legislators ought to impose such laws as
the mass of the people will be ready to receive; but this is just as
if one were to command gymnastic masters or physicians to treat or cure
their pupils or patients in an agreeable manner.

megillus: exactly.

athenian: whereas the physician may often be too happy if he can restore
health, and make the body whole, without any very great infliction of
pain.

megillus: certainly.

athenian: there was also another advantage possessed by the men of that
day, which greatly lightened the task of passing laws.

megillus: what advantage?

athenian: the legislators of that day, when they equalized property,
escaped the great accusation which generally arises in legislation, if a
person attempts to disturb the possession of land, or to abolish debts,
because he sees that without this reform there can never be any real
equality. now, in general, when the legislator attempts to make a new
settlement of such matters, every one meets him with the cry, that 'he
is not to disturb vested interests,'--declaring with imprecations that
he is introducing agrarian laws and cancelling of debts, until a man
is at his wits' end; whereas no one could quarrel with the dorians for
distributing the land,--there was nothing to hinder them; and as for
debts, they had none which were considerable or of old standing.

megillus: very true.

athenian: but then, my good friends, why did the settlement and
legislation of their country turn out so badly?

megillus: how do you mean; and why do you blame them?

athenian: there were three kingdoms, and of these, two quickly corrupted
their original constitution and laws, and the only one which remained
was the spartan.

megillus: the question which you ask is not easily answered.

athenian: and yet must be answered when we are enquiring about laws,
this being our old man's sober game of play, whereby we beguile the way,
as i was saying when we first set out on our journey.

megillus: certainly; and we must find out why this was.

athenian: what laws are more worthy of our attention than those which
have regulated such cities? or what settlements of states are greater or
more famous?

megillus: i know of none.

athenian: can we doubt that your ancestors intended these institutions
not only for the protection of peloponnesus, but of all the hellenes,
in case they were attacked by the barbarian? for the inhabitants of the
region about ilium, when they provoked by their insolence the trojan
war, relied upon the power of the assyrians and the empire of ninus,
which still existed and had a great prestige; the people of those days
fearing the united assyrian empire just as we now fear the great king.
and the second capture of troy was a serious offence against them,
because troy was a portion of the assyrian empire. to meet the danger
the single army was distributed between three cities by the royal
brothers, sons of heracles,--a fair device, as it seemed, and a far
better arrangement than the expedition against troy. for, firstly,
the people of that day had, as they thought, in the heraclidae better
leaders than the pelopidae; in the next place, they considered that
their army was superior in valour to that which went against troy;
for, although the latter conquered the trojans, they were themselves
conquered by the heraclidae--achaeans by dorians. may we not suppose
that this was the intention with which the men of those days framed the
constitutions of their states?

megillus: quite true.

athenian: and would not men who had shared with one another many
dangers, and were governed by a single race of royal brothers, and had
taken the advice of oracles, and in particular of the delphian apollo,
be likely to think that such states would be firmly and lastingly
established?

megillus: of course they would.

athenian: yet these institutions, of which such great expectations were
entertained, seem to have all rapidly vanished away; with the exception,
as i was saying, of that small part of them which existed in your land.
and this third part has never to this day ceased warring against the two
others; whereas, if the original idea had been carried out, and they had
agreed to be one, their power would have been invincible in war.

megillus: no doubt.

athenian: but what was the ruin of this glorious confederacy? here is a
subject well worthy of consideration.

megillus: certainly, no one will ever find more striking instances of
laws or governments being the salvation or destruction of great and
noble interests, than are here presented to his view.

athenian: then now we seem to have happily arrived at a real and
important question.

megillus: very true.

athenian: did you never remark, sage friend, that all men, and we
ourselves at this moment, often fancy that they see some beautiful thing
which might have effected wonders if any one had only known how to make
a right use of it in some way; and yet this mode of looking at things
may turn out after all to be a mistake, and not according to nature,
either in our own case or in any other?

megillus: to what are you referring, and what do you mean?

athenian: i was thinking of my own admiration of the aforesaid heracleid
expedition, which was so noble, and might have had such wonderful
results for the hellenes, if only rightly used; and i was just laughing
at myself.

megillus: but were you not right and wise in speaking as you did, and we
in assenting to you?

athenian: perhaps; and yet i cannot help observing that any one who sees
anything great or powerful, immediately has the feeling that--'if the
owner only knew how to use his great and noble possession, how happy
would he be, and what great results would he achieve!'

megillus: and would he not be justified?

athenian: reflect; in what point of view does this sort of praise
appear just: first, in reference to the question in hand:--if the then
commanders had known how to arrange their army properly, how would they
have attained success? would not this have been the way? they would have
bound them all firmly together and preserved them for ever, giving them
freedom and dominion at pleasure, combined with the power of doing
in the whole world, hellenic and barbarian, whatever they and their
descendants desired. what other aim would they have had?

megillus: very good.

athenian: suppose any one were in the same way to express his admiration
at the sight of great wealth or family honour, or the like, he would
praise them under the idea that through them he would attain either all
or the greater and chief part of what he desires.

megillus: he would.

athenian: well, now, and does not the argument show that there is one
common desire of all mankind?

megillus: what is it?

athenian: the desire which a man has, that all things, if possible,--at
any rate, things human,--may come to pass in accordance with his soul's
desire.

megillus: certainly.

athenian: and having this desire always, and at every time of life,
in youth, in manhood, in age, he cannot help always praying for the
fulfilment of it.

megillus: no doubt.

athenian: and we join in the prayers of our friends, and ask for them
what they ask for themselves.

megillus: we do.

athenian: dear is the son to the father--the younger to the elder.

megillus: of course.

athenian: and yet the son often prays to obtain things which the father
prays that he may not obtain.

megillus: when the son is young and foolish, you mean?

athenian: yes; or when the father, in the dotage of age or the heat of
youth, having no sense of right and justice, prays with fervour, under
the influence of feelings akin to those of theseus when he cursed the
unfortunate hippolytus, do you imagine that the son, having a sense of
right and justice, will join in his father's prayers?

megillus: i understand you to mean that a man should not desire or be in
a hurry to have all things according to his wish, for his wish may be at
variance with his reason. but every state and every individual ought to
pray and strive for wisdom.

athenian: yes; and i remember, and you will remember, what i said at
first, that a statesman and legislator ought to ordain laws with a view
to wisdom; while you were arguing that the good lawgiver ought to order
all with a view to war. and to this i replied that there were four
virtues, but that upon your view one of them only was the aim of
legislation; whereas you ought to regard all virtue, and especially that
which comes first, and is the leader of all the rest--i mean wisdom and
mind and opinion, having affection and desire in their train. and now
the argument returns to the same point, and i say once more, in jest if
you like, or in earnest if you like, that the prayer of a fool is full
of danger, being likely to end in the opposite of what he desires. and
if you would rather receive my words in earnest, i am willing that you
should; and you will find, i suspect, as i have said already, that not
cowardice was the cause of the ruin of the dorian kings and of their
whole design, nor ignorance of military matters, either on the part of
the rulers or of their subjects; but their misfortunes were due to
their general degeneracy, and especially to their ignorance of the most
important human affairs. that was then, and is still, and always will
be the case, as i will endeavour, if you will allow me, to make out
and demonstrate as well as i am able to you who are my friends, in the
course of the argument.

cleinias: pray go on, stranger;--compliments are troublesome, but we
will show, not in word but in deed, how greatly we prize your words,
for we will give them our best attention; and that is the way in which a
freeman best shows his approval or disapproval.

megillus: excellent, cleinias; let us do as you say.

cleinias: by all means, if heaven wills. go on.

athenian: well, then, proceeding in the same train of thought, i say
that the greatest ignorance was the ruin of the dorian power, and that
now, as then, ignorance is ruin. and if this be true, the legislator
must endeavour to implant wisdom in states, and banish ignorance to the
utmost of his power.

cleinias: that is evident.

athenian: then now consider what is really the greatest ignorance. i
should like to know whether you and megillus would agree with me in what
i am about to say; for my opinion is--

cleinias: what?

athenian: that the greatest ignorance is when a man hates that which he
nevertheless thinks to be good and noble, and loves and embraces that
which he knows to be unrighteous and evil. this disagreement between
the sense of pleasure and the judgment of reason in the soul is, in my
opinion, the worst ignorance; and also the greatest, because affecting
the great mass of the human soul; for the principle which feels pleasure
and pain in the individual is like the mass or populace in a state. and
when the soul is opposed to knowledge, or opinion, or reason, which are
her natural lords, that i call folly, just as in the state, when the
multitude refuses to obey their rulers and the laws; or, again, in the
individual, when fair reasonings have their habitation in the soul and
yet do no good, but rather the reverse of good. all these cases i term
the worst ignorance, whether in individuals or in states. you will
understand, stranger, that i am speaking of something which is very
different from the ignorance of handicraftsmen.

cleinias: yes, my friend, we understand and agree.

athenian: let us, then, in the first place declare and affirm that the
citizen who does not know these things ought never to have any kind of
authority entrusted to him: he must be stigmatized as ignorant,
even though he be versed in calculation and skilled in all sorts of
accomplishments, and feats of mental dexterity; and the opposite are to
be called wise, even although, in the words of the proverb, they know
neither how to read nor how to swim; and to them, as to men of sense,
authority is to be committed. for, o my friends, how can there be the
least shadow of wisdom when there is no harmony? there is none; but the
noblest and greatest of harmonies may be truly said to be the greatest
wisdom; and of this he is a partaker who lives according to reason;
whereas he who is devoid of reason is the destroyer of his house and
the very opposite of a saviour of the state: he is utterly ignorant of
political wisdom. let this, then, as i was saying, be laid down by us.

cleinias: let it be so laid down.

athenian: i suppose that there must be rulers and subjects in states?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and what are the principles on which men rule and obey in
cities, whether great or small; and similarly in families? what are
they, and how many in number? is there not one claim of authority
which is always just,--that of fathers and mothers and in general of
progenitors to rule over their offspring?

cleinias: there is.

athenian: next follows the principle that the noble should rule over the
ignoble; and, thirdly, that the elder should rule and the younger obey?

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: and, fourthly, that slaves should be ruled, and their masters
rule?

cleinias: of course.

athenian: fifthly, if i am not mistaken, comes the principle that the
stronger shall rule, and the weaker be ruled?

cleinias: that is a rule not to be disobeyed.

athenian: yes, and a rule which prevails very widely among all
creatures, and is according to nature, as the theban poet pindar once
said; and the sixth principle, and the greatest of all, is, that the
wise should lead and command, and the ignorant follow and obey; and
yet, o thou most wise pindar, as i should reply him, this surely is not
contrary to nature, but according to nature, being the rule of law over
willing subjects, and not a rule of compulsion.

cleinias: most true.

athenian: there is a seventh kind of rule which is awarded by lot, and
is dear to the gods and a token of good fortune: he on whom the lot
falls is a ruler, and he who fails in obtaining the lot goes away and is
the subject; and this we affirm to be quite just.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: 'then now,' as we say playfully to any of those who lightly
undertake the making of laws, 'you see, legislator, the principles of
government, how many they are, and that they are naturally opposed to
each other. there we have discovered a fountain-head of seditions, to
which you must attend. and, first, we will ask you to consider with us,
how and in what respect the kings of argos and messene violated these
our maxims, and ruined themselves and the great and famous hellenic
power of the olden time. was it because they did not know how wisely
hesiod spoke when he said that the half is often more than the whole?
his meaning was, that when to take the whole would be dangerous, and to
take the half would be the safe and moderate course, then the moderate
or better was more than the immoderate or worse.'

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and may we suppose this immoderate spirit to be more fatal
when found among kings than when among peoples?

cleinias: the probability is that ignorance will be a disorder
especially prevalent among kings, because they lead a proud and
luxurious life.

athenian: is it not palpable that the chief aim of the kings of that
time was to get the better of the established laws, and that they were
not in harmony with the principles which they had agreed to observe
by word and oath? this want of harmony may have had the appearance
of wisdom, but was really, as we assert, the greatest ignorance, and
utterly overthrew the whole empire by dissonance and harsh discord.

cleinias: very likely.

athenian: good; and what measures ought the legislator to have then
taken in order to avert this calamity? truly there is no great wisdom
in knowing, and no great difficulty in telling, after the evil has
happened; but to have foreseen the remedy at the time would have taken a
much wiser head than ours.

megillus: what do you mean?

athenian: any one who looks at what has occurred with you
lacedaemonians, megillus, may easily know and may easily say what ought
to have been done at that time.

megillus: speak a little more clearly.

athenian: nothing can be clearer than the observation which i am about
to make.

megillus: what is it?

athenian: that if any one gives too great a power to anything, too large
a sail to a vessel, too much food to the body, too much authority to the
mind, and does not observe the mean, everything is overthrown, and, in
the wantonness of excess, runs in the one case to disorders, and in the
other to injustice, which is the child of excess. i mean to say, my dear
friends, that there is no soul of man, young and irresponsible, who will
be able to sustain the temptation of arbitrary power--no one who will
not, under such circumstances, become filled with folly, that worst of
diseases, and be hated by his nearest and dearest friends: when this
happens his kingdom is undermined, and all his power vanishes from him.
and great legislators who know the mean should take heed of the danger.
as far as we can guess at this distance of time, what happened was as
follows:--

megillus: what?

athenian: a god, who watched over sparta, seeing into the future, gave
you two families of kings instead of one; and thus brought you more
within the limits of moderation. in the next place, some human wisdom
mingled with divine power, observing that the constitution of your
government was still feverish and excited, tempered your inborn strength
and pride of birth with the moderation which comes of age, making the
power of your twenty-eight elders equal with that of the kings in the
most important matters. but your third saviour, perceiving that your
government was still swelling and foaming, and desirous to impose a curb
upon it, instituted the ephors, whose power he made to resemble that of
magistrates elected by lot; and by this arrangement the kingly
office, being compounded of the right elements and duly moderated, was
preserved, and was the means of preserving all the rest. since, if there
had been only the original legislators, temenus, cresphontes, and their
contemporaries, as far as they were concerned not even the portion of
aristodemus would have been preserved; for they had no proper experience
in legislation, or they would surely not have imagined that oaths
would moderate a youthful spirit invested with a power which might be
converted into a tyranny. now that god has instructed us what sort of
government would have been or will be lasting, there is no wisdom, as i
have already said, in judging after the event; there is no difficulty
in learning from an example which has already occurred. but if any one
could have foreseen all this at the time, and had been able to moderate
the government of the three kingdoms and unite them into one, he might
have saved all the excellent institutions which were then conceived; and
no persian or any other armament would have dared to attack us, or would
have regarded hellas as a power to be despised.

cleinias: true.

athenian: there was small credit to us, cleinias, in defeating them;
and the discredit was, not that the conquerors did not win glorious
victories both by land and sea, but what, in my opinion, brought
discredit was, first of all, the circumstance that of the three cities
one only fought on behalf of hellas, and the two others were so
utterly good for nothing that the one was waging a mighty war against
lacedaemon, and was thus preventing her from rendering assistance,
while the city of argos, which had the precedence at the time of the
distribution, when asked to aid in repelling the barbarian, would not
answer to the call, or give aid. many things might be told about hellas
in connexion with that war which are far from honourable; nor, indeed,
can we rightly say that hellas repelled the invader; for the truth is,
that unless the athenians and lacedaemonians, acting in concert, had
warded off the impending yoke, all the tribes of hellas would have been
fused in a chaos of hellenes mingling with one another, of barbarians
mingling with hellenes, and hellenes with barbarians; just as nations
who are now subject to the persian power, owing to unnatural separations
and combinations of them, are dispersed and scattered, and live
miserably. these, cleinias and megillus, are the reproaches which we
have to make against statesmen and legislators, as they are called, past
and present, if we would analyse the causes of their failure, and find
out what else might have been done. we said, for instance, just now,
that there ought to be no great and unmixed powers; and this was under
the idea that a state ought to be free and wise and harmonious, and that
a legislator ought to legislate with a view to this end. nor is there
any reason to be surprised at our continually proposing aims for
the legislator which appear not to be always the same; but we should
consider when we say that temperance is to be the aim, or wisdom is
to be the aim, or friendship is to be the aim, that all these aims are
really the same; and if so, a variety in the modes of expression ought
not to disturb us.

cleinias: let us resume the argument in that spirit. and now, speaking
of friendship and wisdom and freedom, i wish that you would tell me at
what, in your opinion, the legislator should aim.

athenian: hear me, then: there are two mother forms of states from which
the rest may be truly said to be derived; and one of them may be called
monarchy and the other democracy: the persians have the highest form of
the one, and we of the other; almost all the rest, as i was saying, are
variations of these. now, if you are to have liberty and the combination
of friendship with wisdom, you must have both these forms of government
in a measure; the argument emphatically declares that no city can be
well governed which is not made up of both.

cleinias: impossible.

athenian: neither the one, if it be exclusively and excessively attached
to monarchy, nor the other, if it be similarly attached to freedom,
observes moderation; but your states, the laconian and cretan, have more
of it; and the same was the case with the athenians and persians of old
time, but now they have less. shall i tell you why?

cleinias: by all means, if it will tend to elucidate our subject.

athenian: hear, then:--there was a time when the persians had more of
the state which is a mean between slavery and freedom. in the reign of
cyrus they were freemen and also lords of many others: the rulers gave
a share of freedom to the subjects, and being treated as equals, the
soldiers were on better terms with their generals, and showed themselves
more ready in the hour of danger. and if there was any wise man among
them, who was able to give good counsel, he imparted his wisdom to the
public; for the king was not jealous, but allowed him full liberty of
speech, and gave honour to those who could advise him in any matter.
and the nation waxed in all respects, because there was freedom and
friendship and communion of mind among them.

cleinias: that certainly appears to have been the case.

athenian: how, then, was this advantage lost under cambyses, and again
recovered under darius? shall i try to divine?

cleinias: the enquiry, no doubt, has a bearing upon our subject.

athenian: i imagine that cyrus, though a great and patriotic general,
had never given his mind to education, and never attended to the order
of his household.

cleinias: what makes you say so?

athenian: i think that from his youth upwards he was a soldier, and
entrusted the education of his children to the women; and they brought
them up from their childhood as the favourites of fortune, who were
blessed already, and needed no more blessings. they thought that they
were happy enough, and that no one should be allowed to oppose them in
any way, and they compelled every one to praise all that they said or
did. this was how they brought them up.

cleinias: a splendid education truly!

athenian: such an one as women were likely to give them, and especially
princesses who had recently grown rich, and in the absence of the men,
too, who were occupied in wars and dangers, and had no time to look
after them.

cleinias: what would you expect?

athenian: their father had possessions of cattle and sheep, and many
herds of men and other animals, but he did not consider that those to
whom he was about to make them over were not trained in his own calling,
which was persian; for the persians are shepherds--sons of a rugged
land, which is a stern mother, and well fitted to produce a sturdy race
able to live in the open air and go without sleep, and also to fight, if
fighting is required (compare arist. pol.). he did not observe that his
sons were trained differently; through the so-called blessing of being
royal they were educated in the median fashion by women and eunuchs,
which led to their becoming such as people do become when they are
brought up unreproved. and so, after the death of cyrus, his sons, in
the fulness of luxury and licence, took the kingdom, and first one slew
the other because he could not endure a rival; and, afterwards, the
slayer himself, mad with wine and brutality, lost his kingdom through
the medes and the eunuch, as they called him, who despised the folly of
cambyses.

cleinias: so runs the tale, and such probably were the facts.

athenian: yes; and the tradition says, that the empire came back to the
persians, through darius and the seven chiefs.

cleinias: true.

athenian: let us note the rest of the story. observe, that darius was
not the son of a king, and had not received a luxurious education. when
he came to the throne, being one of the seven, he divided the country
into seven portions, and of this arrangement there are some shadowy
traces still remaining; he made laws upon the principle of introducing
universal equality in the order of the state, and he embodied in his
laws the settlement of the tribute which cyrus promised,--thus creating
a feeling of friendship and community among all the persians, and
attaching the people to him with money and gifts. hence his armies
cheerfully acquired for him countries as large as those which cyrus had
left behind him. darius was succeeded by his son xerxes; and he again
was brought up in the royal and luxurious fashion. might we not most
justly say: 'o darius, how came you to bring up xerxes in the same way
in which cyrus brought up cambyses, and not to see his fatal mistake?'
for xerxes, being the creation of the same education, met with much the
same fortune as cambyses; and from that time until now there has never
been a really great king among the persians, although they are all
called great. and their degeneracy is not to be attributed to chance, as
i maintain; the reason is rather the evil life which is generally led
by the sons of very rich and royal persons; for never will boy or man,
young or old, excel in virtue, who has been thus educated. and this,
i say, is what the legislator has to consider, and what at the present
moment has to be considered by us. justly may you, o lacedaemonians, be
praised, in that you do not give special honour or a special education
to wealth rather than to poverty, or to a royal rather than to a private
station, where the divine and inspired lawgiver has not originally
commanded them to be given. for no man ought to have pre-eminent honour
in a state because he surpasses others in wealth, any more than because
he is swift of foot or fair or strong, unless he have some virtue in
him; nor even if he have virtue, unless he have this particular virtue
of temperance.

megillus: what do you mean, stranger?

athenian: i suppose that courage is a part of virtue?

megillus: to be sure.

athenian: then, now hear and judge for yourself:--would you like to
have for a fellow-lodger or neighbour a very courageous man, who had no
control over himself?

megillus: heaven forbid!

athenian: or an artist, who was clever in his profession, but a rogue?

megillus: certainly not.

athenian: and surely justice does not grow apart from temperance?

megillus: impossible.

athenian: any more than our pattern wise man, whom we exhibited as
having his pleasures and pains in accordance with and corresponding to
true reason, can be intemperate?

megillus: no.

athenian: there is a further consideration relating to the due and undue
award of honours in states.

megillus: what is it?

athenian: i should like to know whether temperance without the other
virtues, existing alone in the soul of man, is rightly to be praised or
blamed?

megillus: i cannot tell.

athenian: and that is the best answer; for whichever alternative you had
chosen, i think that you would have gone wrong.

megillus: i am fortunate.

athenian: very good; a quality, which is a mere appendage of things
which can be praised or blamed, does not deserve an expression of
opinion, but is best passed over in silence.

megillus: you are speaking of temperance?

athenian: yes; but of the other virtues, that which having this
appendage is also most beneficial, will be most deserving of honour, and
next that which is beneficial in the next degree; and so each of them
will be rightly honoured according to a regular order.

megillus: true.

athenian: and ought not the legislator to determine these classes?

megillus: certainly he should.

athenian: suppose that we leave to him the arrangement of details. but
the general division of laws according to their importance into a first
and second and third class, we who are lovers of law may make ourselves.

megillus: very good.

athenian: we maintain, then, that a state which would be safe and happy,
as far as the nature of man allows, must and ought to distribute honour
and dishonour in the right way. and the right way is to place the goods
of the soul first and highest in the scale, always assuming temperance
to be the condition of them; and to assign the second place to the
goods of the body; and the third place to money and property. and if any
legislator or state departs from this rule by giving money the place of
honour, or in any way preferring that which is really last, may we not
say, that he or the state is doing an unholy and unpatriotic thing?

megillus: yes; let that be plainly declared.

athenian: the consideration of the persian governments led us thus far
to enlarge. we remarked that the persians grew worse and worse. and we
affirm the reason of this to have been, that they too much diminished
the freedom of the people, and introduced too much of despotism, and so
destroyed friendship and community of feeling. and when there is an end
of these, no longer do the governors govern on behalf of their subjects
or of the people, but on behalf of themselves; and if they think that
they can gain ever so small an advantage for themselves, they devastate
cities, and send fire and desolation among friendly races. and as they
hate ruthlessly and horribly, so are they hated; and when they want
the people to fight for them, they find no community of feeling or
willingness to risk their lives on their behalf; their untold myriads
are useless to them on the field of battle, and they think that their
salvation depends on the employment of mercenaries and strangers whom
they hire, as if they were in want of more men. and they cannot help
being stupid, since they proclaim by their actions that the ordinary
distinctions of right and wrong which are made in a state are a trifle,
when compared with gold and silver.

megillus: quite true.

athenian: and now enough of the persians, and their present
mal-administration of their government, which is owing to the excess of
slavery and despotism among them.

megillus: good.

athenian: next, we must pass in review the government of attica in like
manner, and from this show that entire freedom and the absence of all
superior authority is not by any means so good as government by others
when properly limited, which was our ancient athenian constitution at
the time when the persians made their attack on hellas, or, speaking
more correctly, on the whole continent of europe. there were four
classes, arranged according to a property census, and reverence was our
queen and mistress, and made us willing to live in obedience to the laws
which then prevailed. also the vastness of the persian armament, both by
sea and on land, caused a helpless terror, which made us more and more
the servants of our rulers and of the laws; and for all these reasons an
exceeding harmony prevailed among us. about ten years before the naval
engagement at salamis, datis came, leading a persian host by command
of darius, which was expressly directed against the athenians and
eretrians, having orders to carry them away captive; and these orders
he was to execute under pain of death. now datis and his myriads soon
became complete masters of eretria, and he sent a fearful report to
athens that no eretrian had escaped him; for the soldiers of datis had
joined hands and netted the whole of eretria. and this report, whether
well or ill founded, was terrible to all the hellenes, and above all to
the athenians, and they dispatched embassies in all directions, but
no one was willing to come to their relief, with the exception of the
lacedaemonians; and they, either because they were detained by the
messenian war, which was then going on, or for some other reason of
which we are not told, came a day too late for the battle of marathon.
after a while, the news arrived of mighty preparations being made, and
innumerable threats came from the king. then, as time went on, a rumour
reached us that darius had died, and that his son, who was young and
hot-headed, had come to the throne and was persisting in his design.
the athenians were under the impression that the whole expedition was
directed against them, in consequence of the battle of marathon; and
hearing of the bridge over the hellespont, and the canal of athos, and
the host of ships, considering that there was no salvation for them
either by land or by sea, for there was no one to help them, and
remembering that in the first expedition, when the persians destroyed
eretria, no one came to their help, or would risk the danger of an
alliance with them, they thought that this would happen again, at least
on land; nor, when they looked to the sea, could they descry any hope
of salvation; for they were attacked by a thousand vessels and more. one
chance of safety remained, slight indeed and desperate, but their only
one. they saw that on the former occasion they had gained a seemingly
impossible victory, and borne up by this hope, they found that their
only refuge was in themselves and in the gods. all these things created
in them the spirit of friendship; there was the fear of the moment,
and there was that higher fear, which they had acquired by obedience
to their ancient laws, and which i have several times in the preceding
discourse called reverence, of which the good man ought to be a willing
servant, and of which the coward is independent and fearless. if this
fear had not possessed them, they would never have met the enemy, or
defended their temples and sepulchres and their country, and everything
that was near and dear to them, as they did; but little by little they
would have been all scattered and dispersed.

megillus: your words, athenian, are quite true, and worthy of yourself
and of your country.

athenian: they are true, megillus; and to you, who have inherited the
virtues of your ancestors, i may properly speak of the actions of that
day. and i would wish you and cleinias to consider whether my words have
not also a bearing on legislation; for i am not discoursing only for the
pleasure of talking, but for the argument's sake. please to remark that
the experience both of ourselves and the persians was, in a certain
sense, the same; for as they led their people into utter servitude, so
we too led ours into all freedom. and now, how shall we proceed? for i
would like you to observe that our previous arguments have good deal to
say for themselves.

megillus: true; but i wish that you would give us a fuller explanation.

athenian: i will. under the ancient laws, my friends, the people was not
as now the master, but rather the willing servant of the laws.

megillus: what laws do you mean?

athenian: in the first place, let us speak of the laws about
music,--that is to say, such music as then existed--in order that we may
trace the growth of the excess of freedom from the beginning. now music
was early divided among us into certain kinds and manners. one sort
consisted of prayers to the gods, which were called hymns; and there
was another and opposite sort called lamentations, and another termed
paeans, and another, celebrating the birth of dionysus, called, i
believe, 'dithyrambs.' and they used the actual word 'laws,' or nomoi,
for another kind of song; and to this they added the term 'citharoedic.'
all these and others were duly distinguished, nor were the performers
allowed to confuse one style of music with another. and the authority
which determined and gave judgment, and punished the disobedient,
was not expressed in a hiss, nor in the most unmusical shouts of the
multitude, as in our days, nor in applause and clapping of hands. but
the directors of public instruction insisted that the spectators
should listen in silence to the end; and boys and their tutors, and the
multitude in general, were kept quiet by a hint from a stick. such was
the good order which the multitude were willing to observe; they would
never have dared to give judgment by noisy cries. and then, as time
went on, the poets themselves introduced the reign of vulgar and lawless
innovation. they were men of genius, but they had no perception of what
is just and lawful in music; raging like bacchanals and possessed with
inordinate delights--mingling lamentations with hymns, and paeans with
dithyrambs; imitating the sounds of the flute on the lyre, and making
one general confusion; ignorantly affirming that music has no truth,
and, whether good or bad, can only be judged of rightly by the pleasure
of the hearer (compare republic). and by composing such licentious
works, and adding to them words as licentious, they have inspired the
multitude with lawlessness and boldness, and made them fancy that they
can judge for themselves about melody and song. and in this way
the theatres from being mute have become vocal, as though they had
understanding of good and bad in music and poetry; and instead of an
aristocracy, an evil sort of theatrocracy has grown up (compare arist.
pol.). for if the democracy which judged had only consisted of educated
persons, no fatal harm would have been done; but in music there
first arose the universal conceit of omniscience and general
lawlessness;--freedom came following afterwards, and men, fancying
that they knew what they did not know, had no longer any fear, and the
absence of fear begets shamelessness. for what is this shamelessness,
which is so evil a thing, but the insolent refusal to regard the opinion
of the better by reason of an over-daring sort of liberty?

megillus: very true.

athenian: consequent upon this freedom comes the other freedom, of
disobedience to rulers (compare republic); and then the attempt to
escape the control and exhortation of father, mother, elders, and when
near the end, the control of the laws also; and at the very end there
is the contempt of oaths and pledges, and no regard at all for the
gods,--herein they exhibit and imitate the old so-called titanic nature,
and come to the same point as the titans when they rebelled against god,
leading a life of endless evils. but why have i said all this? i ask,
because the argument ought to be pulled up from time to time, and not
be allowed to run away, but held with bit and bridle, and then we shall
not, as the proverb says, fall off our ass. let us then once more ask
the question, to what end has all this been said?

megillus: very good.

athenian: this, then, has been said for the sake--

megillus: of what?

athenian: we were maintaining that the lawgiver ought to have three
things in view: first, that the city for which he legislates should be
free; and secondly, be at unity with herself; and thirdly, should have
understanding;--these were our principles, were they not?

megillus: certainly.

athenian: with a view to this we selected two kinds of government,
the one the most despotic, and the other the most free; and now we are
considering which of them is the right form: we took a mean in both
cases, of despotism in the one, and of liberty in the other, and we saw
that in a mean they attained their perfection; but that when they were
carried to the extreme of either, slavery or licence, neither party were
the gainers.

megillus: very true.

athenian: and that was our reason for considering the settlement of
the dorian army, and of the city built by dardanus at the foot of the
mountains, and the removal of cities to the seashore, and of our mention
of the first men, who were the survivors of the deluge. and all that was
previously said about music and drinking, and what preceded, was said
with the view of seeing how a state might be best administered, and
how an individual might best order his own life. and now, megillus and
cleinias, how can we put to the proof the value of our words?

cleinias: stranger, i think that i see how a proof of their value may be
obtained. this discussion of ours appears to me to have been singularly
fortunate, and just what i at this moment want; most auspiciously have
you and my friend megillus come in my way. for i will tell you what
has happened to me; and i regard the coincidence as a sort of omen.
the greater part of crete is going to send out a colony, and they have
entrusted the management of the affair to the cnosians; and the cnosian
government to me and nine others. and they desire us to give them any
laws which we please, whether taken from the cretan model or from
any other; and they do not mind about their being foreign if they
are better. grant me then this favour, which will also be a gain to
yourselves:--let us make a selection from what has been said, and then
let us imagine a state of which we will suppose ourselves to be the
original founders. thus we shall proceed with our enquiry, and, at
the same time, i may have the use of the framework which you are
constructing, for the city which is in contemplation.

athenian: good news, cleinias; if megillus has no objection, you may be
sure that i will do all in my power to please you.

cleinias: thank you.

megillus: and so will i.

cleinias: excellent; and now let us begin to frame the state.




book iv.

athenian: and now, what will this city be? i do not mean to ask what is
or will hereafter be the name of the place; that may be determined
by the accident of locality or of the original settlement--a river or
fountain, or some local deity may give the sanction of a name to the
newly-founded city; but i do want to know what the situation is, whether
maritime or inland.

cleinias: i should imagine, stranger, that the city of which we are
speaking is about eighty stadia distant from the sea.

athenian: and are there harbours on the seaboard?

cleinias: excellent harbours, stranger; there could not be better.

athenian: alas! what a prospect! and is the surrounding country
productive, or in need of importations?

cleinias: hardly in need of anything.

athenian: and is there any neighbouring state?

cleinias: none whatever, and that is the reason for selecting the place;
in days of old, there was a migration of the inhabitants, and the region
has been deserted from time immemorial.

athenian: and has the place a fair proportion of hill, and plain, and
wood?

cleinias: like the rest of crete in that.

athenian: you mean to say that there is more rock than plain?

cleinias: exactly.

athenian: then there is some hope that your citizens may be virtuous:
had you been on the sea, and well provided with harbours, and an
importing rather than a producing country, some mighty saviour would
have been needed, and lawgivers more than mortal, if you were ever to
have a chance of preserving your state from degeneracy and discordance
of manners (compare ar. pol.). but there is comfort in the eighty
stadia; although the sea is too near, especially if, as you say, the
harbours are so good. still we may be content. the sea is pleasant
enough as a daily companion, but has indeed also a bitter and brackish
quality; filling the streets with merchants and shopkeepers, and
begetting in the souls of men uncertain and unfaithful ways--making the
state unfriendly and unfaithful both to her own citizens, and also
to other nations. there is a consolation, therefore, in the country
producing all things at home; and yet, owing to the ruggedness of
the soil, not providing anything in great abundance. had there been
abundance, there might have been a great export trade, and a great
return of gold and silver; which, as we may safely affirm, has the most
fatal results on a state whose aim is the attainment of just and noble
sentiments: this was said by us, if you remember, in the previous
discussion.

cleinias: i remember, and am of opinion that we both were and are in the
right.

athenian: well, but let me ask, how is the country supplied with timber
for ship-building?

cleinias: there is no fir of any consequence, nor pine, and not much
cypress; and you will find very little stone-pine or plane-wood, which
shipwrights always require for the interior of ships.

athenian: these are also natural advantages.

cleinias: why so?

athenian: because no city ought to be easily able to imitate its enemies
in what is mischievous.

cleinias: how does that bear upon any of the matters of which we have
been speaking?

athenian: remember, my good friend, what i said at first about the
cretan laws, that they looked to one thing only, and this, as you both
agreed, was war; and i replied that such laws, in so far as they tended
to promote virtue, were good; but in that they regarded a part only, and
not the whole of virtue, i disapproved of them. and now i hope that
you in your turn will follow and watch me if i legislate with a view
to anything but virtue, or with a view to a part of virtue only. for i
consider that the true lawgiver, like an archer, aims only at that on
which some eternal beauty is always attending, and dismisses everything
else, whether wealth or any other benefit, when separated from virtue.
i was saying that the imitation of enemies was a bad thing; and i was
thinking of a case in which a maritime people are harassed by enemies,
as the athenians were by minos (i do not speak from any desire to recall
past grievances); but he, as we know, was a great naval potentate, who
compelled the inhabitants of attica to pay him a cruel tribute; and
in those days they had no ships of war as they now have, nor was the
country filled with ship-timber, and therefore they could not readily
build them. hence they could not learn how to imitate their enemy at
sea, and in this way, becoming sailors themselves, directly repel their
enemies. better for them to have lost many times over the seven youths,
than that heavy-armed and stationary troops should have been turned into
sailors, and accustomed to be often leaping on shore, and again to come
running back to their ships; or should have fancied that there was no
disgrace in not awaiting the attack of an enemy and dying boldly; and
that there were good reasons, and plenty of them, for a man throwing
away his arms, and betaking himself to flight,--which is not
dishonourable, as people say, at certain times. this is the language of
naval warfare, and is anything but worthy of extraordinary praise. for
we should not teach bad habits, least of all to the best part of the
citizens. you may learn the evil of such a practice from homer, by whom
odysseus is introduced, rebuking agamemnon, because he desires to draw
down the ships to the sea at a time when the achaeans are hard pressed
by the trojans,--he gets angry with him, and says:

'who, at a time when the battle is in full cry, biddest to drag the
well-benched ships into the sea, that the prayers of the trojans may be
accomplished yet more, and high ruin fall upon us. for the achaeans will
not maintain the battle, when the ships are drawn into the sea, but they
will look behind and will cease from strife; in that the counsel which
you give will prove injurious.'

you see that he quite knew triremes on the sea, in the neighbourhood of
fighting men, to be an evil;--lions might be trained in that way to fly
from a herd of deer. moreover, naval powers which owe their safety to
ships, do not give honour to that sort of warlike excellence which is
most deserving of it. for he who owes his safety to the pilot and the
captain, and the oarsman, and all sorts of rather inferior persons,
cannot rightly give honour to whom honour is due. but how can a state be
in a right condition which cannot justly award honour?

cleinias: it is hardly possible, i admit; and yet, stranger, we cretans
are in the habit of saying that the battle of salamis was the salvation
of hellas.

athenian: why, yes; and that is an opinion which is widely spread both
among hellenes and barbarians. but megillus and i say rather, that the
battle of marathon was the beginning, and the battle of plataea the
completion, of the great deliverance, and that these battles by
land made the hellenes better; whereas the sea-fights of salamis and
artemisium--for i may as well put them both together--made them no
better, if i may say so without offence about the battles which helped
to save us. and in estimating the goodness of a state, we regard both
the situation of the country and the order of the laws, considering that
the mere preservation and continuance of life is not the most honourable
thing for men, as the vulgar think, but the continuance of the best
life, while we live; and that again, if i am not mistaken, is a remark
which has been made already.

cleinias: yes.

athenian: then we have only to ask, whether we are taking the course
which we acknowledge to be the best for the settlement and legislation
of states.

cleinias: the best by far.

athenian: and now let me proceed to another question: who are to be the
colonists? may any one come out of all crete; and is the idea that
the population in the several states is too numerous for the means of
subsistence? for i suppose that you are not going to send out a general
invitation to any hellene who likes to come. and yet i observe that to
your country settlers have come from argos and aegina and other parts of
hellas. tell me, then, whence do you draw your recruits in the present
enterprise?

cleinias: they will come from all crete; and of other hellenes,
peloponnesians will be most acceptable. for, as you truly observe, there
are cretans of argive descent; and the race of cretans which has the
highest character at the present day is the gortynian, and this has come
from gortys in the peloponnesus.

athenian: cities find colonization in some respects easier if the
colonists are one race, which like a swarm of bees is sent out from
a single country, either when friends leave friends, owing to some
pressure of population or other similar necessity, or when a portion
of a state is driven by factions to emigrate. and there have been whole
cities which have taken flight when utterly conquered by a superior
power in war. this, however, which is in one way an advantage to the
colonist or legislator, in another point of view creates a difficulty.
there is an element of friendship in the community of race, and
language, and laws, and in common temples and rites of worship; but
colonies which are of this homogeneous sort are apt to kick against any
laws or any form of constitution differing from that which they had at
home; and although the badness of their own laws may have been the cause
of the factions which prevailed among them, yet from the force of habit
they would fain preserve the very customs which were their ruin, and the
leader of the colony, who is their legislator, finds them troublesome
and rebellious. on the other hand, the conflux of several populations
might be more disposed to listen to new laws; but then, to make them
combine and pull together, as they say of horses, is a most difficult
task, and the work of years. and yet there is nothing which tends more
to the improvement of mankind than legislation and colonization.

cleinias: no doubt; but i should like to know why you say so.

athenian: my good friend, i am afraid that the course of my speculations
is leading me to say something depreciatory of legislators; but if
the word be to the purpose, there can be no harm. and yet, why am i
disquieted, for i believe that the same principle applies equally to all
human things?

cleinias: to what are you referring?

athenian: i was going to say that man never legislates, but accidents of
all sorts, which legislate for us in all sorts of ways. the violence
of war and the hard necessity of poverty are constantly overturning
governments and changing laws. and the power of disease has often caused
innovations in the state, when there have been pestilences, or when
there has been a succession of bad seasons continuing during many years.
any one who sees all this, naturally rushes to the conclusion of which
i was speaking, that no mortal legislates in anything, but that in human
affairs chance is almost everything. and this may be said of the arts of
the sailor, and the pilot, and the physician, and the general, and may
seem to be well said; and yet there is another thing which may be said
with equal truth of all of them.

cleinias: what is it?

athenian: that god governs all things, and that chance and opportunity
co-operate with him in the government of human affairs. there is,
however, a third and less extreme view, that art should be there also;
for i should say that in a storm there must surely be a great advantage
in having the aid of the pilot's art. you would agree?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: and does not a like principle apply to legislation as well
as to other things: even supposing all the conditions to be favourable
which are needed for the happiness of the state, yet the true legislator
must from time to time appear on the scene?

cleinias: most true.

athenian: in each case the artist would be able to pray rightly for
certain conditions, and if these were granted by fortune, he would then
only require to exercise his art?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and all the other artists just now mentioned, if they were
bidden to offer up each their special prayer, would do so?

cleinias: of course.

athenian: and the legislator would do likewise?

cleinias: i believe that he would.

athenian: 'come, legislator,' we will say to him; 'what are the
conditions which you require in a state before you can organize it?' how
ought he to answer this question? shall i give his answer?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: he will say--'give me a state which is governed by a tyrant,
and let the tyrant be young and have a good memory; let him be quick
at learning, and of a courageous and noble nature; let him have that
quality which, as i said before, is the inseparable companion of all the
other parts of virtue, if there is to be any good in them.'

cleinias: i suppose, megillus, that this companion virtue of which the
stranger speaks, must be temperance?

athenian: yes, cleinias, temperance in the vulgar sense; not that which
in the forced and exaggerated language of some philosophers is called
prudence, but that which is the natural gift of children and animals, of
whom some live continently and others incontinently, but when isolated,
was, as we said, hardly worth reckoning in the catalogue of goods. i
think that you must understand my meaning.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: then our tyrant must have this as well as the other qualities,
if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in the shortest time
the form of government which is most conducive to happiness; for there
neither is nor ever will be a better or speedier way of establishing a
polity than by a tyranny.

cleinias: by what possible arguments, stranger, can any man persuade
himself of such a monstrous doctrine?

athenian: there is surely no difficulty in seeing, cleinias, what is in
accordance with the order of nature?

cleinias: you would assume, as you say, a tyrant who was young,
temperate, quick at learning, having a good memory, courageous, of a
noble nature?

athenian: yes; and you must add fortunate; and his good fortune must be
that he is the contemporary of a great legislator, and that some happy
chance brings them together. when this has been accomplished, god has
done all that he ever does for a state which he desires to be eminently
prosperous; he has done second best for a state in which there are two
such rulers, and third best for a state in which there are three.
the difficulty increases with the increase, and diminishes with the
diminution of the number.

cleinias: you mean to say, i suppose, that the best government is
produced from a tyranny, and originates in a good lawgiver and an
orderly tyrant, and that the change from such a tyranny into a perfect
form of government takes place most easily; less easily when from an
oligarchy; and, in the third degree, from a democracy: is not that your
meaning?

athenian: not so; i mean rather to say that the change is best made out
of a tyranny; and secondly, out of a monarchy; and thirdly, out of
some sort of democracy: fourth, in the capacity for improvement, comes
oligarchy, which has the greatest difficulty in admitting of such
a change, because the government is in the hands of a number of
potentates. i am supposing that the legislator is by nature of the true
sort, and that his strength is united with that of the chief men of the
state; and when the ruling element is numerically small, and at the
same time very strong, as in a tyranny, there the change is likely to be
easiest and most rapid.

cleinias: how? i do not understand.

athenian: and yet i have repeated what i am saying a good many times;
but i suppose that you have never seen a city which is under a tyranny?

cleinias: no, and i cannot say that i have any great desire to see one.

athenian: and yet, where there is a tyranny, you might certainly see
that of which i am now speaking.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: i mean that you might see how, without trouble and in no very
long period of time, the tyrant, if he wishes, can change the manners
of a state: he has only to go in the direction of virtue or of vice,
whichever he prefers, he himself indicating by his example the lines of
conduct, praising and rewarding some actions and reproving others, and
degrading those who disobey.

cleinias: but how can we imagine that the citizens in general will at
once follow the example set to them; and how can he have this power both
of persuading and of compelling them?

athenian: let no one, my friends, persuade us that there is any quicker
and easier way in which states change their laws than when the rulers
lead: such changes never have, nor ever will, come to pass in any other
way. the real impossibility or difficulty is of another sort, and is
rarely surmounted in the course of ages; but when once it is surmounted,
ten thousand or rather all blessings follow.

cleinias: of what are you speaking?

athenian: the difficulty is to find the divine love of temperate and
just institutions existing in any powerful forms of government, whether
in a monarchy or oligarchy of wealth or of birth. you might as well hope
to reproduce the character of nestor, who is said to have excelled
all men in the power of speech, and yet more in his temperance. this,
however, according to the tradition, was in the times of troy; in our
own days there is nothing of the sort; but if such an one either has
or ever shall come into being, or is now among us, blessed is he and
blessed are they who hear the wise words that flow from his lips. and
this may be said of power in general: when the supreme power in man
coincides with the greatest wisdom and temperance, then the best laws
and the best constitution come into being; but in no other way. and
let what i have been saying be regarded as a kind of sacred legend or
oracle, and let this be our proof that, in one point of view, there may
be a difficulty for a city to have good laws, but that there is another
point of view in which nothing can be easier or sooner effected,
granting our supposition.

cleinias: how do you mean?

athenian: let us try to amuse ourselves, old boys as we are, by moulding
in words the laws which are suitable to your state.

cleinias: let us proceed without delay.

athenian: then let us invoke god at the settlement of our state; may he
hear and be propitious to us, and come and set in order the state and
the laws!

cleinias: may he come!

athenian: but what form of polity are we going to give the city?

cleinias: tell us what you mean a little more clearly. do you mean some
form of democracy, or oligarchy, or aristocracy, or monarchy? for we
cannot suppose that you would include tyranny.

athenian: which of you will first tell me to which of these classes his
own government is to be referred?

megillus: ought i to answer first, since i am the elder?

cleinias: perhaps you should.

megillus: and yet, stranger, i perceive that i cannot say, without more
thought, what i should call the government of lacedaemon, for it seems
to me to be like a tyranny,--the power of our ephors is marvellously
tyrannical; and sometimes it appears to me to be of all cities the most
democratical; and who can reasonably deny that it is an aristocracy
(compare ar. pol.)? we have also a monarchy which is held for life,
and is said by all mankind, and not by ourselves only, to be the most
ancient of all monarchies; and, therefore, when asked on a sudden, i
cannot precisely say which form of government the spartan is.

cleinias: i am in the same difficulty, megillus; for i do not feel
confident that the polity of cnosus is any of these.

athenian: the reason is, my excellent friends, that you really have
polities, but the states of which we were just now speaking are merely
aggregations of men dwelling in cities who are the subjects and servants
of a part of their own state, and each of them is named after the
dominant power; they are not polities at all. but if states are to be
named after their rulers, the true state ought to be called by the name
of the god who rules over wise men.

cleinias: and who is this god?

athenian: may i still make use of fable to some extent, in the hope that
i may be better able to answer your question: shall i?

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: in the primeval world, and a long while before the cities came
into being whose settlements we have described, there is said to
have been in the time of cronos a blessed rule and life, of which the
best-ordered of existing states is a copy (compare statesman).

cleinias: it will be very necessary to hear about that.

athenian: i quite agree with you; and therefore i have introduced the
subject.

cleinias: most appropriately; and since the tale is to the point, you
will do well in giving us the whole story.

athenian: i will do as you suggest. there is a tradition of the happy
life of mankind in days when all things were spontaneous and abundant.
and of this the reason is said to have been as follows:--cronos knew
what we ourselves were declaring, that no human nature invested with
supreme power is able to order human affairs and not overflow with
insolence and wrong. which reflection led him to appoint not men but
demigods, who are of a higher and more divine race, to be the kings and
rulers of our cities; he did as we do with flocks of sheep and other
tame animals. for we do not appoint oxen to be the lords of oxen, or
goats of goats; but we ourselves are a superior race, and rule over
them. in like manner god, in his love of mankind, placed over us the
demons, who are a superior race, and they with great ease and pleasure
to themselves, and no less to us, taking care of us and giving us peace
and reverence and order and justice never failing, made the tribes of
men happy and united. and this tradition, which is true, declares that
cities of which some mortal man and not god is the ruler, have no escape
from evils and toils. still we must do all that we can to imitate the
life which is said to have existed in the days of cronos, and, as far as
the principle of immortality dwells in us, to that we must hearken, both
in private and public life, and regulate our cities and houses according
to law, meaning by the very term 'law,' the distribution of mind. but if
either a single person or an oligarchy or a democracy has a soul
eager after pleasures and desires--wanting to be filled with them, yet
retaining none of them, and perpetually afflicted with an endless and
insatiable disorder; and this evil spirit, having first trampled
the laws under foot, becomes the master either of a state or of an
individual,--then, as i was saying, salvation is hopeless. and now,
cleinias, we have to consider whether you will or will not accept this
tale of mine.

cleinias: certainly we will.

athenian: you are aware,--are you not?--that there are often said to be
as many forms of laws as there are of governments, and of the latter we
have already mentioned all those which are commonly recognized. now you
must regard this as a matter of first-rate importance. for what is to
be the standard of just and unjust, is once more the point at issue. men
say that the law ought not to regard either military virtue, or virtue
in general, but only the interests and power and preservation of the
established form of government; this is thought by them to be the best
way of expressing the natural definition of justice.

cleinias: how?

athenian: justice is said by them to be the interest of the stronger
(republic).

cleinias: speak plainer.

athenian: i will:--'surely,' they say, 'the governing power makes
whatever laws have authority in any state'?

cleinias: true.

athenian: 'well,' they would add, 'and do you suppose that tyranny or
democracy, or any other conquering power, does not make the continuance
of the power which is possessed by them the first or principal object of
their laws'?

cleinias: how can they have any other?

athenian: 'and whoever transgresses these laws is punished as an
evil-doer by the legislator, who calls the laws just'?

cleinias: naturally.

athenian: 'this, then, is always the mode and fashion in which justice
exists.'

cleinias: certainly, if they are correct in their view.

athenian: why, yes, this is one of those false principles of government
to which we were referring.

cleinias: which do you mean?

athenian: those which we were examining when we spoke of who ought to
govern whom. did we not arrive at the conclusion that parents ought
to govern their children, and the elder the younger, and the noble the
ignoble? and there were many other principles, if you remember, and they
were not always consistent. one principle was this very principle of
might, and we said that pindar considered violence natural and justified
it.

cleinias: yes; i remember.

athenian: consider, then, to whom our state is to be entrusted. for
there is a thing which has occurred times without number in states--

cleinias: what thing?

athenian: that when there has been a contest for power, those who gain
the upper hand so entirely monopolize the government, as to refuse all
share to the defeated party and their descendants--they live watching
one another, the ruling class being in perpetual fear that some one who
has a recollection of former wrongs will come into power and rise up
against them. now, according to our view, such governments are not
polities at all, nor are laws right which are passed for the good of
particular classes and not for the good of the whole state. states
which have such laws are not polities but parties, and their notions of
justice are simply unmeaning. i say this, because i am going to assert
that we must not entrust the government in your state to any one
because he is rich, or because he possesses any other advantage, such as
strength, or stature, or again birth: but he who is most obedient to the
laws of the state, he shall win the palm; and to him who is victorious
in the first degree shall be given the highest office and chief ministry
of the gods; and the second to him who bears the second palm; and on a
similar principle shall all the other offices be assigned to those who
come next in order. and when i call the rulers servants or ministers of
the law, i give them this name not for the sake of novelty, but because
i certainly believe that upon such service or ministry depends the well-
or ill-being of the state. for that state in which the law is subject
and has no authority, i perceive to be on the highway to ruin; but i see
that the state in which the law is above the rulers, and the rulers are
the inferiors of the law, has salvation, and every blessing which the
gods can confer.

cleinias: truly, stranger, you see with the keen vision of age.

athenian: why, yes; every man when he is young has that sort of vision
dullest, and when he is old keenest.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and now, what is to be the next step? may we not suppose the
colonists to have arrived, and proceed to make our speech to them?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: 'friends,' we say to them,--'god, as the old tradition
declares, holding in his hand the beginning, middle, and end of all
that is, travels according to his nature in a straight line towards the
accomplishment of his end. justice always accompanies him, and is the
punisher of those who fall short of the divine law. to justice, he who
would be happy holds fast, and follows in her company with all humility
and order; but he who is lifted up with pride, or elated by wealth
or rank, or beauty, who is young and foolish, and has a soul hot with
insolence, and thinks that he has no need of any guide or ruler, but is
able himself to be the guide of others, he, i say, is left deserted
of god; and being thus deserted, he takes to him others who are like
himself, and dances about, throwing all things into confusion, and many
think that he is a great man, but in a short time he pays a penalty
which justice cannot but approve, and is utterly destroyed, and his
family and city with him. wherefore, seeing that human things are thus
ordered, what should a wise man do or think, or not do or think'?

cleinias: every man ought to make up his mind that he will be one of the
followers of god; there can be no doubt of that.

athenian: then what life is agreeable to god, and becoming in his
followers? one only, expressed once for all in the old saying that
'like agrees with like, with measure measure,' but things which have no
measure agree neither with themselves nor with the things which have.
now god ought to be to us the measure of all things, and not man
(compare crat.; theaet.), as men commonly say (protagoras): the words
are far more true of him. and he who would be dear to god must, as far
as is possible, be like him and such as he is. wherefore the temperate
man is the friend of god, for he is like him; and the intemperate man is
unlike him, and different from him, and unjust. and the same applies to
other things; and this is the conclusion, which is also the noblest and
truest of all sayings,--that for the good man to offer sacrifice to the
gods, and hold converse with them by means of prayers and offerings and
every kind of service, is the noblest and best of all things, and also
the most conducive to a happy life, and very fit and meet. but with the
bad man, the opposite of this is true: for the bad man has an impure
soul, whereas the good is pure; and from one who is polluted, neither
a good man nor god can without impropriety receive gifts. wherefore the
unholy do only waste their much service upon the gods, but when offered
by any holy man, such service is most acceptable to them. this is the
mark at which we ought to aim. but what weapons shall we use, and how
shall we direct them? in the first place, we affirm that next after the
olympian gods and the gods of the state, honour should be given to the
gods below; they should receive everything in even numbers, and of
the second choice, and ill omen, while the odd numbers, and the first
choice, and the things of lucky omen, are given to the gods above, by
him who would rightly hit the mark of piety. next to these gods, a wise
man will do service to the demons or spirits, and then to the heroes,
and after them will follow the private and ancestral gods, who are
worshipped as the law prescribes in the places which are sacred to them.
next comes the honour of living parents, to whom, as is meet, we have to
pay the first and greatest and oldest of all debts, considering that all
which a man has belongs to those who gave him birth and brought him up,
and that he must do all that he can to minister to them, first, in his
property, secondly, in his person, and thirdly, in his soul, in return
for the endless care and travail which they bestowed upon him of old,
in the days of his infancy, and which he is now to pay back to them when
they are old and in the extremity of their need. and all his life long
he ought never to utter, or to have uttered, an unbecoming word to them;
for of light and fleeting words the penalty is most severe; nemesis, the
messenger of justice, is appointed to watch over all such matters. when
they are angry and want to satisfy their feelings in word or deed,
he should give way to them; for a father who thinks that he has been
wronged by his son may be reasonably expected to be very angry. at
their death, the most moderate funeral is best, neither exceeding the
customary expense, nor yet falling short of the honour which has been
usually shown by the former generation to their parents. and let a man
not forget to pay the yearly tribute of respect to the dead, honouring
them chiefly by omitting nothing that conduces to a perpetual
remembrance of them, and giving a reasonable portion of his fortune to
the dead. doing this, and living after this manner, we shall receive our
reward from the gods and those who are above us (i.e. the demons); and
we shall spend our days for the most part in good hope. and how a man
ought to order what relates to his descendants and his kindred and
friends and fellow-citizens, and the rites of hospitality taught by
heaven, and the intercourse which arises out of all these duties, with a
view to the embellishment and orderly regulation of his own life--these
things, i say, the laws, as we proceed with them, will accomplish,
partly persuading, and partly when natures do not yield to the
persuasion of custom, chastising them by might and right, and will thus
render our state, if the gods co-operate with us, prosperous and happy.
but of what has to be said, and must be said by the legislator who is of
my way of thinking, and yet, if said in the form of law, would be out of
place--of this i think that he may give a sample for the instruction of
himself and of those for whom he is legislating; and then when, as far
as he is able, he has gone through all the preliminaries, he may proceed
to the work of legislation. now, what will be the form of such prefaces?
there may be a difficulty in including or describing them all under a
single form, but i think that we may get some notion of them if we can
guarantee one thing.

cleinias: what is that?

athenian: i should wish the citizens to be as readily persuaded to
virtue as possible; this will surely be the aim of the legislator in all
his laws.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: the proposal appears to me to be of some value; and i think
that a person will listen with more gentleness and good-will to the
precepts addressed to him by the legislator, when his soul is not
altogether unprepared to receive them. even a little done in the way of
conciliation gains his ear, and is always worth having. for there is
no great inclination or readiness on the part of mankind to be made as
good, or as quickly good, as possible. the case of the many proves the
wisdom of hesiod, who says that the road to wickedness is smooth and can
be travelled without perspiring, because it is so very short:

'but before virtue the immortal gods have placed the sweat of labour,
and long and steep is the way thither, and rugged at first; but when
you have reached the top, although difficult before, it is then easy.'
(works and days.)

cleinias: yes; and he certainly speaks well.

athenian: very true: and now let me tell you the effect which the
preceding discourse has had upon me.

cleinias: proceed.

athenian: suppose that we have a little conversation with the
legislator, and say to him--'o, legislator, speak; if you know what we
ought to say and do, you can surely tell.'

cleinias: of course he can.

athenian: 'did we not hear you just now saying, that the legislator
ought not to allow the poets to do what they liked? for that they would
not know in which of their words they went against the laws, to the hurt
of the state.'

cleinias: that is true.

athenian: may we not fairly make answer to him on behalf of the poets?

cleinias: what answer shall we make to him?

athenian: that the poet, according to the tradition which has ever
prevailed among us, and is accepted of all men, when he sits down on the
tripod of the muse, is not in his right mind; like a fountain, he allows
to flow out freely whatever comes in, and his art being imitative, he is
often compelled to represent men of opposite dispositions, and thus to
contradict himself; neither can he tell whether there is more truth in
one thing that he has said than in another. this is not the case in a
law; the legislator must give not two rules about the same thing, but
one only. take an example from what you have just been saying. of three
kinds of funerals, there is one which is too extravagant, another is too
niggardly, the third in a mean; and you choose and approve and order the
last without qualification. but if i had an extremely rich wife, and she
bade me bury her and describe her burial in a poem, i should praise
the extravagant sort; and a poor miserly man, who had not much money to
spend, would approve of the niggardly; and the man of moderate means,
who was himself moderate, would praise a moderate funeral. now you in
the capacity of legislator must not barely say 'a moderate funeral,'
but you must define what moderation is, and how much; unless you are
definite, you must not suppose that you are speaking a language that can
become law.

cleinias: certainly not.

athenian: and is our legislator to have no preface to his laws, but
to say at once do this, avoid that--and then holding the penalty in
terrorem, to go on to another law; offering never a word of advice or
exhortation to those for whom he is legislating, after the manner of
some doctors? for of doctors, as i may remind you, some have a gentler,
others a ruder method of cure; and as children ask the doctor to be
gentle with them, so we will ask the legislator to cure our disorders
with the gentlest remedies. what i mean to say is, that besides doctors
there are doctors' servants, who are also styled doctors.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and whether they are slaves or freemen makes no difference;
they acquire their knowledge of medicine by obeying and observing their
masters; empirically and not according to the natural way of learning,
as the manner of freemen is, who have learned scientifically themselves
the art which they impart scientifically to their pupils. you are aware
that there are these two classes of doctors?

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: and did you ever observe that there are two classes of
patients in states, slaves and freemen; and the slave doctors run about
and cure the slaves, or wait for them in the dispensaries--practitioners
of this sort never talk to their patients individually, or let them talk
about their own individual complaints? the slave doctor prescribes what
mere experience suggests, as if he had exact knowledge; and when he has
given his orders, like a tyrant, he rushes off with equal assurance
to some other servant who is ill; and so he relieves the master of the
house of the care of his invalid slaves. but the other doctor, who is
a freeman, attends and practices upon freemen; and he carries his
enquiries far back, and goes into the nature of the disorder; he enters
into discourse with the patient and with his friends, and is at once
getting information from the sick man, and also instructing him as far
as he is able, and he will not prescribe for him until he has first
convinced him; at last, when he has brought the patient more and more
under his persuasive influences and set him on the road to health, he
attempts to effect a cure. now which is the better way of proceeding in
a physician and in a trainer? is he the better who accomplishes his
ends in a double way, or he who works in one way, and that the ruder and
inferior?

cleinias: i should say, stranger, that the double way is far better.

athenian: should you like to see an example of the double and single
method in legislation?

cleinias: certainly i should.

athenian: what will be our first law? will not the legislator, observing
the order of nature, begin by making regulations for states about
births?

cleinias: he will.

athenian: in all states the birth of children goes back to the connexion
of marriage?

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and, according to the true order, the laws relating to
marriage should be those which are first determined in every state?

cleinias: quite so.

athenian: then let me first give the law of marriage in a simple form;
it may run as follows:--a man shall marry between the ages of thirty and
thirty-five, or, if he does not, he shall pay such and such a fine, or
shall suffer the loss of such and such privileges. this would be the
simple law about marriage. the double law would run thus:--a man shall
marry between the ages of thirty and thirty-five, considering that in a
manner the human race naturally partakes of immortality, which every man
is by nature inclined to desire to the utmost; for the desire of every
man that he may become famous, and not lie in the grave without a name,
is only the love of continuance. now mankind are coeval with all time,
and are ever following, and will ever follow, the course of time; and so
they are immortal, because they leave children's children behind them,
and partake of immortality in the unity of generation. and for a man
voluntarily to deprive himself of this gift, as he deliberately does who
will not have a wife or children, is impiety. he who obeys the law shall
be free, and shall pay no fine; but he who is disobedient, and does not
marry, when he has arrived at the age of thirty-five, shall pay a yearly
fine of a certain amount, in order that he may not imagine his celibacy
to bring ease and profit to him; and he shall not share in the honours
which the young men in the state give to the aged. comparing now the
two forms of the law, you will be able to arrive at a judgment about any
other laws--whether they should be double in length even when shortest,
because they have to persuade as well as threaten, or whether they shall
only threaten and be of half the length.

megillus: the shorter form, stranger, would be more in accordance with
lacedaemonian custom; although, for my own part, if any one were to ask
me which i myself prefer in the state, i should certainly determine in
favour of the longer; and i would have every law made after the same
pattern, if i had to choose. but i think that cleinias is the person to
be consulted, for his is the state which is going to use these laws.

cleinias: thank you, megillus.

athenian: whether, in the abstract, words are to be many or few, is a
very foolish question; the best form, and not the shortest, is to be
approved; nor is length at all to be regarded. of the two forms of law
which have been recited, the one is not only twice as good in practical
usefulness as the other, but the case is like that of the two kinds
of doctors, which i was just now mentioning. and yet legislators never
appear to have considered that they have two instruments which they
might use in legislation--persuasion and force; for in dealing with the
rude and uneducated multitude, they use the one only as far as they can;
they do not mingle persuasion with coercion, but employ force pure and
simple. moreover, there is a third point, sweet friends, which ought to
be, and never is, regarded in our existing laws.

cleinias: what is it?

athenian: a point arising out of our previous discussion, which comes
into my mind in some mysterious way. all this time, from early dawn
until noon, have we been talking about laws in this charming retreat:
now we are going to promulgate our laws, and what has preceded was only
the prelude of them. why do i mention this? for this reason:--because
all discourses and vocal exercises have preludes and overtures, which
are a sort of artistic beginnings intended to help the strain which
is to be performed; lyric measures and music of every other kind have
preludes framed with wonderful care. but of the truer and higher
strain of law and politics, no one has ever yet uttered any prelude, or
composed or published any, as though there was no such thing in
nature. whereas our present discussion seems to me to imply that there
is;--these double laws, of which we were speaking, are not exactly
double, but they are in two parts, the law and the prelude of the law.
the arbitrary command, which was compared to the commands of doctors,
whom we described as of the meaner sort, was the law pure and simple;
and that which preceded, and was described by our friend here as
being hortatory only, was, although in fact, an exhortation, likewise
analogous to the preamble of a discourse. for i imagine that all this
language of conciliation, which the legislator has been uttering in the
preface of the law, was intended to create good-will in the person whom
he addressed, in order that, by reason of this good-will, he might
more intelligently receive his command, that is to say, the law. and
therefore, in my way of speaking, this is more rightly described as the
preamble than as the matter of the law. and i must further proceed to
observe, that to all his laws, and to each separately, the legislator
should prefix a preamble; he should remember how great will be the
difference between them, according as they have, or have not, such
preambles, as in the case already given.

cleinias: the lawgiver, if he asks my opinion, will certainly legislate
in the form which you advise.

athenian: i think that you are right, cleinias, in affirming that all
laws have preambles, and that throughout the whole of this work of
legislation every single law should have a suitable preamble at the
beginning; for that which is to follow is most important, and it makes
all the difference whether we clearly remember the preambles or not. yet
we should be wrong in requiring that all laws, small and great alike,
should have preambles of the same kind, any more than all songs or
speeches; although they may be natural to all, they are not always
necessary, and whether they are to be employed or not has in each case
to be left to the judgment of the speaker or the musician, or, in the
present instance, of the lawgiver.

cleinias: that i think is most true. and now, stranger, without delay
let us return to the argument, and, as people say in play, make a second
and better beginning, if you please, with the principles which we have
been laying down, which we never thought of regarding as a preamble
before, but of which we may now make a preamble, and not merely consider
them to be chance topics of discourse. let us acknowledge, then, that
we have a preamble. about the honour of the gods and the respect of
parents, enough has been already said; and we may proceed to the topics
which follow next in order, until the preamble is deemed by you to be
complete; and after that you shall go through the laws themselves.

athenian: i understand you to mean that we have made a sufficient
preamble about gods and demigods, and about parents living or dead; and
now you would have us bring the rest of the subject into the light of
day?

cleinias: exactly.

athenian: after this, as is meet and for the interest of us all, i the
speaker, and you the listeners, will try to estimate all that relates
to the souls and bodies and properties of the citizens, as regards both
their occupations and amusements, and thus arrive, as far as in us lies,
at the nature of education. these then are the topics which follow next
in order.

cleinias: very good.




book v.

athenian: listen, all ye who have just now heard the laws about gods,
and about our dear forefathers:--of all the things which a man has, next
to the gods, his soul is the most divine and most truly his own. now in
every man there are two parts: the better and superior, which rules,
and the worse and inferior, which serves; and the ruling part of him is
always to be preferred to the subject. wherefore i am right in bidding
every one next to the gods, who are our masters, and those who in order
follow them (i.e. the demons), to honour his own soul, which every one
seems to honour, but no one honours as he ought; for honour is a divine
good, and no evil thing is honourable; and he who thinks that he can
honour the soul by word or gift, or any sort of compliance, without
making her in any way better, seems to honour her, but honours her not
at all. for example, every man, from his very boyhood, fancies that
he is able to know everything, and thinks that he honours his soul by
praising her, and he is very ready to let her do whatever she may like.
but i mean to say that in acting thus he injures his soul, and is far
from honouring her; whereas, in our opinion, he ought to honour her as
second only to the gods. again, when a man thinks that others are to be
blamed, and not himself, for the errors which he has committed from time
to time, and the many and great evils which befell him in consequence,
and is always fancying himself to be exempt and innocent, he is under
the idea that he is honouring his soul; whereas the very reverse is the
fact, for he is really injuring her. and when, disregarding the word and
approval of the legislator, he indulges in pleasure, then again he is
far from honouring her; he only dishonours her, and fills her full of
evil and remorse; or when he does not endure to the end the labours and
fears and sorrows and pains which the legislator approves, but gives way
before them, then, by yielding, he does not honour the soul, but by all
such conduct he makes her to be dishonourable; nor when he thinks that
life at any price is a good, does he honour her, but yet once more he
dishonours her; for the soul having a notion that the world below is all
evil, he yields to her, and does not resist and teach or convince her
that, for aught she knows, the world of the gods below, instead of being
evil, may be the greatest of all goods. again, when any one prefers
beauty to virtue, what is this but the real and utter dishonour of the
soul? for such a preference implies that the body is more honourable
than the soul; and this is false, for there is nothing of earthly birth
which is more honourable than the heavenly, and he who thinks otherwise
of the soul has no idea how greatly he undervalues this wonderful
possession; nor, again, when a person is willing, or not unwilling, to
acquire dishonest gains, does he then honour his soul with gifts--far
otherwise; he sells her glory and honour for a small piece of gold; but
all the gold which is under or upon the earth is not enough to give in
exchange for virtue. in a word, i may say that he who does not estimate
the base and evil, the good and noble, according to the standard of the
legislator, and abstain in every possible way from the one and practise
the other to the utmost of his power, does not know that in all these
respects he is most foully and disgracefully abusing his soul, which is
the divinest part of man; for no one, as i may say, ever considers that
which is declared to be the greatest penalty of evil-doing--namely, to
grow into the likeness of bad men, and growing like them to fly from the
conversation of the good, and be cut off from them, and cleave to and
follow after the company of the bad. and he who is joined to them must
do and suffer what such men by nature do and say to one another,--a
suffering which is not justice but retribution; for justice and the
just are noble, whereas retribution is the suffering which waits upon
injustice; and whether a man escape or endure this, he is miserable,--in
the former case, because he is not cured; while in the latter, he
perishes in order that the rest of mankind may be saved.

speaking generally, our glory is to follow the better and improve
the inferior, which is susceptible of improvement, as far as this is
possible. and of all human possessions, the soul is by nature most
inclined to avoid the evil, and track out and find the chief good; which
when a man has found, he should take up his abode with it during the
remainder of his life. wherefore the soul also is second (or next to
god) in honour; and third, as every one will perceive, comes the honour
of the body in natural order. having determined this, we have next to
consider that there is a natural honour of the body, and that of honours
some are true and some are counterfeit. to decide which are which is the
business of the legislator; and he, i suspect, would intimate that they
are as follows:--honour is not to be given to the fair body, or to the
strong or the swift or the tall, or to the healthy body (although many
may think otherwise), any more than to their opposites; but the mean
states of all these habits are by far the safest and most moderate; for
the one extreme makes the soul braggart and insolent, and the other,
illiberal and base; and money, and property, and distinction all go to
the same tune. the excess of any of these things is apt to be a source
of hatreds and divisions among states and individuals; and the defect
of them is commonly a cause of slavery. and, therefore, i would not have
any one fond of heaping up riches for the sake of his children, in order
that he may leave them as rich as possible. for the possession of great
wealth is of no use, either to them or to the state. the condition of
youth which is free from flattery, and at the same time not in need of
the necessaries of life, is the best and most harmonious of all, being
in accord and agreement with our nature, and making life to be most
entirely free from sorrow. let parents, then, bequeath to their children
not a heap of riches, but the spirit of reverence. we, indeed, fancy
that they will inherit reverence from us, if we rebuke them when they
show a want of reverence. but this quality is not really imparted to
them by the present style of admonition, which only tells them that the
young ought always to be reverential. a sensible legislator will rather
exhort the elders to reverence the younger, and above all to take
heed that no young man sees or hears one of themselves doing or saying
anything disgraceful; for where old men have no shame, there young men
will most certainly be devoid of reverence. the best way of training the
young is to train yourself at the same time; not to admonish them,
but to be always carrying out your own admonitions in practice. he who
honours his kindred, and reveres those who share in the same gods and
are of the same blood and family, may fairly expect that the gods who
preside over generation will be propitious to him, and will quicken his
seed. and he who deems the services which his friends and acquaintances
do for him, greater and more important than they themselves deem them,
and his own favours to them less than theirs to him, will have their
good-will in the intercourse of life. and surely in his relations to the
state and his fellow citizens, he is by far the best, who rather than
the olympic or any other victory of peace or war, desires to win the
palm of obedience to the laws of his country, and who, of all mankind,
is the person reputed to have obeyed them best through life. in his
relations to strangers, a man should consider that a contract is a
most holy thing, and that all concerns and wrongs of strangers are
more directly dependent on the protection of god, than wrongs done to
citizens; for the stranger, having no kindred and friends, is more to be
pitied by gods and men. wherefore, also, he who is most able to avenge
him is most zealous in his cause; and he who is most able is the genius
and the god of the stranger, who follow in the train of zeus, the god
of strangers. and for this reason, he who has a spark of caution in
him, will do his best to pass through life without sinning against
the stranger. and of offences committed, whether against strangers or
fellow-countrymen, that against suppliants is the greatest. for the god
who witnessed to the agreement made with the suppliant, becomes in a
special manner the guardian of the sufferer; and he will certainly not
suffer unavenged.

thus we have fairly described the manner in which a man is to act about
his parents, and himself, and his own affairs; and in relation to the
state, and his friends, and kindred, both in what concerns his own
countrymen, and in what concerns the stranger. we will now consider what
manner of man he must be who would best pass through life in respect of
those other things which are not matters of law, but of praise and
blame only; in which praise and blame educate a man, and make him more
tractable and amenable to the laws which are about to be imposed.

truth is the beginning of every good thing, both to gods and men; and he
who would be blessed and happy, should be from the first a partaker of
the truth, that he may live a true man as long as possible, for then
he can be trusted; but he is not to be trusted who loves voluntary
falsehood, and he who loves involuntary falsehood is a fool. neither
condition is enviable, for the untrustworthy and ignorant has no friend,
and as time advances he becomes known, and lays up in store for himself
isolation in crabbed age when life is on the wane: so that, whether his
children or friends are alive or not, he is equally solitary.--worthy of
honour is he who does no injustice, and of more than twofold honour,
if he not only does no injustice himself, but hinders others from doing
any; the first may count as one man, the second is worth many men,
because he informs the rulers of the injustice of others. and yet
more highly to be esteemed is he who co-operates with the rulers in
correcting the citizens as far as he can--he shall be proclaimed the
great and perfect citizen, and bear away the palm of virtue. the same
praise may be given about temperance and wisdom, and all other goods
which may be imparted to others, as well as acquired by a man for
himself; he who imparts them shall be honoured as the man of men, and he
who is willing, yet is not able, may be allowed the second place; but he
who is jealous and will not, if he can help, allow others to partake in
a friendly way of any good, is deserving of blame: the good, however,
which he has, is not to be undervalued by us because it is possessed
by him, but must be acquired by us also to the utmost of our power. let
every man, then, freely strive for the prize of virtue, and let there be
no envy. for the unenvious nature increases the greatness of states--he
himself contends in the race, blasting the fair fame of no man; but the
envious, who thinks that he ought to get the better by defaming others,
is less energetic himself in the pursuit of true virtue, and reduces his
rivals to despair by his unjust slanders of them. and so he makes the
whole city to enter the arena untrained in the practice of virtue, and
diminishes her glory as far as in him lies. now every man should
be valiant, but he should also be gentle. from the cruel, or hardly
curable, or altogether incurable acts of injustice done to him by
others, a man can only escape by fighting and defending himself and
conquering, and by never ceasing to punish them; and no man who is not
of a noble spirit is able to accomplish this. as to the actions of
those who do evil, but whose evil is curable, in the first place, let us
remember that the unjust man is not unjust of his own free will. for no
man of his own free will would choose to possess the greatest of evils,
and least of all in the most honourable part of himself. and the soul,
as we said, is of a truth deemed by all men the most honourable. in
the soul, then, which is the most honourable part of him, no one, if
he could help, would admit, or allow to continue the greatest of evils
(compare republic). the unrighteous and vicious are always to be pitied
in any case; and one can afford to forgive as well as pity him who is
curable, and refrain and calm one's anger, not getting into a passion,
like a woman, and nursing ill-feeling. but upon him who is incapable
of reformation and wholly evil, the vials of our wrath should be poured
out; wherefore i say that good men ought, when occasion demands, to be
both gentle and passionate.

of all evils the greatest is one which in the souls of most men
is innate, and which a man is always excusing in himself and never
correcting; i mean, what is expressed in the saying that 'every man by
nature is and ought to be his own friend.' whereas the excessive love of
self is in reality the source to each man of all offences; for the lover
is blinded about the beloved, so that he judges wrongly of the just,
the good, and the honourable, and thinks that he ought always to prefer
himself to the truth. but he who would be a great man ought to regard,
not himself or his interests, but what is just, whether the just act be
his own or that of another. through a similar error men are induced to
fancy that their own ignorance is wisdom, and thus we who may be truly
said to know nothing, think that we know all things; and because we will
not let others act for us in what we do not know, we are compelled to
act amiss ourselves. wherefore let every man avoid excess of self-love,
and condescend to follow a better man than himself, not allowing any
false shame to stand in the way. there are also minor precepts which are
often repeated, and are quite as useful; a man should recollect them and
remind himself of them. for when a stream is flowing out, there should
be water flowing in too; and recollection flows in while wisdom is
departing. therefore i say that a man should refrain from excess either
of laughter or tears, and should exhort his neighbour to do the same;
he should veil his immoderate sorrow or joy, and seek to behave with
propriety, whether the genius of his good fortune remains with him, or
whether at the crisis of his fate, when he seems to be mounting high and
steep places, the gods oppose him in some of his enterprises. still he
may ever hope, in the case of good men, that whatever afflictions are
to befall them in the future god will lessen, and that present evils he
will change for the better; and as to the goods which are the opposite
of these evils, he will not doubt that they will be added to them, and
that they will be fortunate. such should be men's hopes, and such should
be the exhortations with which they admonish one another, never losing
an opportunity, but on every occasion distinctly reminding themselves
and others of all these things, both in jest and earnest.

enough has now been said of divine matters, both as touching the
practices which men ought to follow, and as to the sort of persons
who they ought severally to be. but of human things we have not as yet
spoken, and we must; for to men we are discoursing and not to gods.
pleasures and pains and desires are a part of human nature, and on them
every mortal being must of necessity hang and depend with the most eager
interest. and therefore we must praise the noblest life, not only as the
fairest in appearance, but as being one which, if a man will only taste,
and not, while still in his youth, desert for another, he will find to
surpass also in the very thing which we all of us desire,--i mean in
having a greater amount of pleasure and less of pain during the whole of
life. and this will be plain, if a man has a true taste of them, as will
be quickly and clearly seen. but what is a true taste? that we have to
learn from the argument--the point being what is according to nature,
and what is not according to nature. one life must be compared with
another, the more pleasurable with the more painful, after this
manner:--we desire to have pleasure, but we neither desire nor choose
pain; and the neutral state we are ready to take in exchange, not
for pleasure but for pain; and we also wish for less pain and greater
pleasure, but less pleasure and greater pain we do not wish for; and
an equal balance of either we cannot venture to assert that we should
desire. and all these differ or do not differ severally in number and
magnitude and intensity and equality, and in the opposites of these when
regarded as objects of choice, in relation to desire. and such being the
necessary order of things, we wish for that life in which there are
many great and intense elements of pleasure and pain, and in which the
pleasures are in excess, and do not wish for that in which the opposites
exceed; nor, again, do we wish for that in which the elements of either
are small and few and feeble, and the pains exceed. and when, as i said
before, there is a balance of pleasure and pain in life, this is to be
regarded by us as the balanced life; while other lives are preferred by
us because they exceed in what we like, or are rejected by us because
they exceed in what we dislike. all the lives of men may be regarded by
us as bound up in these, and we must also consider what sort of lives
we by nature desire. and if we wish for any others, i say that we desire
them only through some ignorance and inexperience of the lives which
actually exist.

now, what lives are they, and how many in which, having searched out and
beheld the objects of will and desire and their opposites, and making of
them a law, choosing, i say, the dear and the pleasant and the best and
noblest, a man may live in the happiest way possible? let us say that
the temperate life is one kind of life, and the rational another, and
the courageous another, and the healthful another; and to these four let
us oppose four other lives--the foolish, the cowardly, the intemperate,
the diseased. he who knows the temperate life will describe it as in
all things gentle, having gentle pains and gentle pleasures, and placid
desires and loves not insane; whereas the intemperate life is impetuous
in all things, and has violent pains and pleasures, and vehement and
stinging desires, and loves utterly insane; and in the temperate life
the pleasures exceed the pains, but in the intemperate life the pains
exceed the pleasures in greatness and number and frequency. hence one of
the two lives is naturally and necessarily more pleasant and the other
more painful, and he who would live pleasantly cannot possibly choose to
live intemperately. and if this is true, the inference clearly is that
no man is voluntarily intemperate; but that the whole multitude of men
lack temperance in their lives, either from ignorance, or from want of
self-control, or both. and the same holds of the diseased and healthy
life; they both have pleasures and pains, but in health the pleasure
exceeds the pain, and in sickness the pain exceeds the pleasure. now our
intention in choosing the lives is not that the painful should exceed,
but the life in which pain is exceeded by pleasure we have determined to
be the more pleasant life. and we should say that the temperate life
has the elements both of pleasure and pain fewer and smaller and less
frequent than the intemperate, and the wise life than the foolish life,
and the life of courage than the life of cowardice; one of each pair
exceeding in pleasure and the other in pain, the courageous surpassing
the cowardly, and the wise exceeding the foolish. and so the one
class of lives exceeds the other class in pleasure; the temperate and
courageous and wise and healthy exceed the cowardly and foolish and
intemperate and diseased lives; and generally speaking, that which has
any virtue, whether of body or soul, is pleasanter than the vicious
life, and far superior in beauty and rectitude and excellence and
reputation, and causes him who lives accordingly to be infinitely
happier than the opposite.

enough of the preamble; and now the laws should follow; or, to speak
more correctly, an outline of them. as, then, in the case of a web
or any other tissue, the warp and the woof cannot be made of the same
materials (compare statesman), but the warp is necessarily superior as
being stronger, and having a certain character of firmness, whereas
the woof is softer and has a proper degree of elasticity;--in a
similar manner those who are to hold great offices in states, should be
distinguished truly in each case from those who have been but slenderly
proven by education. let us suppose that there are two parts in the
constitution of a state--one the creation of offices, the other the laws
which are assigned to them to administer.

but, before all this, comes the following consideration:--the shepherd
or herdsman, or breeder of horses or the like, when he has received his
animals will not begin to train them until he has first purified them in
a manner which befits a community of animals; he will divide the healthy
and unhealthy, and the good breed and the bad breed, and will send
away the unhealthy and badly bred to other herds, and tend the rest,
reflecting that his labours will be vain and have no effect, either on
the souls or bodies of those whom nature and ill nurture have corrupted,
and that they will involve in destruction the pure and healthy nature
and being of every other animal, if he should neglect to purify them.
now the case of other animals is not so important--they are only worth
introducing for the sake of illustration; but what relates to man is of
the highest importance; and the legislator should make enquiries, and
indicate what is proper for each one in the way of purification and
of any other procedure. take, for example, the purification of a
city--there are many kinds of purification, some easier and others more
difficult; and some of them, and the best and most difficult of them,
the legislator, if he be also a despot, may be able to effect; but the
legislator, who, not being a despot, sets up a new government and laws,
even if he attempt the mildest of purgations, may think himself happy if
he can complete his work. the best kind of purification is painful, like
similar cures in medicine, involving righteous punishment and inflicting
death or exile in the last resort. for in this way we commonly dispose
of great sinners who are incurable, and are the greatest injury of the
whole state. but the milder form of purification is as follows:--when
men who have nothing, and are in want of food, show a disposition to
follow their leaders in an attack on the property of the rich--these,
who are the natural plague of the state, are sent away by the legislator
in a friendly spirit as far as he is able; and this dismissal of them is
euphemistically termed a colony. and every legislator should contrive to
do this at once. our present case, however, is peculiar. for there is
no need to devise any colony or purifying separation under the
circumstances in which we are placed. but as, when many streams flow
together from many sources, whether springs or mountain torrents, into a
single lake, we ought to attend and take care that the confluent waters
should be perfectly clear, and in order to effect this, should pump and
draw off and divert impurities, so in every political arrangement there
may be trouble and danger. but, seeing that we are now only discoursing
and not acting, let our selection be supposed to be completed, and the
desired purity attained. touching evil men, who want to join and be
citizens of our state, after we have tested them by every sort of
persuasion and for a sufficient time, we will prevent them from coming;
but the good we will to the utmost of our ability receive as friends
with open arms.

another piece of good fortune must not be forgotten, which, as we were
saying, the heraclid colony had, and which is also ours,--that we have
escaped division of land and the abolition of debts; for these are
always a source of dangerous contention, and a city which is driven by
necessity to legislate upon such matters can neither allow the old ways
to continue, nor yet venture to alter them. we must have recourse to
prayers, so to speak, and hope that a slight change may be cautiously
effected in a length of time. and such a change can be accomplished
by those who have abundance of land, and having also many debtors,
are willing, in a kindly spirit, to share with those who are in want,
sometimes remitting and sometimes giving, holding fast in a path of
moderation, and deeming poverty to be the increase of a man's desires
and not the diminution of his property. for this is the great beginning
of salvation to a state, and upon this lasting basis may be erected
afterwards whatever political order is suitable under the circumstances;
but if the change be based upon an unsound principle, the future
administration of the country will be full of difficulties. that is a
danger which, as i am saying, is escaped by us, and yet we had better
say how, if we had not escaped, we might have escaped; and we may
venture now to assert that no other way of escape, whether narrow
or broad, can be devised but freedom from avarice and a sense of
justice--upon this rock our city shall be built; for there ought to be
no disputes among citizens about property. if there are quarrels of long
standing among them, no legislator of any degree of sense will proceed
a step in the arrangement of the state until they are settled. but that
they to whom god has given, as he has to us, to be the founders of a
new state as yet free from enmity--that they should create themselves
enmities by their mode of distributing lands and houses, would be
superhuman folly and wickedness.

how then can we rightly order the distribution of the land? in the first
place, the number of the citizens has to be determined, and also the
number and size of the divisions into which they will have to be formed;
and the land and the houses will then have to be apportioned by us
as fairly as we can. the number of citizens can only be estimated
satisfactorily in relation to the territory and the neighbouring
states. the territory must be sufficient to maintain a certain number of
inhabitants in a moderate way of life--more than this is not required;
and the number of citizens should be sufficient to defend themselves
against the injustice of their neighbours, and also to give them the
power of rendering efficient aid to their neighbours when they are
wronged. after having taken a survey of their's and their neighbours'
territory, we will determine the limits of them in fact as well as in
theory. and now, let us proceed to legislate with a view to perfecting
the form and outline of our state. the number of our citizens shall be
5040--this will be a convenient number; and these shall be owners of the
land and protectors of the allotment. the houses and the land will be
divided in the same way, so that every man may correspond to a lot. let
the whole number be first divided into two parts, and then into three;
and the number is further capable of being divided into four or five
parts, or any number of parts up to ten. every legislator ought to know
so much arithmetic as to be able to tell what number is most likely
to be useful to all cities; and we are going to take that number which
contains the greatest and most regular and unbroken series of divisions.
the whole of number has every possible division, and the number 5040
can be divided by exactly fifty-nine divisors, and ten of these proceed
without interval from one to ten: this will furnish numbers for war and
peace, and for all contracts and dealings, including taxes and divisions
of the land. these properties of number should be ascertained at leisure
by those who are bound by law to know them; for they are true, and
should be proclaimed at the foundation of the city, with a view to use.
whether the legislator is establishing a new state or restoring an old
and decayed one, in respect of gods and temples,--the temples which are
to be built in each city, and the gods or demi-gods after whom they
are to be called,--if he be a man of sense, he will make no change in
anything which the oracle of delphi, or dodona, or the god ammon, or
any ancient tradition has sanctioned in whatever manner, whether by
apparitions or reputed inspiration of heaven, in obedience to which
mankind have established sacrifices in connexion with mystic rites,
either originating on the spot, or derived from tyrrhenia or cyprus
or some other place, and on the strength of which traditions they have
consecrated oracles and images, and altars and temples, and portioned
out a sacred domain for each of them. the least part of all these ought
not to be disturbed by the legislator; but he should assign to
the several districts some god, or demi-god, or hero, and, in the
distribution of the soil, should give to these first their chosen domain
and all things fitting, that the inhabitants of the several districts
may meet at fixed times, and that they may readily supply their various
wants, and entertain one another with sacrifices, and become friends
and acquaintances; for there is no greater good in a state than that the
citizens should be known to one another. when not light but darkness and
ignorance of each other's characters prevails among them, no one will
receive the honour of which he is deserving, or the power or the justice
to which he is fairly entitled: wherefore, in every state, above all
things, every man should take heed that he have no deceit in him, but
that he be always true and simple; and that no deceitful person take any
advantage of him.

the next move in our pastime of legislation, like the withdrawal of the
stone from the holy line in the game of draughts, being an unusual one,
will probably excite wonder when mentioned for the first time. and yet,
if a man will only reflect and weigh the matter with care, he will see
that our city is ordered in a manner which, if not the best, is the
second best. perhaps also some one may not approve this form, because he
thinks that such a constitution is ill adapted to a legislator who
has not despotic power. the truth is, that there are three forms of
government, the best, the second and the third best, which we may just
mention, and then leave the selection to the ruler of the settlement.
following this method in the present instance, let us speak of the
states which are respectively first, second, and third in excellence,
and then we will leave the choice to cleinias now, or to any one else
who may hereafter have to make a similar choice among constitutions, and
may desire to give to his state some feature which is congenial to him
and which he approves in his own country.

the first and highest form of the state and of the government and of the
law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancient saying, that
'friends have all things in common.' whether there is anywhere now, or
will ever be, this communion of women and children and of property, in
which the private and individual is altogether banished from life, and
things which are by nature private, such as eyes and ears and hands,
have become common, and in some way see and hear and act in common, and
all men express praise and blame and feel joy and sorrow on the same
occasions, and whatever laws there are unite the city to the utmost
(compare republic),--whether all this is possible or not, i say that no
man, acting upon any other principle, will ever constitute a state which
will be truer or better or more exalted in virtue. whether such a state
is governed by gods or sons of gods, one, or more than one, happy are
the men who, living after this manner, dwell there; and therefore to
this we are to look for the pattern of the state, and to cling to this,
and to seek with all our might for one which is like this. the state
which we have now in hand, when created, will be nearest to immortality
and the only one which takes the second place; and after that, by the
grace of god, we will complete the third one. and we will begin by
speaking of the nature and origin of the second.

let the citizens at once distribute their land and houses, and not
till the land in common, since a community of goods goes beyond
their proposed origin, and nurture, and education. but in making the
distribution, let the several possessors feel that their particular
lots also belong to the whole city; and seeing that the earth is their
parent, let them tend her more carefully than children do their mother.
for she is a goddess and their queen, and they are her mortal subjects.
such also are the feelings which they ought to entertain to the gods and
demi-gods of the country. and in order that the distribution may always
remain, they ought to consider further that the present number
of families should be always retained, and neither increased nor
diminished. this may be secured for the whole city in the following
manner:--let the possessor of a lot leave the one of his children who is
his best beloved, and one only, to be the heir of his dwelling, and
his successor in the duty of ministering to the gods, the state and the
family, as well the living members of it as those who are departed when
he comes into the inheritance; but of his other children, if he have
more than one, he shall give the females in marriage according to the
law to be hereafter enacted, and the males he shall distribute as sons
to those citizens who have no children, and are disposed to receive
them; or if there should be none such, and particular individuals
have too many children, male or female, or too few, as in the case
of barrenness--in all these cases let the highest and most honourable
magistracy created by us judge and determine what is to be done with
the redundant or deficient, and devise a means that the number of 5040
houses shall always remain the same. there are many ways of regulating
numbers; for they in whom generation is affluent may be made to refrain
(compare arist. pol.), and, on the other hand, special care may be taken
to increase the number of births by rewards and stigmas, or we may meet
the evil by the elder men giving advice and administering rebuke to the
younger--in this way the object may be attained. and if after all
there be very great difficulty about the equal preservation of the 5040
houses, and there be an excess of citizens, owing to the too great love
of those who live together, and we are at our wits' end, there is still
the old device often mentioned by us of sending out a colony, which will
part friends with us, and be composed of suitable persons. if, on the
other hand, there come a wave bearing a deluge of disease, or a plague
of war, and the inhabitants become much fewer than the appointed number
by reason of bereavement, we ought not to introduce citizens of spurious
birth and education, if this can be avoided; but even god is said not to
be able to fight against necessity.

wherefore let us suppose this 'high argument' of ours to address us
in the following terms:--best of men, cease not to honour according to
nature similarity and equality and sameness and agreement, as regards
number and every good and noble quality. and, above all, observe the
aforesaid number 5040 throughout life; in the second place, do not
disparage the small and modest proportions of the inheritances which you
received in the distribution, by buying and selling them to one another.
for then neither will the god who gave you the lot be your friend, nor
will the legislator; and indeed the law declares to the disobedient that
these are the terms upon which he may or may not take the lot. in the
first place, the earth as he is informed is sacred to the gods; and in
the next place, priests and priestesses will offer up prayers over a
first, and second, and even a third sacrifice, that he who buys or sells
the houses or lands which he has received, may suffer the punishment
which he deserves; and these their prayers they shall write down in the
temples, on tablets of cypress-wood, for the instruction of posterity.
moreover they will set a watch over all these things, that they may be
observed;--the magistracy which has the sharpest eyes shall keep watch
that any infringement of these commands may be discovered and punished
as offences both against the law and the god. how great is the
benefit of such an ordinance to all those cities, which obey and are
administered accordingly, no bad man can ever know, as the old proverb
says; but only a man of experience and good habits. for in such an order
of things there will not be much opportunity for making money; no
man either ought, or indeed will be allowed, to exercise any ignoble
occupation, of which the vulgarity is a matter of reproach to a freeman,
and should never want to acquire riches by any such means.

further, the law enjoins that no private man shall be allowed to possess
gold and silver, but only coin for daily use, which is almost necessary
in dealing with artisans, and for payment of hirelings, whether slaves
or immigrants, by all those persons who require the use of them.
wherefore our citizens, as we say, should have a coin passing current
among themselves, but not accepted among the rest of mankind; with
a view, however, to expeditions and journeys to other lands,--for
embassies, or for any other occasion which may arise of sending out a
herald, the state must also possess a common hellenic currency. if a
private person is ever obliged to go abroad, let him have the consent of
the magistrates and go; and if when he returns he has any foreign money
remaining, let him give the surplus back to the treasury, and receive
a corresponding sum in the local currency. and if he is discovered to
appropriate it, let it be confiscated, and let him who knows and does
not inform be subject to curse and dishonour equally him who brought
the money, and also to a fine not less in amount than the foreign money
which has been brought back. in marrying and giving in marriage, no one
shall give or receive any dowry at all; and no one shall deposit money
with another whom he does not trust as a friend, nor shall he lend money
upon interest; and the borrower should be under no obligation to repay
either capital or interest. that these principles are best, any one may
see who compares them with the first principle and intention of a state.
the intention, as we affirm, of a reasonable statesman, is not what the
many declare to be the object of a good legislator, namely, that the
state for the true interests of which he is advising should be as great
and as rich as possible, and should possess gold and silver, and have
the greatest empire by sea and land;--this they imagine to be the real
object of legislation, at the same time adding, inconsistently, that the
true legislator desires to have the city the best and happiest possible.
but they do not see that some of these things are possible, and some
of them are impossible; and he who orders the state will desire what is
possible, and will not indulge in vain wishes or attempts to accomplish
that which is impossible. the citizen must indeed be happy and good, and
the legislator will seek to make him so; but very rich and very good
at the same time he cannot be, not, at least, in the sense in which the
many speak of riches. for they mean by 'the rich' the few who have the
most valuable possessions, although the owner of them may quite well be
a rogue. and if this is true, i can never assent to the doctrine that
the rich man will be happy--he must be good as well as rich. and good in
a high degree, and rich in a high degree at the same time, he cannot be.
some one will ask, why not? and we shall answer--because acquisitions
which come from sources which are just and unjust indifferently, are
more than double those which come from just sources only; and the sums
which are expended neither honourably nor disgracefully, are only
half as great as those which are expended honourably and on honourable
purposes. thus, if the one acquires double and spends half, the other
who is in the opposite case and is a good man cannot possibly be
wealthier than he. the first--i am speaking of the saver and not of the
spender--is not always bad; he may indeed in some cases be utterly bad,
but, as i was saying, a good man he never is. for he who receives money
unjustly as well as justly, and spends neither nor unjustly, will be a
rich man if he be also thrifty. on the other hand, the utterly bad is
in general profligate, and therefore very poor; while he who spends on
noble objects, and acquires wealth by just means only, can hardly be
remarkable for riches, any more than he can be very poor. our statement,
then, is true, that the very rich are not good, and, if they are not
good, they are not happy. but the intention of our laws was, that the
citizens should be as happy as may be, and as friendly as possible to
one another. and men who are always at law with one another, and amongst
whom there are many wrongs done, can never be friends to one another,
but only those among whom crimes and lawsuits are few and slight.
therefore we say that gold and silver ought not to be allowed in the
city, nor much of the vulgar sort of trade which is carried on by
lending money, or rearing the meaner kinds of live stock; but only the
produce of agriculture, and only so much of this as will not compel us
in pursuing it to neglect that for the sake of which riches exist--i
mean, soul and body, which without gymnastics, and without education,
will never be worth anything; and therefore, as we have said not once
but many times, the care of riches should have the last place in our
thoughts. for there are in all three things about which every man has
an interest; and the interest about money, when rightly regarded, is the
third and lowest of them: midway comes the interest of the body; and,
first of all, that of the soul; and the state which we are describing
will have been rightly constituted if it ordains honours according to
this scale. but if, in any of the laws which have been ordained, health
has been preferred to temperance, or wealth to health and temperate
habits, that law must clearly be wrong. wherefore, also, the legislator
ought often to impress upon himself the question--'what do i want?' and
'do i attain my aim, or do i miss the mark?' in this way, and in
this way only, he may acquit himself and free others from the work of
legislation.

let the allottee then hold his lot upon the conditions which we have
mentioned.

it would be well that every man should come to the colony having all
things equal; but seeing that this is not possible, and one man
will have greater possessions than another, for many reasons and in
particular in order to preserve equality in special crises of the state,
qualifications of property must be unequal, in order that offices and
contributions and distributions may be proportioned to the value of
each person's wealth, and not solely to the virtue of his ancestors or
himself, nor yet to the strength and beauty of his person, but also to
the measure of his wealth or poverty; and so by a law of inequality,
which will be in proportion to his wealth, he will receive honours
and offices as equally as possible, and there will be no quarrels
and disputes. to which end there should be four different standards
appointed according to the amount of property: there should be a first
and a second and a third and a fourth class, in which the citizens will
be placed, and they will be called by these or similar names: they may
continue in the same rank, or pass into another in any individual case,
on becoming richer from being poorer, or poorer from being richer. the
form of law which i should propose as the natural sequel would be as
follows:--in a state which is desirous of being saved from the greatest
of all plagues--not faction, but rather distraction;--there should
exist among the citizens neither extreme poverty, nor, again, excess of
wealth, for both are productive of both these evils. now the legislator
should determine what is to be the limit of poverty or wealth. let the
limit of poverty be the value of the lot; this ought to be preserved,
and no ruler, nor any one else who aspires after a reputation for
virtue, will allow the lot to be impaired in any case. this the
legislator gives as a measure, and he will permit a man to acquire
double or triple, or as much as four times the amount of this (compare
arist. pol.). but if a person have yet greater riches, whether he has
found them, or they have been given to him, or he has made them in
business, or has acquired by any stroke of fortune that which is in
excess of the measure, if he give back the surplus to the state, and to
the gods who are the patrons of the state, he shall suffer no penalty or
loss of reputation; but if he disobeys this our law, any one who likes
may inform against him and receive half the value of the excess, and the
delinquent shall pay a sum equal to the excess out of his own property,
and the other half of the excess shall belong to the gods. and let every
possession of every man, with the exception of the lot, be publicly
registered before the magistrates whom the law appoints, so that all
suits about money may be easy and quite simple.

the next thing to be noted is, that the city should be placed as nearly
as possible in the centre of the country; we should choose a place which
possesses what is suitable for a city, and this may easily be imagined
and described. then we will divide the city into twelve portions, first
founding temples to hestia, to zeus and to athene, in a spot which we
will call the acropolis, and surround with a circular wall, making the
division of the entire city and country radiate from this point. the
twelve portions shall be equalized by the provision that those which are
of good land shall be smaller, while those of inferior quality shall be
larger. the number of the lots shall be 5040, and each of them shall
be divided into two, and every allotment shall be composed of two such
sections; one of land near the city, the other of land which is at a
distance (compare arist. pol.). this arrangement shall be carried out in
the following manner: the section which is near the city shall be added
to that which is on the borders, and form one lot, and the portion which
is next nearest shall be added to the portion which is next farthest;
and so of the rest. moreover, in the two sections of the lots the
same principle of equalization of the soil ought to be maintained; the
badness and goodness shall be compensated by more and less. and the
legislator shall divide the citizens into twelve parts, and arrange the
rest of their property, as far as possible, so as to form twelve equal
parts; and there shall be a registration of all. after this they shall
assign twelve lots to twelve gods, and call them by their names, and
dedicate to each god their several portions, and call the tribes after
them. and they shall distribute the twelve divisions of the city in the
same way in which they divided the country; and every man shall have
two habitations, one in the centre of the country, and the other at the
extremity. enough of the manner of settlement.

now we ought by all means to consider that there can never be such a
happy concurrence of circumstances as we have described; neither can
all things coincide as they are wanted. men who will not take offence at
such a mode of living together, and will endure all their life long to
have their property fixed at a moderate limit, and to beget children in
accordance with our ordinances, and will allow themselves to be deprived
of gold and other things which the legislator, as is evident from these
enactments, will certainly forbid them; and will endure, further, the
situation of the land with the city in the middle and dwellings round
about;--all this is as if the legislator were telling his dreams, or
making a city and citizens of wax. there is truth in these objections,
and therefore every one should take to heart what i am going to say.
once more, then, the legislator shall appear and address us:--'o my
friends,' he will say to us, 'do not suppose me ignorant that there is
a certain degree of truth in your words; but i am of opinion that, in
matters which are not present but future, he who exhibits a pattern of
that at which he aims, should in nothing fall short of the fairest
and truest; and that if he finds any part of this work impossible of
execution he should avoid and not execute it, but he should contrive to
carry out that which is nearest and most akin to it; you must allow the
legislator to perfect his design, and when it is perfected, you should
join with him in considering what part of his legislation is expedient
and what will arouse opposition; for surely the artist who is to be
deemed worthy of any regard at all, ought always to make his work
self-consistent.'

having determined that there is to be a distribution into twelve
parts, let us now see in what way this may be accomplished. there is
no difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts admit of the greatest
number of divisions of that which they include, or in seeing the other
numbers which are consequent upon them, and are produced out of them
up to 5040; wherefore the law ought to order phratries and demes and
villages, and also military ranks and movements, as well as coins and
measures, dry and liquid, and weights, so as to be commensurable
and agreeable to one another. nor should we fear the appearance of
minuteness, if the law commands that all the vessels which a man
possesses should have a common measure, when we consider generally that
the divisions and variations of numbers have a use in respect of all
the variations of which they are susceptible, both in themselves and as
measures of height and depth, and in all sounds, and in motions, as well
those which proceed in a straight direction, upwards or downwards, as in
those which go round and round. the legislator is to consider all these
things and to bid the citizens, as far as possible, not to lose sight of
numerical order; for no single instrument of youthful education has such
mighty power, both as regards domestic economy and politics, and in the
arts, as the study of arithmetic. above all, arithmetic stirs up him who
is by nature sleepy and dull, and makes him quick to learn, retentive,
shrewd, and aided by art divine he makes progress quite beyond his
natural powers (compare republic). all such things, if only the
legislator, by other laws and institutions, can banish meanness and
covetousness from the souls of men, so that they can use them properly
and to their own good, will be excellent and suitable instruments of
education. but if he cannot, he will unintentionally create in them,
instead of wisdom, the habit of craft, which evil tendency may be
observed in the egyptians and phoenicians, and many other races, through
the general vulgarity of their pursuits and acquisitions, whether some
unworthy legislator of theirs has been the cause, or some impediment
of chance or nature. for we must not fail to observe, o megillus and
cleinias, that there is a difference in places, and that some beget
better men and others worse; and we must legislate accordingly. some
places are subject to strange and fatal influences by reason of diverse
winds and violent heats, some by reason of waters; or, again, from the
character of the food given by the earth, which not only affects the
bodies of men for good or evil, but produces similar results in their
souls. and in all such qualities those spots excel in which there is a
divine inspiration, and in which the demigods have their appointed lots,
and are propitious, not adverse, to the settlers in them. to all these
matters the legislator, if he have any sense in him, will attend as
far as man can, and frame his laws accordingly. and this is what you,
cleinias, must do, and to matters of this kind you must turn your mind
since you are going to colonize a new country.

cleinias: your words, athenian stranger, are excellent, and i will do as
you say.




book vi.

athenian: and now having made an end of the preliminaries we will
proceed to the appointment of magistracies.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: in the ordering of a state there are two parts: first, the
number of the magistracies, and the mode of establishing them; and,
secondly, when they have been established, laws again will have to be
provided for each of them, suitable in nature and number. but before
electing the magistrates let us stop a little and say a word in season
about the election of them.

cleinias: what have you got to say?

athenian: this is what i have to say;--every one can see, that
although the work of legislation is a most important matter, yet if a
well-ordered city superadd to good laws unsuitable offices, not only
will there be no use in having the good laws,--not only will they be
ridiculous and useless, but the greatest political injury and evil will
accrue from them.

cleinias: of course.

athenian: then now, my friend, let us observe what will happen in
the constitution of out intended state. in the first place, you will
acknowledge that those who are duly appointed to magisterial power, and
their families, should severally have given satisfactory proof of what
they are, from youth upward until the time of election; in the next
place, those who are to elect should have been trained in habits of law,
and be well educated, that they may have a right judgment, and may be
able to select or reject men whom they approve or disapprove, as they
are worthy of either. but how can we imagine that those who are brought
together for the first time, and are strangers to one another, and also
uneducated, will avoid making mistakes in the choice of magistrates?

cleinias: impossible.

athenian: the matter is serious, and excuses will not serve the turn. i
will tell you, then, what you and i will have to do, since you, as
you tell me, with nine others, have offered to settle the new state on
behalf of the people of crete, and i am to help you by the invention
of the present romance. i certainly should not like to leave the tale
wandering all over the world without a head;--a headless monster is such
a hideous thing.

cleinias: excellent, stranger.

athenian: yes; and i will be as good as my word.

cleinias: let us by all means do as you propose.

athenian: that we will, by the grace of god, if old age will only permit
us.

cleinias: but god will be gracious.

athenian: yes; and under his guidance let us consider a further point.

cleinias: what is it?

athenian: let us remember what a courageously mad and daring creation
this our city is.

cleinias: what had you in your mind when you said that?

athenian: i had in my mind the free and easy manner in which we are
ordaining that the inexperienced colonists shall receive our laws. now
a man need not be very wise, cleinias, in order to see that no one can
easily receive laws at their first imposition. but if we could anyhow
wait until those who have been imbued with them from childhood, and have
been nurtured in them, and become habituated to them, take their part in
the public elections of the state; i say, if this could be accomplished,
and rightly accomplished by any way or contrivance--then, i think that
there would be very little danger, at the end of the time, of a state
thus trained not being permanent.

cleinias: a reasonable supposition.

athenian: then let us consider if we can find any way out of the
difficulty; for i maintain, cleinias, that the cnosians, above all the
other cretans, should not be satisfied with barely discharging their
duty to the colony, but they ought to take the utmost pains to establish
the offices which are first created by them in the best and surest
manner. above all, this applies to the selection of the guardians of the
law, who must be chosen first of all, and with the greatest care; the
others are of less importance.

cleinias: what method can we devise of electing them?

athenian: this will be the method:--sons of the cretans, i shall say to
them, inasmuch as the cnosians have precedence over the other states,
they should, in common with those who join this settlement, choose
a body of thirty-seven in all, nineteen of them being taken from the
settlers, and the remainder from the citizens of cnosus. of these latter
the cnosians shall make a present to your colony, and you yourself shall
be one of the eighteen, and shall become a citizen of the new state; and
if you and they cannot be persuaded to go, the cnosians may fairly use a
little violence in order to make you.

cleinias: but why, stranger, do not you and megillus take a part in our
new city?

athenian: o, cleinias, athens is proud, and sparta too; and they are
both a long way off. but you and likewise the other colonists are
conveniently situated as you describe. i have been speaking of the
way in which the new citizens may be best managed under present
circumstances; but in after-ages, if the city continues to exist, let
the election be on this wise. all who are horse or foot soldiers, or
have seen military service at the proper ages when they were severally
fitted for it (compare arist. pol.), shall share in the election of
magistrates; and the election shall be held in whatever temple the state
deems most venerable, and every one shall carry his vote to the altar
of the god, writing down on a tablet the name of the person for whom he
votes, and his father's name, and his tribe, and ward; and at the side
he shall write his own name in like manner. any one who pleases may take
away any tablet which he does not think properly filled up, and exhibit
it in the agora for a period of not less than thirty days. the tablets
which are judged to be first, to the number of 300, shall be shown by
the magistrates to the whole city, and the citizens shall in like manner
select from these the candidates whom they prefer; and this second
selection, to the number of 100, shall be again exhibited to the
citizens; in the third, let any one who pleases select whom he pleases
out of the 100, walking through the parts of victims, and let them
choose for magistrates and proclaim the seven-and-thirty who have the
greatest number of votes. but who, cleinias and megillus, will order for
us in the colony all this matter of the magistrates, and the scrutinies
of them? if we reflect, we shall see that cities which are in process of
construction like ours must have some such persons, who cannot possibly
be elected before there are any magistrates; and yet they must be
elected in some way, and they are not to be inferior men, but the
best possible. for as the proverb says, 'a good beginning is half the
business'; and 'to have begun well' is praised by all, and in my opinion
is a great deal more than half the business, and has never been praised
by any one enough.

cleinias: that is very true.

athenian: then let us recognize the difficulty, and make clear to our
own minds how the beginning is to be accomplished. there is only
one proposal which i have to offer, and that is one which, under our
circumstances, is both necessary and expedient.

cleinias: what is it?

athenian: i maintain that this colony of ours has a father and mother,
who are no other than the colonizing state. well i know that many
colonies have been, and will be, at enmity with their parents. but in
early days the child, as in a family, loves and is beloved; even if
there come a time later when the tie is broken, still, while he is in
want of education, he naturally loves his parents and is beloved by
them, and flies to his relatives for protection, and finds in them his
only natural allies in time of need; and this parental feeling already
exists in the cnosians, as is shown by their care of the new city; and
there is a similar feeling on the part of the young city towards cnosus.
and i repeat what i was saying--for there is no harm in repeating a
good thing--that the cnosians should take a common interest in all these
matters, and choose, as far as they can, the eldest and best of the
colonists, to the number of not less than a hundred; and let there
be another hundred of the cnosians themselves. these, i say, on their
arrival, should have a joint care that the magistrates should be
appointed according to law, and that when they are appointed they should
undergo a scrutiny. when this has been effected, the cnosians
shall return home, and the new city do the best she can for her own
preservation and happiness. i would have the seven-and-thirty now, and
in all future time, chosen to fulfil the following duties:--let them,
in the first place, be the guardians of the law; and, secondly, of the
registers in which each one registers before the magistrate the amount
of his property, excepting four minae which are allowed to citizens of
the first class, three allowed to the second, two to the third, and a
single mina to the fourth. and if any one, despising the laws for the
sake of gain, be found to possess anything more which has not been
registered, let all that he has in excess be confiscated, and let him be
liable to a suit which shall be the reverse of honourable or fortunate.
and let any one who will, indict him on the charge of loving base gains,
and proceed against him before the guardians of the law. and if he be
cast, let him lose his share of the public possessions, and when there
is any public distribution, let him have nothing but his original lot;
and let him be written down a condemned man as long as he lives, in
some place in which any one who pleases can read about his offences. the
guardian of the law shall not hold office longer than twenty years, and
shall not be less than fifty years of age when he is elected; or if he
is elected when he is sixty years of age, he shall hold office for ten
years only; and upon the same principle, he must not imagine that he
will be permitted to hold such an important office as that of guardian
of the laws after he is seventy years of age, if he live so long.

these are the three first ordinances about the guardians of the law; as
the work of legislation progresses, each law in turn will assign to them
their further duties. and now we may proceed in order to speak of the
election of other officers; for generals have to be elected, and these
again must have their ministers, commanders, and colonels of horse,
and commanders of brigades of foot, who would be more rightly called by
their popular name of brigadiers. the guardians of the law shall propose
as generals men who are natives of the city, and a selection from the
candidates proposed shall be made by those who are or have been of the
age for military service. and if one who is not proposed is thought by
somebody to be better than one who is, let him name whom he prefers in
the place of whom, and make oath that he is better, and propose him;
and whichever of them is approved by vote shall be admitted to the final
selection; and the three who have the greatest number of votes shall
be appointed generals, and superintendents of military affairs, after
previously undergoing a scrutiny, like the guardians of the law. and let
the generals thus elected propose twelve brigadiers, one for each tribe;
and there shall be a right of counter-proposal as in the case of the
generals, and the voting and decision shall take place in the same way.
until the prytanes and council are elected, the guardians of the law
shall convene the assembly in some holy spot which is suitable to
the purpose, placing the hoplites by themselves, and the cavalry by
themselves, and in a third division all the rest of the army. all are
to vote for the generals (and for the colonels of horse), but the
brigadiers are to be voted for only by those who carry shields (i.e. the
hoplites). let the body of cavalry choose phylarchs for the generals;
but captains of light troops, or archers, or any other division of the
army, shall be appointed by the generals for themselves. there only
remains the appointment of officers of cavalry: these shall be proposed
by the same persons who proposed the generals, and the election and the
counter-proposal of other candidates shall be arranged in the same
way as in the case of the generals, and let the cavalry vote and the
infantry look on at the election; the two who have the greatest number
of votes shall be the leaders of all the horse. disputes about the
voting may be raised once or twice; but if the dispute be raised a third
time, the officers who preside at the several elections shall decide.

the council shall consist of 30 x 12 members--360 will be a convenient
number for sub-division. if we divide the whole number into four parts
of ninety each, we get ninety counsellors for each class. first, all
the citizens shall select candidates from the first class; they shall
be compelled to vote, and, if they do not, shall be duly fined. when the
candidates have been selected, some one shall mark them down; this shall
be the business of the first day. and on the following day, candidates
shall be selected from the second class in the same manner and under the
same conditions as on the previous day; and on the third day a selection
shall be made from the third class, at which every one may, if he likes
vote, and the three first classes shall be compelled to vote; but the
fourth and lowest class shall be under no compulsion, and any member of
this class who does not vote shall not be punished. on the fourth day
candidates shall be selected from the fourth and smallest class; they
shall be selected by all, but he who is of the fourth class shall suffer
no penalty, nor he who is of the third, if he be not willing to vote;
but he who is of the first or second class, if he does not vote shall be
punished;--he who is of the second class shall pay a fine of triple
the amount which was exacted at first, and he who is of the first class
quadruple. on the fifth day the rulers shall bring out the names noted
down, for all the citizens to see, and every man shall choose out of
them, under pain, if he do not, of suffering the first penalty; and
when they have chosen 180 out of each of the classes, they shall choose
one-half of them by lot, who shall undergo a scrutiny:--these are to
form the council for the year.

the mode of election which has been described is in a mean between
monarchy and democracy, and such a mean the state ought always to
observe; for servants and masters never can be friends, nor good and
bad, merely because they are declared to have equal privileges. for to
unequals equals become unequal, if they are not harmonised by measure;
and both by reason of equality, and by reason of inequality, cities are
filled with seditions. the old saying, that 'equality makes friendship,'
is happy and also true; but there is obscurity and confusion as to what
sort of equality is meant. for there are two equalities which are called
by the same name, but are in reality in many ways almost the opposite
of one another; one of them may be introduced without difficulty, by any
state or any legislator in the distribution of honours: this is the rule
of measure, weight, and number, which regulates and apportions them. but
there is another equality, of a better and higher kind, which is not so
easily recognized. this is the judgment of zeus; among men it avails
but little; that little, however, is the source of the greatest good
to individuals and states. for it gives to the greater more, and to the
inferior less and in proportion to the nature of each; and, above all,
greater honour always to the greater virtue, and to the less less;
and to either in proportion to their respective measure of virtue
and education. and this is justice, and is ever the true principle of
states, at which we ought to aim, and according to this rule order the
new city which is now being founded, and any other city which may be
hereafter founded. to this the legislator should look,--not to the
interests of tyrants one or more, or to the power of the people, but to
justice always; which, as i was saying, is the distribution of natural
equality among unequals in each case. but there are times at which every
state is compelled to use the words, 'just,' 'equal,' in a secondary
sense, in the hope of escaping in some degree from factions. for
equity and indulgence are infractions of the perfect and strict rule of
justice. and this is the reason why we are obliged to use the equality
of the lot, in order to avoid the discontent of the people; and so we
invoke god and fortune in our prayers, and beg that they themselves will
direct the lot with a view to supreme justice. and therefore, although
we are compelled to use both equalities, we should use that into which
the element of chance enters as seldom as possible.

thus, o my friends, and for the reasons given, should a state act which
would endure and be saved. but as a ship sailing on the sea has to be
watched night and day, in like manner a city also is sailing on a sea
of politics, and is liable to all sorts of insidious assaults; and
therefore from morning to night, and from night to morning, rulers must
join hands with rulers, and watchers with watchers, receiving and giving
up their trust in a perpetual succession. now a multitude can never
fulfil a duty of this sort with anything like energy. moreover, the
greater number of the senators will have to be left during the greater
part of the year to order their concerns at their own homes. they will
therefore have to be arranged in twelve portions, answering to the
twelve months, and furnish guardians of the state, each portion for a
single month. their business is to be at hand and receive any foreigner
or citizen who comes to them, whether to give information, or to put one
of those questions, to which, when asked by other cities, a city should
give an answer, and to which, if she ask them herself, she should
receive an answer; or again, when there is a likelihood of internal
commotions, which are always liable to happen in some form or other,
they will, if they can, prevent their occurring; or if they have already
occurred, will lose no time in making them known to the city, and
healing the evil. wherefore, also, this which is the presiding body of
the state ought always to have the control of their assemblies, and of
the dissolutions of them, ordinary as well as extraordinary. all this
is to be ordered by the twelfth part of the council, which is always
to keep watch together with the other officers of the state during one
portion of the year, and to rest during the remaining eleven portions.

thus will the city be fairly ordered. and now, who is to have the
superintendence of the country, and what shall be the arrangement?
seeing that the whole city and the entire country have been both of
them divided into twelve portions, ought there not to be appointed
superintendents of the streets of the city, and of the houses, and
buildings, and harbours, and the agora, and fountains, and sacred
domains, and temples, and the like?

cleinias: to be sure there ought.

athenian: let us assume, then, that there ought to be servants of the
temples, and priests and priestesses. there must also be superintendents
of roads and buildings, who will have a care of men, that they may do no
harm, and also of beasts, both within the enclosure and in the suburbs.
three kinds of officers will thus have to be appointed, in order that
the city may be suitably provided according to her needs. those who have
the care of the city shall be called wardens of the city; and those who
have the care of the agora shall be called wardens of the agora; and
those who have the care of the temples shall be called priests. those
who hold hereditary offices as priests or priestesses, shall not be
disturbed; but if there be few or none such, as is probable at the
foundation of a new city, priests and priestesses shall be appointed to
be servants of the gods who have no servants. some of our officers shall
be elected, and others appointed by lot, those who are of the people and
those who are not of the people mingling in a friendly manner in every
place and city, that the state may be as far as possible of one mind.
the officers of the temples shall be appointed by lot; in this way their
election will be committed to god, that he may do what is agreeable to
him. and he who obtains a lot shall undergo a scrutiny, first, as to
whether he is sound of body and of legitimate birth; and in the second
place, in order to show that he is of a perfectly pure family, not
stained with homicide or any similar impiety in his own person, and also
that his father and mother have led a similar unstained life. now
the laws about all divine things should be brought from delphi, and
interpreters appointed, under whose direction they should be used. the
tenure of the priesthood should always be for a year and no longer; and
he who will duly execute the sacred office, according to the laws of
religion, must be not less than sixty years of age--the laws shall
be the same about priestesses. as for the interpreters, they shall be
appointed thus:--let the twelve tribes be distributed into groups of
four, and let each group select four, one out of each tribe within the
group, three times; and let the three who have the greatest number of
votes (out of the twelve appointed by each group), after undergoing
a scrutiny, nine in all, be sent to delphi, in order that the god may
return one out of each triad; their age shall be the same as that of the
priests, and the scrutiny of them shall be conducted in the same manner;
let them be interpreters for life, and when any one dies let the four
tribes select another from the tribe of the deceased. moreover, besides
priests and interpreters, there must be treasurers, who will take charge
of the property of the several temples, and of the sacred domains, and
shall have authority over the produce and the letting of them; and
three of them shall be chosen from the highest classes for the greater
temples, and two for the lesser, and one for the least of all; the
manner of their election and the scrutiny of them shall be the same as
that of the generals. this shall be the order of the temples.

let everything have a guard as far as possible. let the defence of the
city be commited to the generals, and taxiarchs, and hipparchs, and
phylarchs, and prytanes, and the wardens of the city, and of the agora,
when the election of them has been completed. the defence of the country
shall be provided for as follows:--the entire land has been already
distributed into twelve as nearly as possible equal parts, and let the
tribe allotted to a division provide annually for it five wardens of the
country and commanders of the watch; and let each body of five have
the power of selecting twelve others out of the youth of their own
tribe,--these shall be not less than twenty-five years of age, and not
more than thirty. and let there be allotted to them severally every
month the various districts, in order that they may all acquire
knowledge and experience of the whole country. the term of service
for commanders and for watchers shall continue during two years. after
having had their stations allotted to them, they will go from place to
place in regular order, making their round from left to right as their
commanders direct them; (when i speak of going to the right, i mean that
they are to go to the east). and at the commencement of the second
year, in order that as many as possible of the guards may not only get
a knowledge of the country at any one season of the year, but may also
have experience of the manner in which different places are affected
at different seasons of the year, their then commanders shall lead them
again towards the left, from place to place in succession, until they
have completed the second year. in the third year other wardens of
the country shall be chosen and commanders of the watch, five for each
division, who are to be the superintendents of the bands of twelve.
while on service at each station, their attention shall be directed
to the following points:--in the first place, they shall see that the
country is well protected against enemies; they shall trench and dig
wherever this is required, and, as far as they can, they shall by
fortifications keep off the evil-disposed, in order to prevent them from
doing any harm to the country or the property; they shall use the beasts
of burden and the labourers whom they find on the spot: these will be
their instruments whom they will superintend, taking them, as far
as possible, at the times when they are not engaged in their regular
business. they shall make every part of the country inaccessible to
enemies, and as accessible as possible to friends (compare arist. pol.);
there shall be ways for man and beasts of burden and for cattle, and
they shall take care to have them always as smooth as they can; and
shall provide against the rains doing harm instead of good to the land,
when they come down from the mountains into the hollow dells; and shall
keep in the overflow by the help of works and ditches, in order that the
valleys, receiving and drinking up the rain from heaven, and providing
fountains and streams in the fields and regions which lie underneath,
may furnish even to the dry places plenty of good water. the fountains
of water, whether of rivers or of springs, shall be ornamented with
plantations and buildings for beauty; and let them bring together the
streams in subterraneous channels, and make all things plenteous; and if
there be a sacred grove or dedicated precinct in the neighbourhood,
they shall conduct the water to the actual temples of the gods, and so
beautify them at all seasons of the year. everywhere in such places the
youth shall make gymnasia for themselves, and warm baths for the
aged, placing by them abundance of dry wood, for the benefit of those
labouring under disease--there the weary frame of the rustic, worn with
toil, will receive a kindly welcome, far better than he would at the
hands of a not over-wise doctor.

the building of these and the like works will be useful and ornamental;
they will provide a pleasing amusement, but they will be a serious
employment too; for the sixty wardens will have to guard their several
divisions, not only with a view to enemies, but also with an eye to
professing friends. when a quarrel arises among neighbours or citizens,
and any one whether slave or freeman wrongs another, let the five
wardens decide small matters on their own authority; but where the
charge against another relates to greater matters, the seventeen
composed of the fives and twelves, shall determine any charges which one
man brings against another, not involving more than three minae. every
judge and magistrate shall be liable to give an account of his conduct
in office, except those who, like kings, have the final decision.
moreover, as regards the aforesaid wardens of the country, if they do
any wrong to those of whom they have the care, whether by imposing upon
them unequal tasks, or by taking the produce of the soil or implements
of husbandry without their consent; also if they receive anything in
the way of a bribe, or decide suits unjustly, or if they yield to the
influences of flattery, let them be publicly dishonoured; and in regard
to any other wrong which they do to the inhabitants of the country,
if the question be of a mina, let them submit to the decision of the
villagers in the neighbourhood; but in suits of greater amount, or in
case of lesser, if they refuse to submit, trusting that their monthly
removal into another part of the country will enable them to escape--in
such cases the injured party may bring his suit in the common court, and
if he obtain a verdict he may exact from the defendant, who refused to
submit, a double penalty.

the wardens and the overseers of the country, while on their two years'
service, shall have common meals at their several stations, and shall
all live together; and he who is absent from the common meal, or sleeps
out, if only for one day or night, unless by order of his commanders, or
by reason of absolute necessity, if the five denounce him and inscribe
his name in the agora as not having kept his guard, let him be deemed
to have betrayed the city, as far as lay in his power, and let him
be disgraced and beaten with impunity by any one who meets him and is
willing to punish him. if any of the commanders is guilty of such an
irregularity, the whole company of sixty shall see to it, and he who
is cognisant of the offence, and does not bring the offender to trial,
shall be amenable to the same laws as the younger offender himself, and
shall pay a heavier fine, and be incapable of ever commanding the young.
the guardians of the law are to be careful inspectors of these matters,
and shall either prevent or punish offenders. every man should remember
the universal rule, that he who is not a good servant will not be a
good master; a man should pride himself more upon serving well than upon
commanding well: first upon serving the laws, which is also the service
of the gods; in the second place, upon having served ancient and
honourable men in the days of his youth. furthermore, during the two
years in which any one is a warden of the country, his daily food ought
to be of a simple and humble kind. when the twelve have been chosen, let
them and the five meet together, and determine that they will be
their own servants, and, like servants, will not have other slaves and
servants for their own use, neither will they use those of the villagers
and husbandmen for their private advantage, but for the public
service only; and in general they should make up their minds to live
independently by themselves, servants of each other and of themselves.
further, at all seasons of the year, summer and winter alike, let them
be under arms and survey minutely the whole country; thus they will at
once keep guard, and at the same time acquire a perfect knowledge of
every locality. there can be no more important kind of information than
the exact knowledge of a man's own country; and for this as well as for
more general reasons of pleasure and advantage, hunting with dogs and
other kinds of sports should be pursued by the young. the service to
whom this is committed may be called the secret police or wardens of
the country; the name does not much signify, but every one who has
the safety of the state at heart will use his utmost diligence in this
service.

after the wardens of the country, we have to speak of the election of
wardens of the agora and of the city. the wardens of the country were
sixty in number, and the wardens of the city will be three, and will
divide the twelve parts of the city into three; like the former, they
shall have care of the ways, and of the different high roads which lead
out of the country into the city, and of the buildings, that they may be
all made according to law;--also of the waters, which the guardians of
the supply preserve and convey to them, care being taken that they may
reach the fountains pure and abundant, and be both an ornament and
a benefit to the city. these also should be men of influence, and at
leisure to take care of the public interest. let every man propose as
warden of the city any one whom he likes out of the highest class, and
when the vote has been given on them, and the number is reduced to the
six who have the greatest number of votes, let the electing officers
choose by lot three out of the six, and when they have undergone a
scrutiny let them hold office according to the laws laid down for them.
next, let the wardens of the agora be elected in like manner, out of the
first and second class, five in number: ten are to be first elected, and
out of the ten five are to be chosen by lot, as in the election of the
wardens of the city:--these when they have undergone a scrutiny are to
be declared magistrates. every one shall vote for every one, and he who
will not vote, if he be informed against before the magistrates, shall
be fined fifty drachmae, and shall also be deemed a bad citizen. let any
one who likes go to the assembly and to the general council; it shall
be compulsory to go on citizens of the first and second class, and they
shall pay a fine of ten drachmae if they be found not answering to their
names at the assembly. but the third and fourth class shall be under no
compulsion, and shall be let off without a fine, unless the magistrates
have commanded all to be present, in consequence of some urgent
necessity. the wardens of the agora shall observe the order appointed
by law for the agora, and shall have the charge of the temples and
fountains which are in the agora; and they shall see that no one injures
anything, and punish him who does, with stripes and bonds, if he be a
slave or stranger; but if he be a citizen who misbehaves in this way,
they shall have the power themselves of inflicting a fine upon him to
the amount of a hundred drachmae, or with the consent of the wardens of
the city up to double that amount. and let the wardens of the city
have a similar power of imposing punishments and fines in their own
department; and let them impose fines by their own department; and let
them impose fines by their own authority, up to a mina, or up to two
minae with the consent of the wardens of the agora.

in the next place, it will be proper to appoint directors of music
and gymnastic, two kinds of each--of the one kind the business will be
education, of the other, the superintendence of contests. in speaking
of education, the law means to speak of those who have the care of order
and instruction in gymnasia and schools, and of the going to school, and
of school buildings for boys and girls; and in speaking of contests,
the law refers to the judges of gymnastics and of music; these again
are divided into two classes, the one having to do with music, the other
with gymnastics; and the same who judge of the gymnastic contests of
men, shall judge of horses; but in music there shall be one set of
judges of solo singing, and of imitation--i mean of rhapsodists, players
on the harp, the flute and the like, and another who shall judge of
choral song. first of all, we must choose directors for the choruses of
boys, and men, and maidens, whom they shall follow in the amusement of
the dance, and for our other musical arrangements;--one director will be
enough for the choruses, and he should be not less than forty years of
age. one director will also be enough to introduce the solo singers, and
to give judgment on the competitors, and he ought not to be less than
thirty years of age. the director and manager of the choruses shall be
elected after the following manner:--let any persons who commonly take
an interest in such matters go to the meeting, and be fined if they do
not go (the guardians of the law shall judge of their fault), but those
who have no interest shall not be compelled. the elector shall propose
as director some one who understands music, and he in the scrutiny may
be challenged on the one part by those who say he has no skill, and
defended on the other hand by those who say that he has. ten are to be
elected by vote, and he of the ten who is chosen by lot shall undergo a
scrutiny, and lead the choruses for a year according to law. and in like
manner the competitor who wins the lot shall be leader of the solo and
concert music for that year; and he who is thus elected shall deliver
the award to the judges. in the next place, we have to choose judges
in the contests of horses and of men; these shall be selected from
the third and also from the second class of citizens, and three first
classes shall be compelled to go to the election, but the lowest may
stay away with impunity; and let there be three elected by lot out of
the twenty who have been chosen previously, and they must also have the
vote and approval of the examiners. but if any one is rejected in the
scrutiny at any ballot or decision, others shall be chosen in the same
manner, and undergo a similar scrutiny.

there remains the minister of the education of youth, male and female;
he too will rule according to law; one such minister will be sufficient,
and he must be fifty years old, and have children lawfully begotten,
both boys and girls by preference, at any rate, one or the other. he who
is elected, and he who is the elector, should consider that of all the
great offices of state this is the greatest; for the first shoot of any
plant, if it makes a good start towards the attainment of its natural
excellence, has the greatest effect on its maturity; and this is not
only true of plants, but of animals wild and tame, and also of men.
man, as we say, is a tame or civilized animal; nevertheless, he requires
proper instruction and a fortunate nature, and then of all animals he
becomes the most divine and most civilized (arist. pol.); but if he
be insufficiently or ill educated he is the most savage of earthly
creatures. wherefore the legislator ought not to allow the education of
children to become a secondary or accidental matter. in the first place,
he who would be rightly provident about them, should begin by taking
care that he is elected, who of all the citizens is in every way
best; him the legislator shall do his utmost to appoint guardian and
superintendent. to this end all the magistrates, with the exception of
the council and prytanes, shall go to the temple of apollo, and elect by
ballot him of the guardians of the law whom they severally think will be
the best superintendent of education. and he who has the greatest number
of votes, after he has undergone a scrutiny at the hands of all the
magistrates who have been his electors, with the exception of the
guardians of the law,--shall hold office for five years; and in the
sixth year let another be chosen in like manner to fill his office.

if any one dies while he is holding a public office, and more than
thirty days before his term of office expires, let those whose business
it is elect another to the office in the same manner as before. and if
any one who is entrusted with orphans dies, let the relations both on
the father's and mother's side, who are residing at home, including
cousins, appoint another guardian within ten days, or be fined a drachma
a day for neglect to do so.

a city which has no regular courts of law ceases to be a city; and
again, if a judge is silent and says no more in preliminary proceedings
than the litigants, as is the case in arbitrations, he will never be
able to decide justly; wherefore a multitude of judges will not easily
judge well, nor a few if they are bad. the point in dispute between the
parties should be made clear; and time, and deliberation, and repeated
examination, greatly tend to clear up doubts. for this reason, he who
goes to law with another, should go first of all to his neighbours and
friends who know best the questions at issue. and if he be unable to
obtain from them a satisfactory decision, let him have recourse to
another court; and if the two courts cannot settle the matter, let a
third put an end to the suit.

now the establishment of courts of justice may be regarded as a choice
of magistrates, for every magistrate must also be a judge of some
things; and the judge, though he be not a magistrate, yet in certain
respects is a very important magistrate on the day on which he is
determining a suit. regarding then the judges also as magistrates, let
us say who are fit to be judges, and of what they are to be judges,
and how many of them are to judge in each suit. let that be the supreme
tribunal which the litigants appoint in common for themselves, choosing
certain persons by agreement. and let there be two other tribunals: one
for private causes, when a citizen accuses another of wronging him and
wishes to get a decision; the other for public causes, in which some
citizen is of opinion that the public has been wronged by an individual,
and is willing to vindicate the common interests. and we must not forget
to mention how the judges are to be qualified, and who they are to be.
in the first place, let there be a tribunal open to all private persons
who are trying causes one against another for the third time, and let
this be composed as follows:--all the officers of state, as well annual
as those holding office for a longer period, when the new year is about
to commence, in the month following after the summer solstice, on the
last day but one of the year, shall meet in some temple, and calling god
to witness, shall dedicate one judge from every magistracy to be their
first-fruits, choosing in each office him who seems to them to be
the best, and whom they deem likely to decide the causes of his
fellow-citizens during the ensuing year in the best and holiest manner.
and when the election is completed, a scrutiny shall be held in the
presence of the electors themselves, and if any one be rejected another
shall be chosen in the same manner. those who have undergone the
scrutiny shall judge the causes of those who have declined the inferior
courts, and shall give their vote openly. the councillors and other
magistrates who have elected them shall be required to be hearers and
spectators of the causes; and any one else may be present who pleases.
if one man charges another with having intentionally decided wrong, let
him go to the guardians of the law and lay his accusation before them,
and he who is found guilty in such a case shall pay damages to the
injured party equal to half the injury; but if he shall appear to
deserve a greater penalty, the judges shall determine what additional
punishment he shall suffer, and how much more he ought to pay to the
public treasury, and to the party who brought the suit.

in the judgment of offences against the state, the people ought to
participate, for when any one wrongs the state all are wronged, and may
reasonably complain if they are not allowed to share in the decision.
such causes ought to originate with the people, and the ought also to
have the final decision of them, but the trial of them shall take place
before three of the highest magistrates, upon whom the plaintiff and the
defendant shall agree; and if they are not able to come to an agreement
themselves, the council shall choose one of the two proposed. and in
private suits, too, as far as is possible, all should have a share; for
he who has no share in the administration of justice, is apt to imagine
that he has no share in the state at all. and for this reason there
shall be a court of law in every tribe, and the judges shall be
chosen by lot;--they shall give their decisions at once, and shall be
inaccessible to entreaties. the final judgment shall rest with
that court which, as we maintain, has been established in the most
incorruptible form of which human things admit: this shall be the court
established for those who are unable to get rid of their suits either in
the courts of neighbours or of the tribes.

thus much of the courts of law, which, as i was saying, cannot be
precisely defined either as being or not being offices; a superficial
sketch has been given of them, in which some things have been told and
others omitted. for the right place of an exact statement of the laws
respecting suits, under their several heads, will be at the end of the
body of legislation;--let us then expect them at the end. hitherto our
legislation has been chiefly occupied with the appointment of offices.
perfect unity and exactness, extending to the whole and every particular
of political administration, cannot be attained to the full, until the
discussion shall have a beginning, middle, and end, and is complete in
every part. at present we have reached the election of magistrates, and
this may be regarded as a sufficient termination of what preceded. and
now there need no longer be any delay or hesitation in beginning the
work of legislation.

cleinias: i like what you have said, stranger; and i particularly like
your manner of tacking on the beginning of your new discourse to the end
of the former one.

athenian: thus far, then, the old men's rational pastime has gone off
well.

cleinias: you mean, i suppose, their serious and noble pursuit?

athenian: perhaps; but i should like to know whether you and i are
agreed about a certain thing.

cleinias: about what thing?

athenian: you know the endless labour which painters expend upon their
pictures--they are always putting in or taking out colours, or whatever
be the term which artists employ; they seem as if they would never cease
touching up their works, which are always being made brighter and more
beautiful.

cleinias: i know something of these matters from report, although i have
never had any great acquaintance with the art.

athenian: no matter; we may make use of the illustration
notwithstanding:--suppose that some one had a mind to paint a figure in
the most beautiful manner, in the hope that his work instead of losing
would always improve as time went on--do you not see that being a
mortal, unless he leaves some one to succeed him who will correct
the flaws which time may introduce, and be able to add what is left
imperfect through the defect of the artist, and who will further
brighten up and improve the picture, all his great labour will last but
a short time?

cleinias: true.

athenian: and is not the aim of the legislator similar? first,
he desires that his laws should be written down with all possible
exactness; in the second place, as time goes on and he has made an
actual trial of his decrees, will he not find omissions? do you imagine
that there ever was a legislator so foolish as not to know that many
things are necessarily omitted, which some one coming after him must
correct, if the constitution and the order of government is not to
deteriorate, but to improve in the state which he has established?

cleinias: assuredly, that is the sort of thing which every one would
desire.

athenian: and if any one possesses any means of accomplishing this by
word or deed, or has any way great or small by which he can teach a
person to understand how he can maintain and amend the laws, he should
finish what he has to say, and not leave the work incomplete.

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: and is not this what you and i have to do at the present
moment?

cleinias: what have we to do?

athenian: as we are about to legislate and have chosen our guardians of
the law, and are ourselves in the evening of life, and they as compared
with us are young men, we ought not only to legislate for them, but to
endeavour to make them not only guardians of the law but legislators
themselves, as far as this is possible.

cleinias: certainly; if we can.

athenian: at any rate, we must do our best.

cleinias: of course.

athenian: we will say to them--o friends and saviours of our laws, in
laying down any law, there are many particulars which we shall omit,
and this cannot be helped; at the same time, we will do our utmost to
describe what is important, and will give an outline which you shall
fill up. and i will explain on what principle you are to act. megillus
and cleinias and i have often spoken to one another touching these
matters, and we are of opinion that we have spoken well. and we hope
that you will be of the same mind with us, and become our disciples, and
keep in view the things which in our united opinion the legislator and
guardian of the law ought to keep in view. there was one main point
about which we were agreed--that a man's whole energies throughout life
should be devoted to the acquisition of the virtue proper to a man,
whether this was to be gained by study, or habit, or some mode of
acquisition, or desire, or opinion, or knowledge--and this applies
equally to men and women, old and young--the aim of all should always be
such as i have described; anything which may be an impediment, the good
man ought to show that he utterly disregards. and if at last necessity
plainly compels him to be an outlaw from his native land, rather than
bow his neck to the yoke of slavery and be ruled by inferiors, and he
has to fly, an exile he must be and endure all such trials, rather than
accept another form of government, which is likely to make men worse.
these are our original principles; and do you now, fixing your eyes
upon the standard of what a man and a citizen ought or ought not to
be, praise and blame the laws--blame those which have not this power
of making the citizen better, but embrace those which have; and with
gladness receive and live in them; bidding a long farewell to other
institutions which aim at goods, as they are termed, of a different
kind.

let us proceed to another class of laws, beginning with their foundation
in religion. and we must first return to the number 5040--the entire
number had, and has, a great many convenient divisions, and the number
of the tribes which was a twelfth part of the whole, being correctly
formed by 21 x 20 (5040/(21 x 20), i.e., 5040/420 = 12), also has them.
and not only is the whole number divisible by twelve, but also the
number of each tribe is divisible by twelve. now every portion should be
regarded by us as a sacred gift of heaven, corresponding to the months
and to the revolution of the universe (compare tim.). every city has a
guiding and sacred principle given by nature, but in some the division
or distribution has been more right than in others, and has been more
sacred and fortunate. in our opinion, nothing can be more right than the
selection of the number 5040, which may be divided by all numbers from
one to twelve with the single exception of eleven, and that admits of a
very easy correction; for if, turning to the dividend (5040), we deduct
two families, the defect in the division is cured. and the truth of this
may be easily proved when we have leisure. but for the present, trusting
to the mere assertion of this principle, let us divide the state; and
assigning to each portion some god or son of a god, let us give them
altars and sacred rites, and at the altars let us hold assemblies for
sacrifice twice in the month--twelve assemblies for the tribes, and
twelve for the city, according to their divisions; the first in honour
of the gods and divine things, and the second to promote friendship
and 'better acquaintance,' as the phrase is, and every sort of good
fellowship with one another. for people must be acquainted with those
into whose families and whom they marry and with those to whom they give
in marriage; in such matters, as far as possible, a man should deem
it all important to avoid a mistake, and with this serious purpose let
games be instituted (compare republic) in which youths and maidens shall
dance together, seeing one another and being seen naked, at a proper
age, and on a suitable occasion, not transgressing the rules of modesty.

the directors of choruses will be the superintendents and regulators
of these games, and they, together with the guardians of the law, will
legislate in any matters which we have omitted; for, as we said, where
there are numerous and minute details, the legislator must leave out
something. and the annual officers who have experience, and know what is
wanted, must make arrangements and improvements year by year, until
such enactments and provisions are sufficiently determined. a ten years'
experience of sacrifices and dances, if extending to all particulars,
will be quite sufficient; and if the legislator be alive they shall
communicate with him, but if he be dead then the several officers shall
refer the omissions which come under their notice to the guardians of
the law, and correct them, until all is perfect; and from that time
there shall be no more change, and they shall establish and use the new
laws with the others which the legislator originally gave them, and of
which they are never, if they can help, to change aught; or, if some
necessity overtakes them, the magistrates must be called into counsel,
and the whole people, and they must go to all the oracles of the gods;
and if they are all agreed, in that case they may make the change, but
if they are not agreed, by no manner of means, and any one who dissents
shall prevail, as the law ordains.

whenever any one over twenty-five years of age, having seen and been
seen by others, believes himself to have found a marriage connexion
which is to his mind, and suitable for the procreation of children, let
him marry if he be still under the age of five-and-thirty years; but
let him first hear how he ought to seek after what is suitable and
appropriate (compare arist. pol.). for, as cleinias says, every law
should have a suitable prelude.

cleinias: you recollect at the right moment, stranger, and do not miss
the opportunity which the argument affords of saying a word in season.

athenian: i thank you. we will say to him who is born of good parents--o
my son, you ought to make such a marriage as wise men would approve. now
they would advise you neither to avoid a poor marriage, nor specially
to desire a rich one; but if other things are equal, always to honour
inferiors, and with them to form connexions;--this will be for the
benefit of the city and of the families which are united; for the
equable and symmetrical tends infinitely more to virtue than the
unmixed. and he who is conscious of being too headstrong, and carried
away more than is fitting in all his actions, ought to desire to become
the relation of orderly parents; and he who is of the opposite temper
ought to seek the opposite alliance. let there be one word concerning
all marriages:--every man shall follow, not after the marriage which is
most pleasing to himself, but after that which is most beneficial to the
state. for somehow every one is by nature prone to that which is likest
to himself, and in this way the whole city becomes unequal in property
and in disposition; and hence there arise in most states the very
results which we least desire to happen. now, to add to the law an
express provision, not only that the rich man shall not marry into the
rich family, nor the powerful into the family of the powerful, but that
the slower natures shall be compelled to enter into marriage with the
quicker, and the quicker with the slower, may awaken anger as well as
laughter in the minds of many; for there is a difficulty in perceiving
that the city ought to be well mingled like a cup, in which the
maddening wine is hot and fiery, but when chastened by a soberer god,
receives a fair associate and becomes an excellent and temperate drink
(compare statesman). yet in marriage no one is able to see that the same
result occurs. wherefore also the law must let alone such matters, but
we should try to charm the spirits of men into believing the equability
of their children's disposition to be of more importance than equality
in excessive fortune when they marry; and him who is too desirous of
making a rich marriage we should endeavour to turn aside by reproaches,
not, however, by any compulsion of written law.

let this then be our exhortation concerning marriage, and let us
remember what was said before--that a man should cling to immortality,
and leave behind him children's children to be the servants of god in
his place for ever. all this and much more may be truly said by way of
prelude about the duty of marriage. but if a man will not listen, and
remains unsocial and alien among his fellow-citizens, and is still
unmarried at thirty-five years of age, let him pay a yearly fine;--he
who of the highest class shall pay a fine of a hundred drachmae, and he
who is of the second class a fine of seventy drachmae; the third class
shall pay sixty drachmae, and the fourth thirty drachmae, and let the
money be sacred to here; he who does not pay the fine annually shall owe
ten times the sum, which the treasurer of the goddess shall exact; and
if he fails in doing so, let him be answerable and give an account of
the money at his audit. he who refuses to marry shall be thus punished
in money, and also be deprived of all honour which the younger show to
the elder; let no young man voluntarily obey him, and, if he attempt to
punish any one, let every one come to the rescue and defend the injured
person, and he who is present and does not come to the rescue, shall be
pronounced by the law to be a coward and a bad citizen. of the marriage
portion i have already spoken; and again i say for the instruction of
poor men that he who neither gives nor receives a dowry on account of
poverty, has a compensation; for the citizens of our state are provided
with the necessaries of life, and wives will be less likely to be
insolent, and husbands to be mean and subservient to them on account of
property. and he who obeys this law will do a noble action; but he who
will not obey, and gives or receives more than fifty drachmae as the
price of the marriage garments if he be of the lowest, or more than a
mina, or a mina-and-a-half, if he be of the third or second classes,
or two minae if he be of the highest class, shall owe to the public
treasury a similar sum, and that which is given or received shall be
sacred to here and zeus; and let the treasurers of these gods exact the
money, as was said before about the unmarried--that the treasurers of
here were to exact the money, or pay the fine themselves.

the betrothal by a father shall be valid in the first degree, that by a
grandfather in the second degree, and in the third degree, betrothal by
brothers who have the same father; but if there are none of these alive,
the betrothal by a mother shall be valid in like manner; in cases
of unexampled fatality, the next of kin and the guardians shall have
authority. what are to be the rites before marriages, or any other
sacred acts, relating either to future, present, or past marriages,
shall be referred to the interpreters; and he who follows their advice
may be satisfied. touching the marriage festival, they shall assemble
not more than five male and five female friends of both families; and
a like number of members of the family of either sex, and no man shall
spend more than his means will allow; he who is of the richest class
may spend a mina,--he who is of the second, half a mina, and in the same
proportion as the census of each decreases: all men shall praise him who
is obedient to the law; but he who is disobedient shall be punished
by the guardians of the law as a man wanting in true taste, and
uninstructed in the laws of bridal song. drunkenness is always improper,
except at the festivals of the god who gave wine; and peculiarly
dangerous, when a man is engaged in the business of marriage; at such
a crisis of their lives a bride and bridegroom ought to have all their
wits about them--they ought to take care that their offspring may be
born of reasonable beings; for on what day or night heaven will give
them increase, who can say? moreover, they ought not to begetting
children when their bodies are dissipated by intoxication, but their
offspring should be compact and solid, quiet and compounded properly;
whereas the drunkard is all abroad in all his actions, and beside
himself both in body and soul. wherefore, also, the drunken man is bad
and unsteady in sowing the seed of increase, and is likely to beget
offspring who will be unstable and untrustworthy, and cannot be expected
to walk straight either in body or mind. hence during the whole year
and all his life long, and especially while he is begetting children, he
ought to take care and not intentionally do what is injurious to health,
or what involves insolence and wrong; for he cannot help leaving the
impression of himself on the souls and bodies of his offspring, and he
begets children in every way inferior. and especially on the day
and night of marriage should a man abstain from such things. for the
beginning, which is also a god dwelling in man, preserves all things,
if it meet with proper respect from each individual. he who marries is
further to consider, that one of the two houses in the lot is the nest
and nursery of his young, and there he is to marry and make a home
for himself and bring up his children, going away from his father and
mother. for in friendships there must be some degree of desire, in order
to cement and bind together diversities of character; but excessive
intercourse not having the desire which is created by time, insensibly
dissolves friendships from a feeling of satiety; wherefore a man and
his wife shall leave to his and her father and mother their own
dwelling-places, and themselves go as to a colony and dwell there, and
visit and be visited by their parents; and they shall beget and bring up
children, handing on the torch of life from one generation to another,
and worshipping the gods according to law for ever.

in the next place, we have to consider what sort of property will be
most convenient. there is no difficulty either in understanding or
acquiring most kinds of property, but there is great difficulty in what
relates to slaves. and the reason is, that we speak about them in a way
which is right and which is not right; for what we say about our slaves
is consistent and also inconsistent with our practice about them.

megillus: i do not understand, stranger, what you mean.

athenian: i am not surprised, megillus, for the state of the helots
among the lacedaemonians is of all hellenic forms of slavery the most
controverted and disputed about, some approving and some condemning
it; there is less dispute about the slavery which exists among the
heracleots, who have subjugated the mariandynians, and about the
thessalian penestae. looking at these and the like examples, what ought
we to do concerning property in slaves? i made a remark, in passing,
which naturally elicited a question about my meaning from you. it was
this:--we know that all would agree that we should have the best and
most attached slaves whom we can get. for many a man has found his
slaves better in every way than brethren or sons, and many times they
have saved the lives and property of their masters and their whole
house--such tales are well known.

megillus: to be sure.

athenian: but may we not also say that the soul of the slave is utterly
corrupt, and that no man of sense ought to trust them? and the wisest of
our poets, speaking of zeus, says:

'far-seeing zeus takes away half the understanding of men whom the day
of slavery subdues.'

different persons have got these two different notions of slaves in
their minds--some of them utterly distrust their servants, and, as if
they were wild beasts, chastise them with goads and whips, and make
their souls three times, or rather many times, as slavish as they were
before;--and others do just the opposite.

megillus: true.

cleinias: then what are we to do in our own country, stranger, seeing
that there are such differences in the treatment of slaves by their
owners?

athenian: well, cleinias, there can be no doubt that man is a
troublesome animal, and therefore he is not very manageable, nor likely
to become so, when you attempt to introduce the necessary division of
slave, and freeman, and master.

cleinias: that is obvious.

athenian: he is a troublesome piece of goods, as has been often shown
by the frequent revolts of the messenians, and the great mischiefs which
happen in states having many slaves who speak the same language, and the
numerous robberies and lawless life of the italian banditti, as they are
called. a man who considers all this is fairly at a loss. two remedies
alone remain to us,--not to have the slaves of the same country, nor if
possible, speaking the same language (compare aris. pol.); in this way
they will more easily be held in subjection: secondly, we should tend
them carefully, not only out of regard to them, but yet more out of
respect to ourselves. and the right treatment of slaves is to behave
properly to them, and to do to them, if possible, even more justice
than to those who are our equals; for he who naturally and genuinely
reverences justice, and hates injustice, is discovered in his dealings
with any class of men to whom he can easily be unjust. and he who in
regard to the natures and actions of his slaves is undefiled by impiety
and injustice, will best sow the seeds of virtue in them; and this may
be truly said of every master, and tyrant, and of every other having
authority in relation to his inferiors. slaves ought to be punished as
they deserve, and not admonished as if they were freemen, which will
only make them conceited. the language used to a servant ought always
to be that of a command (compare arist. pol.), and we ought not to jest
with them, whether they are males or females--this is a foolish way
which many people have of setting up their slaves, and making the life
of servitude more disagreeable both for them and for their masters.

cleinias: true.

athenian: now that each of the citizens is provided, as far as possible,
with a sufficient number of suitable slaves who can help him in what he
has to do, we may next proceed to describe their dwellings.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: the city being new and hitherto uninhabited, care ought to be
taken of all the buildings, and the manner of building each of them,
and also of the temples and walls. these, cleinias, were matters which
properly came before the marriages;--but, as we are only talking,
there is no objection to changing the order. if, however, our plan of
legislation is ever to take effect, then the house shall precede the
marriage if god so will, and afterwards we will come to the regulations
about marriage; but at present we are only describing these matters in a
general outline.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: the temples are to be placed all round the agora, and the
whole city built on the heights in a circle (compare arist. pol.), for
the sake of defence and for the sake of purity. near the temples are to
be placed buildings for the magistrates and the courts of law; in these
plaintiff and defendant will receive their due, and the places will be
regarded as most holy, partly because they have to do with holy things:
and partly because they are the dwelling-places of holy gods: and in
them will be held the courts in which cases of homicide and other trials
of capital offences may fitly take place. as to the walls, megillus, i
agree with sparta in thinking that they should be allowed to sleep in
the earth, and that we should not attempt to disinter them (compare
arist. pol.); there is a poetical saying, which is finely expressed,
that 'walls ought to be of steel and iron, and not of earth;' besides,
how ridiculous of us to be sending out our young men annually into
the country to dig and to trench, and to keep off the enemy by
fortifications, under the idea that they are not to be allowed to set
foot in our territory, and then, that we should surround ourselves
with a wall, which, in the first place, is by no means conducive to the
health of cities, and is also apt to produce a certain effeminacy in
the minds of the inhabitants, inviting men to run thither instead of
repelling their enemies, and leading them to imagine that their safety
is due not to their keeping guard day and night, but that when they are
protected by walls and gates, then they may sleep in safety; as if they
were not meant to labour, and did not know that true repose comes from
labour, and that disgraceful indolence and a careless temper of mind
is only the renewal of trouble. but if men must have walls, the private
houses ought to be so arranged from the first that the whole city may
be one wall, having all the houses capable of defence by reason of their
uniformity and equality towards the streets (compare arist. pol.). the
form of the city being that of a single dwelling will have an agreeable
aspect, and being easily guarded will be infinitely better for security.
until the original building is completed, these should be the principal
objects of the inhabitants; and the wardens of the city should
superintend the work, and should impose a fine on him who is negligent;
and in all that relates to the city they should have a care of
cleanliness, and not allow a private person to encroach upon any public
property either by buildings or excavations. further, they ought to
take care that the rains from heaven flow off easily, and of any other
matters which may have to be administered either within or without the
city. the guardians of the law shall pass any further enactments which
their experience may show to be necessary, and supply any other points
in which the law may be deficient. and now that these matters, and the
buildings about the agora, and the gymnasia, and places of instruction,
and theatres, are all ready and waiting for scholars and spectators,
let us proceed to the subjects which follow marriage in the order of
legislation.

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: assuming that marriages exist already, cleinias, the mode
of life during the year after marriage, before children are born, will
follow next in order. in what way bride and bridegroom ought to live in
a city which is to be superior to other cities, is a matter not at all
easy for us to determine. there have been many difficulties already,
but this will be the greatest of them, and the most disagreeable to the
many. still i cannot but say what appears to me to be right and true,
cleinias.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: he who imagines that he can give laws for the public conduct
of states, while he leaves the private life of citizens wholly to take
care of itself; who thinks that individuals may pass the day as they
please, and that there is no necessity of order in all things; he, i
say, who gives up the control of their private lives, and supposes that
they will conform to law in their common and public life, is making a
great mistake. why have i made this remark? why, because i am going to
enact that the bridegrooms should live at the common tables, just as
they did before marriage. this was a singularity when first enacted by
the legislator in your parts of the world, megillus and cleinias, as
i should suppose, on the occasion of some war or other similar danger,
which caused the passing of the law, and which would be likely to occur
in thinly-peopled places, and in times of pressure. but when men had
once tried and been accustomed to a common table, experience showed that
the institution greatly conduced to security; and in some such manner
the custom of having common tables arose among you.

cleinias: likely enough.

athenian: i said that there may have been singularity and danger in
imposing such a custom at first, but that now there is not the same
difficulty. there is, however, another institution which is the natural
sequel to this, and would be excellent, if it existed anywhere, but at
present it does not. the institution of which i am about to speak is not
easily described or executed; and would be like the legislator 'combing
wool into the fire,' as people say, or performing any other impossible
and useless feat.

cleinias: what is the cause, stranger, of this extreme hesitation?

athenian: you shall hear without any fruitless loss of time. that which
has law and order in a state is the cause of every good, but that
which is disordered or ill-ordered is often the ruin of that which is
well-ordered; and at this point the argument is now waiting. for with
you, cleinias and megillus, the common tables of men are, as i said, a
heaven-born and admirable institution, but you are mistaken in leaving
the women unregulated by law. they have no similar institution of public
tables in the light of day, and just that part of the human race
which is by nature prone to secrecy and stealth on account of their
weakness--i mean the female sex--has been left without regulation by
the legislator, which is a great mistake. and, in consequence of this
neglect, many things have grown lax among you, which might have been
far better, if they had been only regulated by law; for the neglect of
regulations about women may not only be regarded as a neglect of half
the entire matter (arist. pol.), but in proportion as woman's nature
is inferior to that of men in capacity for virtue, in that degree the
consequence of such neglect is more than twice as important. the careful
consideration of this matter, and the arranging and ordering on a
common principle of all our institutions relating both to men and women,
greatly conduces to the happiness of the state. but at present, such
is the unfortunate condition of mankind, that no man of sense will even
venture to speak of common tables in places and cities in which they
have never been established at all; and how can any one avoid being
utterly ridiculous, who attempts to compel women to show in public
how much they eat and drink? there is nothing at which the sex is more
likely to take offence. for women are accustomed to creep into dark
places, and when dragged out into the light they will exert their
utmost powers of resistance, and be far too much for the legislator. and
therefore, as i said before, in most places they will not endure to have
the truth spoken without raising a tremendous outcry, but in this state
perhaps they may. and if we may assume that our whole discussion about
the state has not been mere idle talk, i should like to prove to you,
if you will consent to listen, that this institution is good and proper;
but if you had rather not, i will refrain.

cleinias: there is nothing which we should both of us like better,
stranger, than to hear what you have to say.

athenian: very good; and you must not be surprised if i go back a
little, for we have plenty of leisure, and there is nothing to prevent
us from considering in every point of view the subject of law.

cleinias: true.

athenian: then let us return once more to what we were saying at first.
every man should understand that the human race either had no beginning
at all, and will never have an end, but always will be and has been; or
that it began an immense while ago.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: well, and have there not been constitutions and destructions
of states, and all sorts of pursuits both orderly and disorderly, and
diverse desires of meats and drinks always, and in all the world, and
all sorts of changes of the seasons in which animals may be expected to
have undergone innumerable transformations of themselves?

cleinias: no doubt.

athenian: and may we not suppose that vines appeared, which had
previously no existence, and also olives, and the gifts of demeter
and her daughter, of which one triptolemus was the minister, and that,
before these existed, animals took to devouring each other as they do
still?

cleinias: true.

athenian: again, the practice of men sacrificing one another still
exists among many nations; while, on the other hand, we hear of other
human beings who did not even venture to taste the flesh of a cow and
had no animal sacrifices, but only cakes and fruits dipped in honey,
and similar pure offerings, but no flesh of animals; from these they
abstained under the idea that they ought not to eat them, and might not
stain the altars of the gods with blood. for in those days men are said
to have lived a sort of orphic life, having the use of all lifeless
things, but abstaining from all living things.

cleinias: such has been the constant tradition, and is very likely true.

athenian: some one might say to us, what is the drift of all this?

cleinias: a very pertinent question, stranger.

athenian: and therefore i will endeavour, cleinias, if i can, to draw
the natural inference.

cleinias: proceed.

athenian: i see that among men all things depend upon three wants and
desires, of which the end is virtue, if they are rightly led by them, or
the opposite if wrongly. now these are eating and drinking, which begin
at birth--every animal has a natural desire for them, and is violently
excited, and rebels against him who says that he must not satisfy
all his pleasures and appetites, and get rid of all the corresponding
pains--and the third and greatest and sharpest want and desire breaks
out last, and is the fire of sexual lust, which kindles in men every
species of wantonness and madness. and these three disorders we must
endeavour to master by the three great principles of fear and law and
right reason; turning them away from that which is called pleasantest
to the best, using the muses and the gods who preside over contests to
extinguish their increase and influx.

but to return:--after marriage let us speak of the birth of children,
and after their birth of their nurture and education. in the course
of discussion the several laws will be perfected, and we shall at
last arrive at the common tables. whether such associations are to be
confined to men, or extended to women also, we shall see better when we
approach and take a nearer view of them; and we may then determine what
previous institutions are required and will have to precede them. as i
said before, we shall see them more in detail, and shall be better able
to lay down the laws which are proper or suited to them.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: let us keep in mind the words which have now been spoken; for
hereafter there may be need of them.

cleinias: what do you bid us keep in mind?

athenian: that which we comprehended under the three words--first,
eating, secondly, drinking, thirdly, the excitement of love.

cleinias: we shall be sure to remember, stranger.

athenian: very good. then let us now proceed to marriage, and teach
persons in what way they shall beget children, threatening them, if they
disobey, with the terrors of the law.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: the bride and bridegroom should consider that they are to
produce for the state the best and fairest specimens of children which
they can. now all men who are associated in any action always succeed
when they attend and give their mind to what they are doing, but when
they do not give their mind or have no mind, they fail; wherefore
let the bridegroom give his mind to the bride and to the begetting of
children, and the bride in like manner give her mind to the bridegroom,
and particularly at the time when their children are not yet born. and
let the women whom we have chosen be the overseers of such matters, and
let them in whatever number, large or small, and at whatever time the
magistrates may command, assemble every day in the temple of eileithyia
during a third part of the day, and being there assembled, let them
inform one another of any one whom they see, whether man or woman, of
those who are begetting children, disregarding the ordinances given at
the time when the nuptial sacrifices and ceremonies were performed. let
the begetting of children and the supervision of those who are begetting
them continue ten years and no longer, during the time when marriage is
fruitful. but if any continue without children up to this time, let them
take counsel with their kindred and with the women holding the office
of overseer and be divorced for their mutual benefit. if, however,
any dispute arises about what is proper and for the interest of either
party, they shall choose ten of the guardians of the law and abide
by their permission and appointment. the women who preside over
these matters shall enter into the houses of the young, and partly by
admonitions and partly by threats make them give over their folly and
error: if they persist, let the women go and tell the guardians of
the law, and the guardians shall prevent them. but if they too cannot
prevent them, they shall bring the matter before the people; and let
them write up their names and make oath that they cannot reform such and
such an one; and let him who is thus written up, if he cannot in a court
of law convict those who have inscribed his name, be deprived of the
privileges of a citizen in the following respects:--let him not go to
weddings nor to the thanksgivings after the birth of children; and if he
go, let any one who pleases strike him with impunity; and let the same
regulations hold about women: let not a woman be allowed to appear
abroad, or receive honour, or go to nuptial and birthday festivals, if
she in like manner be written up as acting disorderly and cannot obtain
a verdict. and if, when they themselves have done begetting children
according to the law, a man or woman have connexion with another man
or woman who are still begetting children, let the same penalties be
inflicted upon them as upon those who are still having a family; and
when the time for procreation has passed let the man or woman who
refrains in such matters be held in esteem, and let those who do not
refrain be held in the contrary of esteem--that is to say, disesteem.
now, if the greater part of mankind behave modestly, the enactments of
law may be left to slumber; but, if they are disorderly, the enactments
having been passed, let them be carried into execution. to every man the
first year is the beginning of life, and the time of birth ought to
be written down in the temples of their fathers as the beginning of
existence to every child, whether boy or girl. let every phratria have
inscribed on a whited wall the names of the successive archons by whom
the years are reckoned. and near to them let the living members of the
phratria be inscribed, and when they depart life let them be erased. the
limit of marriageable ages for a woman shall be from sixteen to twenty
years at the longest,--for a man, from thirty to thirty-five years; and
let a woman hold office at forty, and a man at thirty years. let a man
go out to war from twenty to sixty years, and for a woman, if there
appear any need to make use of her in military service, let the time of
service be after she shall have brought forth children up to fifty years
of age; and let regard be had to what is possible and suitable to each.




book vii.

and now, assuming children of both sexes to have been born, it will
be proper for us to consider, in the next place, their nurture and
education; this cannot be left altogether unnoticed, and yet may be
thought a subject fitted rather for precept and admonition than for
law. in private life there are many little things, not always apparent,
arising out of the pleasures and pains and desires of individuals, which
run counter to the intention of the legislator, and make the characters
of the citizens various and dissimilar:--this is an evil in states; for
by reason of their smallness and frequent occurrence, there would be an
unseemliness and want of propriety in making them penal by law; and if
made penal, they are the destruction of the written law because mankind
get the habit of frequently transgressing the law in small matters. the
result is that you cannot legislate about them, and still less can you
be silent. i speak somewhat darkly, but i shall endeavour also to bring
my wares into the light of day, for i acknowledge that at present there
is a want of clearness in what i am saying.

cleinias: very true.

athenian. am i not right in maintaining that a good education is that
which tends most to the improvement of mind and body?

cleinias: undoubtedly.

athenian: and nothing can be plainer than that the fairest bodies are
those which grow up from infancy in the best and straightest manner?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and do we not further observe that the first shoot of every
living thing is by far the greatest and fullest? many will even contend
that a man at twenty-five does not reach twice the height which he
attained at five.

cleinias: true.

athenian: well, and is not rapid growth without proper and abundant
exercise the source endless evils in the body?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: and the body should have the most exercise when it receives
most nourishment?

cleinias: but, stranger, are we to impose this great amount of exercise
upon newly-born infants?

athenian: nay, rather on the bodies of infants still unborn.

cleinias: what do you mean, my good sir? in the process of gestation?

athenian: exactly. i am not at all surprised that you have never
heard of this very peculiar sort of gymnastic applied to such little
creatures, which, although strange, i will endeavour to explain to you.

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: the practice is more easy for us to understand than for you,
by reason of certain amusements which are carried to excess by us at
athens. not only boys, but often older persons, are in the habit of
keeping quails and cocks (compare republic), which they train to fight
one another. and they are far from thinking that the contests in which
they stir them up to fight with one another are sufficient exercise;
for, in addition to this, they carry them about tucked beneath their
armpits, holding the smaller birds in their hands, the larger under
their arms, and go for a walk of a great many miles for the sake of
health, that is to say, not their own health, but the health of the
birds; whereby they prove to any intelligent person, that all bodies
are benefited by shakings and movements, when they are moved without
weariness, whether the motion proceeds from themselves, or is caused by
a swing, or at sea, or on horseback, or by other bodies in whatever way
moving, and that thus gaining the mastery over food and drink, they are
able to impart beauty and health and strength. but admitting all this,
what follows? shall we make a ridiculous law that the pregnant woman
shall walk about and fashion the embryo within as we fashion wax before
it hardens, and after birth swathe the infant for two years? suppose
that we compel nurses, under penalty of a legal fine, to be always
carrying the children somewhere or other, either to the temples, or into
the country, or to their relations' houses, until they are well able to
stand, and to take care that their limbs are not distorted by leaning
on them when they are too young (compare arist. pol.),--they should
continue to carry them until the infant has completed its third year;
the nurses should be strong, and there should be more than one of them.
shall these be our rules, and shall we impose a penalty for the neglect
of them? no, no; the penalty of which we were speaking will fall upon
our own heads more than enough.

cleinias: what penalty?

athenian: ridicule, and the difficulty of getting the feminine and
servant-like dispositions of the nurses to comply.

cleinias: then why was there any need to speak of the matter at all?

athenian: the reason is, that masters and freemen in states, when they
hear of it, are very likely to arrive at a true conviction that without
due regulation of private life in cities, stability in the laying down
of laws is hardly to be expected (compare republic); and he who makes
this reflection may himself adopt the laws just now mentioned, and,
adopting them, may order his house and state well and be happy.

cleinias: likely enough.

athenian: and therefore let us proceed with our legislation until we
have determined the exercises which are suited to the souls of young
children, in the same manner in which we have begun to go through the
rules relating to their bodies.

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: let us assume, then, as a first principle in relation both to
the body and soul of very young creatures, that nursing and moving about
by day and night is good for them all, and that the younger they are,
the more they will need it (compare arist. pol.); infants should live,
if that were possible, as if they were always rocking at sea. this
is the lesson which we may gather from the experience of nurses, and
likewise from the use of the remedy of motion in the rites of the
corybantes; for when mothers want their restless children to go to sleep
they do not employ rest, but, on the contrary, motion--rocking them in
their arms; nor do they give them silence, but they sing to them and lap
them in sweet strains; and the bacchic women are cured of their frenzy
in the same manner by the use of the dance and of music.

cleinias: well, stranger, and what is the reason of this?

athenian: the reason is obvious.

cleinias: what?

athenian: the affection both of the bacchantes and of the children is
an emotion of fear, which springs out of an evil habit of the soul. and
when some one applies external agitation to affections of this sort, the
motion coming from without gets the better of the terrible and violent
internal one, and produces a peace and calm in the soul, and quiets the
restless palpitation of the heart, which is a thing much to be desired,
sending the children to sleep, and making the bacchantes, although they
remain awake, to dance to the pipe with the help of the gods to whom
they offer acceptable sacrifices, and producing in them a sound mind,
which takes the place of their frenzy. and, to express what i mean in a
word, there is a good deal to be said in favour of this treatment.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: but if fear has such a power we ought to infer from these
facts, that every soul which from youth upward has been familiar with
fears, will be made more liable to fear (compare republic), and every
one will allow that this is the way to form a habit of cowardice and not
of courage.

cleinias: no doubt.

athenian: and, on the other hand, the habit of overcoming, from our
youth upwards, the fears and terrors which beset us, may be said to be
an exercise of courage.

cleinias: true.

athenian: and we may say that the use of exercise and motion in the
earliest years of life greatly contributes to create a part of virtue in
the soul.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: further, a cheerful temper, or the reverse, may be regarded as
having much to do with high spirit on the one hand, or with cowardice on
the other.

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: then now we must endeavour to show how and to what extent we
may, if we please, without difficulty implant either character in the
young.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: there is a common opinion, that luxury makes the disposition
of youth discontented and irascible and vehemently excited by trifles;
that on the other hand excessive and savage servitude makes men mean and
abject, and haters of their kind, and therefore makes them undesirable
associates.

cleinias: but how must the state educate those who do not as yet
understand the language of the country, and are therefore incapable of
appreciating any sort of instruction?

athenian: i will tell you how:--every animal that is born is wont to
utter some cry, and this is especially the case with man, and he is also
affected with the inclination to weep more than any other animal.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: do not nurses, when they want to know what an infant desires,
judge by these signs?--when anything is brought to the infant and he is
silent, then he is supposed to be pleased, but, when he weeps and cries
out, then he is not pleased. for tears and cries are the inauspicious
signs by which children show what they love and hate. now the time which
is thus spent is no less than three years, and is a very considerable
portion of life to be passed ill or well.

cleinias: true.

athenian: does not the discontented and ungracious nature appear to you
to be full of lamentations and sorrows more than a good man ought to be?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: well, but if during these three years every possible care were
taken that our nursling should have as little of sorrow and fear, and in
general of pain as was possible, might we not expect in early childhood
to make his soul more gentle and cheerful? (compare arist. pol.)

cleinias: to be sure, stranger--more especially if we could procure him
a variety of pleasures.

athenian: there i can no longer agree, cleinias: you amaze me. to bring
him up in such a way would be his utter ruin; for the beginning is
always the most critical part of education. let us see whether i am
right.

cleinias: proceed.

athenian: the point about which you and i differ is of great importance,
and i hope that you, megillus, will help to decide between us. for i
maintain that the true life should neither seek for pleasures, nor,
on the other hand, entirely avoid pains, but should embrace the middle
state (compare republic), which i just spoke of as gentle and benign,
and is a state which we by some divine presage and inspiration rightly
ascribe to god. now, i say, he among men, too, who would be divine
ought to pursue after this mean habit--he should not rush headlong into
pleasures, for he will not be free from pains; nor should we allow
any one, young or old, male or female, to be thus given any more than
ourselves, and least of all the newly-born infant, for in infancy more
than at any other time the character is engrained by habit. nay, more,
if i were not afraid of appearing to be ridiculous, i would say that a
woman during her year of pregnancy should of all women be most carefully
tended, and kept from violent or excessive pleasures and pains, and
should at that time cultivate gentleness and benevolence and kindness.

cleinias: you need not ask megillus, stranger, which of us has most
truly spoken; for i myself agree that all men ought to avoid the life
of unmingled pain or pleasure, and pursue always a middle course. and
having spoken well, may i add that you have been well answered?

athenian: very good, cleinias; and now let us all three consider a
further point.

cleinias: what is it?

athenian: that all the matters which we are now describing are commonly
called by the general name of unwritten customs, and what are termed
the laws of our ancestors are all of similar nature. and the reflection
which lately arose in our minds, that we can neither call these things
laws, nor yet leave them unmentioned, is justified; for they are the
bonds of the whole state, and come in between the written laws which
are or are hereafter to be laid down; they are just ancestral customs of
great antiquity, which, if they are rightly ordered and made habitual,
shield and preserve the previously existing written law; but if they
depart from right and fall into disorder, then they are like the props
of builders which slip away out of their place and cause a universal
ruin--one part drags another down, and the fair super-structure falls
because the old foundations are undermined. reflecting upon this,
cleinias, you ought to bind together the new state in every possible
way, omitting nothing, whether great or small, of what are called laws
or manners or pursuits, for by these means a city is bound together,
and all these things are only lasting when they depend upon one another;
and, therefore, we must not wonder if we find that many apparently
trifling customs or usages come pouring in and lengthening out our laws.

cleinias: very true: we are disposed to agree with you.

athenian: up to the age of three years, whether of boy or girl, if a
person strictly carries out our previous regulations and makes them a
principal aim, he will do much for the advantage of the young creatures.
but at three, four, five, and even six years the childish nature
will require sports; now is the time to get rid of self-will in him,
punishing him, but not so as to disgrace him. we were saying about
slaves, that we ought neither to add insult to punishment so as to anger
them, nor yet to leave them unpunished lest they become self-willed; and
a like rule is to be observed in the case of the free-born. children at
that age have certain natural modes of amusement which they find out for
themselves when they meet. and all the children who are between the
ages of three and six ought to meet at the temples of the villages, the
several families of a village uniting on one spot. the nurses are to see
that the children behave properly and orderly--they themselves and all
their companies are to be under the control of twelve matrons, one for
each company, who are annually selected to inspect them from the women
previously mentioned [i.e. the women who have authority over marriage],
whom the guardians of the law appoint. these matrons shall be chosen by
the women who have authority over marriage, one out of each tribe;
all are to be of the same age; and let each of them, as soon as she is
appointed, hold office and go to the temples every day, punishing all
offenders, male or female, who are slaves or strangers, by the help of
some of the public slaves; but if any citizen disputes the punishment,
let her bring him before the wardens of the city; or, if there be no
dispute, let her punish him herself. after the age of six years the time
has arrived for the separation of the sexes--let boys live with boys,
and girls in like manner with girls. now they must begin to learn--the
boys going to teachers of horsemanship and the use of the bow, the
javelin, and sling, and the girls too, if they do not object, at any
rate until they know how to manage these weapons, and especially how to
handle heavy arms; for i may note, that the practice which now prevails
is almost universally misunderstood.

cleinias: in what respect?

athenian: in that the right and left hand are supposed to be by nature
differently suited for our various uses of them; whereas no difference
is found in the use of the feet and the lower limbs; but in the use of
the hands we are, as it were, maimed by the folly of nurses and mothers;
for although our several limbs are by nature balanced, we create
a difference in them by bad habit. in some cases this is of no
consequence, as, for example, when we hold the lyre in the left hand,
and the plectrum in the right, but it is downright folly to make the
same distinction in other cases. the custom of the scythians proves our
error; for they not only hold the bow from them with the left hand and
draw the arrow to them with their right, but use either hand for both
purposes. and there are many similar examples in charioteering and other
things, from which we may learn that those who make the left side weaker
than the right act contrary to nature. in the case of the plectrum,
which is of horn only, and similar instruments, as i was saying, it
is of no consequence, but makes a great difference, and may be of very
great importance to the warrior who has to use iron weapons, bows and
javelins, and the like; above all, when in heavy armour, he has to fight
against heavy armour. and there is a very great difference between one
who has learnt and one who has not, and between one who has been trained
in gymnastic exercises and one who has not been. for as he who is
perfectly skilled in the pancratium or boxing or wrestling, is not
unable to fight from his left side, and does not limp and draggle
in confusion when his opponent makes him change his position, so in
heavy-armed fighting, and in all other things, if i am not mistaken, the
like holds--he who has these double powers of attack and defence ought
not in any case to leave them either unused or untrained, if he can
help; and if a person had the nature of geryon or briareus he ought
to be able with his hundred hands to throw a hundred darts. now, the
magistrates, male and female, should see to all these things, the women
superintending the nursing and amusements of the children, and the men
superintending their education, that all of them, boys and girls alike,
may be sound hand and foot, and may not, if they can help, spoil the
gifts of nature by bad habits.

education has two branches--one of gymnastic, which is concerned with
the body, and the other of music, which is designed for the improvement
of the soul. and gymnastic has also two branches--dancing and wrestling;
and one sort of dancing imitates musical recitation, and aims at
preserving dignity and freedom, the other aims at producing health,
agility, and beauty in the limbs and parts of the body, giving the
proper flexion and extension to each of them, a harmonious motion being
diffused everywhere, and forming a suitable accompaniment to the dance.
as regards wrestling, the tricks which antaeus and cercyon devised in
their systems out of a vain spirit of competition, or the tricks of
boxing which epeius or amycus invented, are useless and unsuitable for
war, and do not deserve to have much said about them; but the art of
wrestling erect and keeping free the neck and hands and sides, working
with energy and constancy, with a composed strength, for the sake of
health--these are always useful, and are not to be neglected, but to
be enjoined alike on masters and scholars, when we reach that part
of legislation; and we will desire the one to give their instructions
freely, and the others to receive them thankfully. nor, again, must we
omit suitable imitations of war in our choruses; here in crete you have
the armed dances of the curetes, and the lacedaemonians have those of
the dioscuri. and our virgin lady, delighting in the amusement of the
dance, thought it not fit to amuse herself with empty hands; she must be
clothed in a complete suit of armour, and in this attire go through
the dance; and youths and maidens should in every respect imitate her,
esteeming highly the favour of the goddess, both with a view to the
necessities of war, and to festive occasions: it will be right also for
the boys, until such time as they go out to war, to make processions and
supplications to all the gods in goodly array, armed and on horseback,
in dances and marches, fast or slow, offering up prayers to the gods
and to the sons of gods; and also engaging in contests and preludes of
contests, if at all, with these objects. for these sorts of exercises,
and no others, are useful both in peace and war, and are beneficial
alike to states and to private houses. but other labours and sports and
exercises of the body are unworthy of freemen, o megillus and cleinias.

i have now completely described the kind of gymnastic which i said
at first ought to be described; if you know of any better, will you
communicate your thoughts?

cleinias: it is not easy, stranger, to put aside these principles of
gymnastic and wrestling and to enunciate better ones.

athenian: now we must say what has yet to be said about the gifts of the
muses and of apollo: before, we fancied that we had said all, and that
gymnastic alone remained; but now we see clearly what points have been
omitted, and should be first proclaimed; of these, then, let us proceed
to speak.

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: let me tell you once more--although you have heard me say the
same before--that caution must be always exercised, both by the speaker
and by the hearer, about anything that is very singular and unusual. for
my tale is one which many a man would be afraid to tell, and yet i have
a confidence which makes me go on.

cleinias: what have you to say, stranger?

athenian: i say that in states generally no one has observed that the
plays of childhood have a great deal to do with the permanence or want
of permanence in legislation. for when plays are ordered with a view to
children having the same plays, and amusing themselves after the same
manner, and finding delight in the same playthings, the more solemn
institutions of the state are allowed to remain undisturbed. whereas
if sports are disturbed, and innovations are made in them, and they
constantly change, and the young never speak of their having the same
likings, or the same established notions of good and bad taste, either
in the bearing of their bodies or in their dress, but he who devises
something new and out of the way in figures and colours and the like is
held in special honour, we may truly say that no greater evil can happen
in a state; for he who changes the sports is secretly changing the
manners of the young, and making the old to be dishonoured among them
and the new to be honoured. and i affirm that there is nothing which is
a greater injury to all states than saying or thinking thus. will you
hear me tell how great i deem the evil to be?

cleinias: you mean the evil of blaming antiquity in states?

athenian: exactly.

cleinias: if you are speaking of that, you will find in us hearers
who are disposed to receive what you say not unfavourably but most
favourably.

athenian: i should expect so.

cleinias: proceed.

athenian: well, then, let us give all the greater heed to one another's
words. the argument affirms that any change whatever except from evil
is the most dangerous of all things; this is true in the case of the
seasons and of the winds, in the management of our bodies and the habits
of our minds--true of all things except, as i said before, of the bad.
he who looks at the constitution of individuals accustomed to eat any
sort of meat, or drink any drink, or to do any work which they can get,
may see that they are at first disordered by them, but afterwards, as
time goes on, their bodies grow adapted to them, and they learn to know
and like variety, and have good health and enjoyment of life; and if
ever afterwards they are confined again to a superior diet, at first
they are troubled with disorders, and with difficulty become habituated
to their new food. a similar principle we may imagine to hold good about
the minds of men and the natures of their souls. for when they have
been brought up in certain laws, which by some divine providence have
remained unchanged during long ages, so that no one has any memory or
tradition of their ever having been otherwise than they are, then every
one is afraid and ashamed to change that which is established. the
legislator must somehow find a way of implanting this reverence for
antiquity, and i would propose the following way: people are apt to
fancy, as i was saying before, that when the plays of children are
altered they are merely plays, not seeing that the most serious and
detrimental consequences arise out of the change; and they readily
comply with the child's wishes instead of deterring him, not considering
that these children who make innovations in their games, when they grow
up to be men, will be different from the last generation of children,
and, being different, will desire a different sort of life, and under
the influence of this desire will want other institutions and laws; and
no one of them reflects that there will follow what i just now called
the greatest of evils to states. changes in bodily fashions are no such
serious evils, but frequent changes in the praise and censure of manners
are the greatest of evils, and require the utmost prevision.

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: and now do we still hold to our former assertion, that rhythms
and music in general are imitations of good and evil characters in men?
what say you?

cleinias: that is the only doctrine which we can admit.

athenian: must we not, then, try in every possible way to prevent our
youth from even desiring to imitate new modes either in dance or song?
nor must any one be allowed to offer them varieties of pleasures.

cleinias: most true.

athenian: can any of us imagine a better mode of effecting this object
than that of the egyptians?

cleinias: what is their method?

athenian: to consecrate every sort of dance or melody. first we should
ordain festivals--calculating for the year what they ought to be, and
at what time, and in honour of what gods, sons of gods, and heroes they
ought to be celebrated; and, in the next place, what hymns ought to
be sung at the several sacrifices, and with what dances the particular
festival is to be honoured. this has to be arranged at first by certain
persons, and, when arranged, the whole assembly of the citizens are to
offer sacrifices and libations to the fates and all the other gods, and
to consecrate the several odes to gods and heroes: and if any one
offers any other hymns or dances to any one of the gods, the priests
and priestesses, acting in concert with the guardians of the law, shall,
with the sanction of religion and the law, exclude him, and he who is
excluded, if he do not submit, shall be liable all his life long to have
a suit of impiety brought against him by any one who likes.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: in the consideration of this subject, let us remember what is
due to ourselves.

cleinias: to what are you referring?

athenian: i mean that any young man, and much more any old one, when he
sees or hears anything strange or unaccustomed, does not at once run to
embrace the paradox, but he stands considering, like a person who is at
a place where three paths meet, and does not very well know his way--he
may be alone or he may be walking with others, and he will say to
himself and them, 'which is the way?' and will not move forward until he
is satisfied that he is going right. and this is what we must do in the
present instance: a strange discussion on the subject of law has arisen,
which requires the utmost consideration, and we should not at our age be
too ready to speak about such great matters, or be confident that we can
say anything certain all in a moment.

cleinias: most true.

athenian: then we will allow time for reflection, and decide when we
have given the subject sufficient consideration. but that we may not
be hindered from completing the natural arrangement of our laws, let us
proceed to the conclusion of them in due order; for very possibly, if
god will, the exposition of them, when completed, may throw light on our
present perplexity.

cleinias: excellent, stranger; let us do as you propose.

athenian: let us then affirm the paradox that strains of music are our
laws (nomoi), and this latter being the name which the ancients gave
to lyric songs, they probably would not have very much objected to our
proposed application of the word. some one, either asleep or awake, must
have had a dreamy suspicion of their nature. and let our decree be as
follows: no one in singing or dancing shall offend against public and
consecrated models, and the general fashion among the youth, any more
than he would offend against any other law. and he who observes this law
shall be blameless; but he who is disobedient, as i was saying, shall
be punished by the guardians of the laws, and by the priests and
priestesses. suppose that we imagine this to be our law.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: can any one who makes such laws escape ridicule? let us see.
i think that our only safety will be in first framing certain models for
composers. one of these models shall be as follows: if when a sacrifice
is going on, and the victims are being burnt according to law--if, i
say, any one who may be a son or brother, standing by another at the
altar and over the victims, horribly blasphemes, will not his words
inspire despondency and evil omens and forebodings in the mind of his
father and of his other kinsmen?

cleinias: of course.

athenian: and this is just what takes place in almost all our cities. a
magistrate offers a public sacrifice, and there come in not one but many
choruses, who take up a position a little way from the altar, and from
time to time pour forth all sorts of horrible blasphemies on the sacred
rites, exciting the souls of the audience with words and rhythms and
melodies most sorrowful to hear; and he who at the moment when the city
is offering sacrifice makes the citizens weep most, carries away the
palm of victory. now, ought we not to forbid such strains as these? and
if ever our citizens must hear such lamentations, then on some unblest
and inauspicious day let there be choruses of foreign and hired
minstrels, like those hirelings who accompany the departed at funerals
with barbarous carian chants. that is the sort of thing which will be
appropriate if we have such strains at all; and let the apparel of the
singers be, not circlets and ornaments of gold, but the reverse. enough
of all this. i will simply ask once more whether we shall lay down as
one of our principles of song--

cleinias: what?

athenian: that we should avoid every word of evil omen; let that kind of
song which is of good omen be heard everywhere and always in our state.
i need hardly ask again, but shall assume that you agree with me.

cleinias: by all means; that law is approved by the suffrages of us all.

athenian: but what shall be our next musical law or type? ought not
prayers to be offered up to the gods when we sacrifice?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and our third law, if i am not mistaken, will be to the effect
that our poets, understanding prayers to be requests which we make to
the gods, will take especial heed that they do not by mistake ask
for evil instead of good. to make such a prayer would surely be too
ridiculous.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: were we not a little while ago quite convinced that no silver
or golden plutus should dwell in our state?

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: and what has it been the object of our argument to show? did
we not imply that the poets are not always quite capable of knowing what
is good or evil? and if one of them utters a mistaken prayer in song or
words, he will make our citizens pray for the opposite of what is good
in matters of the highest import; than which, as i was saying, there can
be few greater mistakes. shall we then propose as one of our laws and
models relating to the muses--

cleinias: what? will you explain the law more precisely?

athenian: shall we make a law that the poet shall compose nothing
contrary to the ideas of the lawful, or just, or beautiful, or good,
which are allowed in the state? nor shall he be permitted to communicate
his compositions to any private individuals, until he shall have shown
them to the appointed judges and the guardians of the law, and they
are satisfied with them. as to the persons whom we appoint to be our
legislators about music and as to the director of education, these have
been already indicated. once more then, as i have asked more than once,
shall this be our third law, and type, and model--what do you say?

cleinias: let it be so, by all means.

athenian: then it will be proper to have hymns and praises of the gods,
intermingled with prayers; and after the gods prayers and praises should
be offered in like manner to demigods and heroes, suitable to their
several characters.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: in the next place there will be no objection to a law, that
citizens who are departed and have done good and energetic deeds, either
with their souls or with their bodies, and have been obedient to the
laws, should receive eulogies; this will be very fitting.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: but to honour with hymns and panegyrics those who are still
alive is not safe; a man should run his course, and make a fair ending,
and then we will praise him; and let praise be given equally to women
as well as men who have been distinguished in virtue. the order of
songs and dances shall be as follows: there are many ancient musical
compositions and dances which are excellent, and from these the
newly-founded city may freely select what is proper and suitable; and
they shall choose judges of not less than fifty years of age, who shall
make the selection, and any of the old poems which they deem sufficient
they shall include; any that are deficient or altogether unsuitable,
they shall either utterly throw aside, or examine and amend, taking
into their counsel poets and musicians, and making use of their poetical
genius; but explaining to them the wishes of the legislator in order
that they may regulate dancing, music, and all choral strains, according
to the mind of the judges; and not allowing them to indulge, except
in some few matters, their individual pleasures and fancies. now the
irregular strain of music is always made ten thousand times better by
attaining to law and order, and rejecting the honeyed muse--not however
that we mean wholly to exclude pleasure, which is the characteristic
of all music. and if a man be brought up from childhood to the age of
discretion and maturity in the use of the orderly and severe music,
when he hears the opposite he detests it, and calls it illiberal; but
if trained in the sweet and vulgar music, he deems the severer kind cold
and displeasing. so that, as i was saying before, while he who hears
them gains no more pleasure from the one than from the other, the one
has the advantage of making those who are trained in it better men,
whereas the other makes them worse.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: again, we must distinguish and determine on some general
principle what songs are suitable to women, and what to men, and must
assign to them their proper melodies and rhythms. it is shocking for a
whole harmony to be inharmonical, or for a rhythm to be unrhythmical,
and this will happen when the melody is inappropriate to them. and
therefore the legislator must assign to these also their forms. now both
sexes have melodies and rhythms which of necessity belong to them; and
those of women are clearly enough indicated by their natural difference.
the grand, and that which tends to courage, may be fairly called manly;
but that which inclines to moderation and temperance, may be declared
both in law and in ordinary speech to be the more womanly quality. this,
then, will be the general order of them.

let us now speak of the manner of teaching and imparting them, and the
persons to whom, and the time when, they are severally to be imparted.
as the shipwright first lays down the lines of the keel, and thus, as
it were, draws the ship in outline, so do i seek to distinguish the
patterns of life, and lay down their keels according to the nature of
different men's souls; seeking truly to consider by what means, and in
what ways, we may go through the voyage of life best. now human affairs
are hardly worth considering in earnest, and yet we must be in earnest
about them--a sad necessity constrains us. and having got thus far,
there will be a fitness in our completing the matter, if we can only
find some suitable method of doing so. but what do i mean? some one may
ask this very question, and quite rightly, too.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: i say that about serious matters a man should be serious, and
about a matter which is not serious he should not be serious; and that
god is the natural and worthy object of our most serious and blessed
endeavours, for man, as i said before, is made to be the plaything of
god, and this, truly considered, is the best of him; wherefore also
every man and woman should walk seriously, and pass life in the noblest
of pastimes, and be of another mind from what they are at present.

cleinias: in what respect?

athenian: at present they think that their serious pursuits should be
for the sake of their sports, for they deem war a serious pursuit, which
must be managed well for the sake of peace; but the truth is, that
there neither is, nor has been, nor ever will be, either amusement
or instruction in any degree worth speaking of in war, which is
nevertheless deemed by us to be the most serious of our pursuits. and
therefore, as we say, every one of us should live the life of peace as
long and as well as he can. and what is the right way of living? are
we to live in sports always? if so, in what kind of sports? we ought to
live sacrificing, and singing, and dancing, and then a man will be able
to propitiate the gods, and to defend himself against his enemies and
conquer them in battle. the type of song or dance by which he will
propitiate them has been described, and the paths along which he is to
proceed have been cut for him. he will go forward in the spirit of the
poet:

'telemachus, some things thou wilt thyself find in thy heart, but other
things god will suggest; for i deem that thou wast not born or brought
up without the will of the gods.'

and this ought to be the view of our alumni; they ought to think that
what has been said is enough for them, and that any other things their
genius and god will suggest to them--he will tell them to whom, and
when, and to what gods severally they are to sacrifice and perform
dances, and how they may propitiate the deities, and live according to
the appointment of nature; being for the most part puppets, but having
some little share of reality.

megillus: you have a low opinion of mankind, stranger.

athenian: nay, megillus, be not amazed, but forgive me: i was comparing
them with the gods; and under that feeling i spoke. let us grant, if you
wish, that the human race is not to be despised, but is worthy of some
consideration.

next follow the buildings for gymnasia and schools open to all; these
are to be in three places in the midst of the city; and outside the city
and in the surrounding country, also in three places, there shall be
schools for horse exercise, and large grounds arranged with a view to
archery and the throwing of missiles, at which young men may learn and
practise. of these mention has already been made; and if the mention be
not sufficiently explicit, let us speak further of them and embody them
in laws. in these several schools let there be dwellings for teachers,
who shall be brought from foreign parts by pay, and let them teach those
who attend the schools the art of war and the art of music, and the
children shall come not only if their parents please, but if they do not
please; there shall be compulsory education, as the saying is, of all
and sundry, as far as this is possible; and the pupils shall be regarded
as belonging to the state rather than to their parents. my law would
apply to females as well as males; they shall both go through the same
exercises. i assert without fear of contradiction that gymnastic and
horsemanship are as suitable to women as to men. of the truth of this
i am persuaded from ancient tradition, and at the present day there are
said to be countless myriads of women in the neighbourhood of the black
sea, called sauromatides, who not only ride on horseback like men, but
have enjoined upon them the use of bows and other weapons equally
with the men. and i further affirm, that if these things are possible,
nothing can be more absurd than the practice which prevails in our own
country, of men and women not following the same pursuits with all
their strength and with one mind, for thus the state, instead of being
a whole, is reduced to a half, but has the same imposts to pay and
the same toils to undergo; and what can be a greater mistake for any
legislator to make than this?

cleinias: very true; yet much of what has been asserted by us, stranger,
is contrary to the custom of states; still, in saying that the discourse
should be allowed to proceed, and that when the discussion is completed,
we should choose what seems best, you spoke very properly, and i now
feel compunction for what i have said. tell me, then, what you would
next wish to say.

athenian: i should wish to say, cleinias, as i said before, that if the
possibility of these things were not sufficiently proven in fact, then
there might be an objection to the argument, but the fact being as
i have said, he who rejects the law must find some other ground of
objection; and, failing this, our exhortation will still hold good,
nor will any one deny that women ought to share as far as possible in
education and in other ways with men. for consider; if women do not
share in their whole life with men, then they must have some other order
of life.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and what arrangement of life to be found anywhere is
preferable to this community which we are now assigning to them? shall
we prefer that which is adopted by the thracians and many other races
who use their women to till the ground and to be shepherds of their
herds and flocks, and to minister to them like slaves? or shall we do
as we and people in our part of the world do--getting together, as the
phrase is, all our goods and chattels into one dwelling, we entrust them
to our women, who are the stewards of them, and who also preside over
the shuttles and the whole art of spinning? or shall we take a middle
course, as in lacedaemon, megillus--letting the girls share in gymnastic
and music, while the grown-up women, no longer employed in spinning
wool, are hard at work weaving the web of life, which will be no cheap
or mean employment, and in the duty of serving and taking care of the
household and bringing up the children, in which they will observe a
sort of mean, not participating in the toils of war; and if there were
any necessity that they should fight for their city and families, unlike
the amazons, they would be unable to take part in archery or any other
skilled use of missiles, nor could they, after the example of the
goddess, carry shield or spear, or stand up nobly for their country when
it was being destroyed, and strike terror into their enemies, if only
because they were seen in regular order? living as they do, they would
never dare at all to imitate the sauromatides, who, when compared with
ordinary women, would appear to be like men. let him who will, praise
your legislators, but i must say what i think. the legislator ought to
be whole and perfect, and not half a man only; he ought not to let the
female sex live softly and waste money and have no order of life, while
he takes the utmost care of the male sex, and leaves half of life only
blest with happiness, when he might have made the whole state happy.

megillus: what shall we do, cleinias? shall we allow a stranger to run
down sparta in this fashion?

cleinias: yes; for as we have given him liberty of speech we must let
him go on until we have perfected the work of legislation.

megillus: very true.

athenian: then now i may proceed?

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: what will be the manner of life among men who may be supposed
to have their food and clothing provided for them in moderation, and who
have entrusted the practice of the arts to others, and whose husbandry
committed to slaves paying a part of the produce, brings them a return
sufficient for men living temperately; who, moreover, have common tables
in which the men are placed apart, and near them are the common tables
of their families, of their daughters and mothers, which day by day,
the officers, male and female, are to inspect--they shall see to the
behaviour of the company, and so dismiss them; after which the presiding
magistrate and his attendants shall honour with libations those gods to
whom that day and night are dedicated, and then go home? to men whose
lives are thus ordered, is there no work remaining to be done which is
necessary and fitting, but shall each one of them live fattening like a
beast? such a life is neither just nor honourable, nor can he who lives
it fail of meeting his due; and the due reward of the idle fatted beast
is that he should be torn in pieces by some other valiant beast whose
fatness is worn down by brave deeds and toil. these regulations, if we
duly consider them, will never be exactly carried into execution under
present circumstances, nor as long as women and children and houses and
all other things are the private property of individuals; but if we can
attain the second-best form of polity, we shall be very well off. and
to men living under this second polity there remains a work to be
accomplished which is far from being small or insignificant, but is the
greatest of all works, and ordained by the appointment of righteous law.
for the life which may be truly said to be concerned with the virtue of
body and soul is twice, or more than twice, as full of toil and trouble
as the pursuit after pythian and olympic victories, which debars a
man from every employment of life. for there ought to be no bye-work
interfering with the greater work of providing the necessary exercise
and nourishment for the body, and instruction and education for the
soul. night and day are not long enough for the accomplishment of their
perfection and consummation; and therefore to this end all freemen ought
to arrange the way in which they will spend their time during the whole
course of the day, from morning till evening and from evening till the
morning of the next sunrise. there may seem to be some impropriety
in the legislator determining minutely the numberless details of the
management of the house, including such particulars as the duty of
wakefulness in those who are to be perpetual watchmen of the whole city;
for that any citizen should continue during the whole of any night in
sleep, instead of being seen by all his servants, always the first to
awake and get up--this, whether the regulation is to be called a law or
only a practice, should be deemed base and unworthy of a freeman; also
that the mistress of the house should be awakened by her hand-maidens
instead of herself first awakening them, is what the slaves, male and
female, and the serving-boys, and, if that were possible, everybody and
everything in the house should regard as base. if they rise early, they
may all of them do much of their public and of their household business,
as magistrates in the city, and masters and mistresses in their private
houses, before the sun is up. much sleep is not required by nature,
either for our souls or bodies, or for the actions which they perform.
for no one who is asleep is good for anything, any more than if he were
dead; but he of us who has the most regard for life and reason keeps
awake as long as he can, reserving only so much time for sleep as is
expedient for health; and much sleep is not required, if the habit of
moderation be once rightly formed. magistrates in states who keep awake
at night are terrible to the bad, whether enemies or citizens, and are
honoured and reverenced by the just and temperate, and are useful to
themselves and to the whole state.

a night which is passed in such a manner, in addition to all the
above-mentioned advantages, infuses a sort of courage into the minds of
the citizens. when the day breaks, the time has arrived for youth to go
to their schoolmasters. now neither sheep nor any other animals can live
without a shepherd, nor can children be left without tutors, or slaves
without masters. and of all animals the boy is the most unmanageable,
inasmuch as he has the fountain of reason in him not yet regulated;
he is the most insidious, sharp-witted, and insubordinate of animals.
wherefore he must be bound with many bridles; in the first place, when
he gets away from mothers and nurses, he must be under the management
of tutors on account of his childishness and foolishness; then, again,
being a freeman, he must be controlled by teachers, no matter what they
teach, and by studies; but he is also a slave, and in that regard
any freeman who comes in his way may punish him and his tutor and his
instructor, if any of them does anything wrong; and he who comes across
him and does not inflict upon him the punishment which he deserves,
shall incur the greatest disgrace; and let the guardian of the law, who
is the director of education, see to him who coming in the way of the
offences which we have mentioned, does not chastise them when he ought,
or chastises them in a way which he ought not; let him keep a sharp
look-out, and take especial care of the training of our children,
directing their natures, and always turning them to good according to
the law.

but how can our law sufficiently train the director of education
himself; for as yet all has been imperfect, and nothing has been said
either clear or satisfactory? now, as far as possible, the law ought
to leave nothing to him, but to explain everything, that he may be
an interpreter and tutor to others. about dances and music and choral
strains, i have already spoken both as to the character of the selection
of them, and the manner in which they are to be amended and consecrated.
but we have not as yet spoken, o illustrious guardian of education,
of the manner in which your pupils are to use those strains which are
written in prose, although you have been informed what martial strains
they are to learn and practise; what relates in the first place to the
learning of letters, and secondly, to the lyre, and also to calculation,
which, as we were saying, is needful for them all to learn, and any
other things which are required with a view to war and the management of
house and city, and, looking to the same object, what is useful in the
revolutions of the heavenly bodies--the stars and sun and moon, and
the various regulations about these matters which are necessary for the
whole state--i am speaking of the arrangements of days in periods of
months, and of months in years, which are to be observed, in order that
seasons and sacrifices and festivals may have their regular and natural
order, and keep the city alive and awake, the gods receiving the honours
due to them, and men having a better understanding about them: all these
things, o my friend, have not yet been sufficiently declared to you by
the legislator. attend, then, to what i am now going to say: we were
telling you, in the first place, that you were not sufficiently informed
about letters, and the objection was to this effect--that you were never
told whether he who was meant to be a respectable citizen should apply
himself in detail to that sort of learning, or not apply himself at all;
and the same remark holds good of the study of the lyre. but now we say
that he ought to attend to them. a fair time for a boy of ten years old
to spend in letters is three years; the age of thirteen is the proper
time for him to begin to handle the lyre, and he may continue at this
for another three years, neither more nor less, and whether his father
or himself like or dislike the study, he is not to be allowed to spend
more or less time in learning music than the law allows. and let him who
disobeys the law be deprived of those youthful honours of which we shall
hereafter speak. hear, however, first of all, what the young ought to
learn in the early years of life, and what their instructors ought to
teach them. they ought to be occupied with their letters until they
are able to read and write; but the acquisition of perfect beauty or
quickness in writing, if nature has not stimulated them to acquire these
accomplishments in the given number of years, they should let alone. and
as to the learning of compositions committed to writing which are not
set to the lyre, whether metrical or without rhythmical divisions,
compositions in prose, as they are termed, having no rhythm or
harmony--seeing how dangerous are the writings handed down to us by
many writers of this class--what will you do with them, o most excellent
guardians of the law? or how can the lawgiver rightly direct you about
them? i believe that he will be in great difficulty.

cleinias: what troubles you, stranger? and why are you so perplexed in
your mind?

athenian: you naturally ask, cleinias, and to you and megillus, who are
my partners in the work of legislation, i must state the more difficult
as well as the easier parts of the task.

cleinias: to what do you refer in this instance?

athenian: i will tell you. there is a difficulty in opposing many
myriads of mouths.

cleinias: well, and have we not already opposed the popular voice in
many important enactments?

athenian: that is quite true; and you mean to imply that the road which
we are taking may be disagreeable to some but is agreeable to as many
others, or if not to as many, at any rate to persons not inferior to
the others, and in company with them you bid me, at whatever risk,
to proceed along the path of legislation which has opened out of our
present discourse, and to be of good cheer, and not to faint.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and i do not faint; i say, indeed, that we have a great many
poets writing in hexameter, trimeter, and all sorts of measures--some
who are serious, others who aim only at raising a laugh--and all mankind
declare that the youth who are rightly educated should be brought up in
them and saturated with them; some insist that they should be constantly
hearing them read aloud, and always learning them, so as to get by heart
entire poets; while others select choice passages and long speeches,
and make compendiums of them, saying that these ought to be committed to
memory, if a man is to be made good and wise by experience and learning
of many things. and you want me now to tell them plainly in what they
are right and in what they are wrong.

cleinias: yes, i do.

athenian: but how can i in one word rightly comprehend all of them? i
am of opinion, and, if i am not mistaken, there is a general agreement,
that every one of these poets has said many things well and many things
the reverse of well; and if this be true, then i do affirm that much
learning is dangerous to youth.

cleinias: how would you advise the guardian of the law to act?

athenian: in what respect?

cleinias: i mean to what pattern should he look as his guide in
permitting the young to learn some things and forbidding them to learn
others. do not shrink from answering.

athenian: my good cleinias, i rather think that i am fortunate.

cleinias: how so?

athenian: i think that i am not wholly in want of a pattern, for when i
consider the words which we have spoken from early dawn until now, and
which, as i believe, have been inspired by heaven, they appear to me to
be quite like a poem. when i reflected upon all these words of ours,
i naturally felt pleasure, for of all the discourses which i have ever
learnt or heard, either in poetry or prose, this seemed to me to be the
justest, and most suitable for young men to hear; i cannot imagine any
better pattern than this which the guardian of the law who is also the
director of education can have. he cannot do better than advise the
teachers to teach the young these words and any which are of a like
nature, if he should happen to find them, either in poetry or prose, or
if he come across unwritten discourses akin to ours, he should certainly
preserve them, and commit them to writing. and, first of all, he shall
constrain the teachers themselves to learn and approve them, and any of
them who will not, shall not be employed by him, but those whom he finds
agreeing in his judgment, he shall make use of and shall commit to them
the instruction and education of youth. and here and on this wise let my
fanciful tale about letters and teachers of letters come to an end.

cleinias: i do not think, stranger, that we have wandered out of the
proposed limits of the argument; but whether we are right or not in our
whole conception, i cannot be very certain.

athenian: the truth, cleinias, may be expected to become clearer when,
as we have often said, we arrive at the end of the whole discussion
about laws.

cleinias: yes.

athenian: and now that we have done with the teacher of letters, the
teacher of the lyre has to receive orders from us.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: i think that we have only to recollect our previous
discussions, and we shall be able to give suitable regulations touching
all this part of instruction and education to the teachers of the lyre.

cleinias: to what do you refer?

athenian: we were saying, if i remember rightly, that the sixty
years old choristers of dionysus were to be specially quick in their
perceptions of rhythm and musical composition, that they might be able
to distinguish good and bad imitation, that is to say, the imitation of
the good or bad soul when under the influence of passion, rejecting the
one and displaying the other in hymns and songs, charming the souls
of youth, and inviting them to follow and attain virtue by the way of
imitation.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and with this view the teacher and the learner ought to use
the sounds of the lyre, because its notes are pure, the player who
teaches and his pupil rendering note for note in unison; but complexity,
and variation of notes, when the strings give one sound and the poet or
composer of the melody gives another--also when they make concords and
harmonies in which lesser and greater intervals, slow and quick, or
high and low notes, are combined--or, again, when they make complex
variations of rhythms, which they adapt to the notes of the lyre--all
that sort of thing is not suited to those who have to acquire speedy and
useful knowledge of music in three years; for opposite principles are
confusing, and create a difficulty in learning, and our young men should
learn quickly, and their mere necessary acquirements are not few or
trifling, as will be shown in due course. let the director of education
attend to the principles concerning music which we are laying down. as
to the songs and words themselves which the masters of choruses are to
teach and the character of them, they have been already described by us,
and are the same which, when consecrated and adapted to the different
festivals, we said were to benefit cities by affording them an innocent
amusement.

cleinias: that, again, is true.

athenian: then let him who has been elected a director of music receive
these rules from us as containing the very truth; and may he prosper in
his office! let us now proceed to lay down other rules in addition to
the preceding about dancing and gymnastic exercise in general. having
said what remained to be said about the teaching of music, let us speak
in like manner about gymnastic. for boys and girls ought to learn to
dance and practise gymnastic exercises--ought they not?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: then the boys ought to have dancing masters, and the girls
dancing mistresses to exercise them.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: then once more let us summon him who has the chief concern
in the business, the superintendent of youth [i.e. the director of
education]; he will have plenty to do, if he is to have the charge of
music and gymnastic.

cleinias: but how will an old man be able to attend to such great
charges?

athenian: o my friend, there will be no difficulty, for the law has
already given and will give him permission to select as his assistants
in this charge any citizens, male or female, whom he desires; and he
will know whom he ought to choose, and will be anxious not to make a
mistake, from a due sense of responsibility, and from a consciousness of
the importance of his office, and also because he will consider that
if young men have been and are well brought up, then all things go
swimmingly, but if not, it is not meet to say, nor do we say, what will
follow, lest the regarders of omens should take alarm about our
infant state. many things have been said by us about dancing and about
gymnastic movements in general; for we include under gymnastics all
military exercises, such as archery, and all hurling of weapons, and the
use of the light shield, and all fighting with heavy arms, and military
evolutions, and movements of armies, and encampings, and all that
relates to horsemanship. of all these things there ought to be public
teachers, receiving pay from the state, and their pupils should be the
men and boys in the state, and also the girls and women, who are to know
all these things. while they are yet girls they should have practised
dancing in arms and the whole art of fighting--when grown-up women,
they should apply themselves to evolutions and tactics, and the mode of
grounding and taking up arms; if for no other reason, yet in case
the whole military force should have to leave the city and carry on
operations of war outside, that those who will have to guard the young
and the rest of the city may be equal to the task; and, on the other
hand, when enemies, whether barbarian or hellenic, come from without
with mighty force and make a violent assault upon them, and thus compel
them to fight for the possession of the city, which is far from being
an impossibility, great would be the disgrace to the state, if the women
had been so miserably trained that they could not fight for their young,
as birds will, against any creature however strong, and die or undergo
any danger, but must instantly rush to the temples and crowd at the
altars and shrines, and bring upon human nature the reproach, that of
all animals man is the most cowardly!

cleinias: such a want of education, stranger, is certainly an unseemly
thing to happen in a state, as well as a great misfortune.

athenian: suppose that we carry our law to the extent of saying that
women ought not to neglect military matters, but that all citizens, male
and female alike, shall attend to them?

cleinias: i quite agree.

athenian: of wrestling we have spoken in part, but of what i should
call the most important part we have not spoken, and cannot easily speak
without showing at the same time by gesture as well as in word what we
mean; when word and action combine, and not till then, we shall explain
clearly what has been said, pointing out that of all movements wrestling
is most akin to the military art, and is to be pursued for the sake of
this, and not this for the sake of wrestling.

cleinias: excellent. athenian: enough of wrestling; we will now proceed
to speak of other movements of the body. such motion may be in general
called dancing, and is of two kinds: one of nobler figures, imitating
the honourable, the other of the more ignoble figures, imitating the
mean; and of both these there are two further subdivisions. of the
serious, one kind is of those engaged in war and vehement action, and is
the exercise of a noble person and a manly heart; the other exhibits a
temperate soul in the enjoyment of prosperity and modest pleasures,
and may be truly called and is the dance of peace. the warrior dance is
different from the peaceful one, and may be rightly termed pyrrhic; this
imitates the modes of avoiding blows and missiles by dropping or giving
way, or springing aside, or rising up or falling down; also the opposite
postures which are those of action, as, for example, the imitation of
archery and the hurling of javelins, and of all sorts of blows. and when
the imitation is of brave bodies and souls, and the action is direct and
muscular, giving for the most part a straight movement to the limbs of
the body--that, i say, is the true sort; but the opposite is not right.
in the dance of peace what we have to consider is whether a man bears
himself naturally and gracefully, and after the manner of men who duly
conform to the law. but before proceeding i must distinguish the dancing
about which there is any doubt, from that about which there is no doubt.
which is the doubtful kind, and how are the two to be distinguished?
there are dances of the bacchic sort, both those in which, as they say,
they imitate drunken men, and which are named after the nymphs, and pan,
and silenuses, and satyrs; and also those in which purifications are
made or mysteries celebrated--all this sort of dancing cannot be rightly
defined as having either a peaceful or a warlike character, or indeed as
having any meaning whatever, and may, i think, be most truly described
as distinct from the warlike dance, and distinct from the peaceful, and
not suited for a city at all. there let it lie; and so leaving it to
lie, we will proceed to the dances of war and peace, for with these
we are undoubtedly concerned. now the unwarlike muse, which honours in
dance the gods and the sons of the gods, is entirely associated with
the consciousness of prosperity; this class may be subdivided into two
lesser classes, of which one is expressive of an escape from some labour
or danger into good, and has greater pleasures, the other expressive of
preservation and increase of former good, in which the pleasure is less
exciting--in all these cases, every man when the pleasure is greater,
moves his body more, and less when the pleasure is less; and, again,
if he be more orderly and has learned courage from discipline he moves
less, but if he be a coward, and has no training or self-control, he
makes greater and more violent movements, and in general when he is
speaking or singing he is not altogether able to keep his body still;
and so out of the imitation of words in gestures the whole art of
dancing has arisen. and in these various kinds of imitation one man
moves in an orderly, another in a disorderly manner; and as the ancients
may be observed to have given many names which are according to nature
and deserving of praise, so there is an excellent one which they have
given to the dances of men who in their times of prosperity are moderate
in their pleasures--the giver of names, whoever he was, assigned to
them a very true, and poetical, and rational name, when he called them
emmeleiai, or dances of order, thus establishing two kinds of dances of
the nobler sort, the dance of war which he called the pyrrhic, and the
dance of peace which he called emmeleia, or the dance of order; giving
to each their appropriate and becoming name. these things the legislator
should indicate in general outline, and the guardian of the law should
enquire into them and search them out, combining dancing with music, and
assigning to the several sacrificial feasts that which is suitable to
them; and when he has consecrated all of them in due order, he shall for
the future change nothing, whether of dance or song. thenceforward
the city and the citizens shall continue to have the same pleasures,
themselves being as far as possible alike, and shall live well and
happily.

i have described the dances which are appropriate to noble bodies and
generous souls. but it is necessary also to consider and know uncomely
persons and thoughts, and those which are intended to produce laughter
in comedy, and have a comic character in respect of style, song, and
dance, and of the imitations which these afford. for serious things
cannot be understood without laughable things, nor opposites at all
without opposites, if a man is really to have intelligence of either;
but he cannot carry out both in action, if he is to have any degree of
virtue. and for this very reason he should learn them both, in order
that he may not in ignorance do or say anything which is ridiculous and
out of place--he should command slaves and hired strangers to imitate
such things, but he should never take any serious interest in them
himself, nor should any freeman or freewoman be discovered taking pains
to learn them; and there should always be some element of novelty in
the imitation. let these then be laid down, both in law and in our
discourse, as the regulations of laughable amusements which are
generally called comedy. and, if any of the serious poets, as they are
termed, who write tragedy, come to us and say--'o strangers, may we go
to your city and country or may we not, and shall we bring with us our
poetry--what is your will about these matters?'--how shall we answer
the divine men? i think that our answer should be as follows: best of
strangers, we will say to them, we also according to our ability are
tragic poets, and our tragedy is the best and noblest; for our whole
state is an imitation of the best and noblest life, which we affirm to
be indeed the very truth of tragedy. you are poets and we are poets,
both makers of the same strains, rivals and antagonists in the noblest
of dramas, which true law can alone perfect, as our hope is. do not then
suppose that we shall all in a moment allow you to erect your stage in
the agora, or introduce the fair voices of your actors, speaking above
our own, and permit you to harangue our women and children, and the
common people, about our institutions, in language other than our own,
and very often the opposite of our own. for a state would be mad which
gave you this licence, until the magistrates had determined whether your
poetry might be recited, and was fit for publication or not. wherefore,
o ye sons and scions of the softer muses, first of all show your songs
to the magistrates, and let them compare them with our own, and if they
are the same or better we will give you a chorus; but if not, then,
my friends, we cannot. let these, then, be the customs ordained by law
about all dances and the teaching of them, and let matters relating
to slaves be separated from those relating to masters, if you do not
object.

cleinias: we can have no hesitation in assenting when you put the matter
thus.

athenian: there still remain three studies suitable for freemen.
arithmetic is one of them; the measurement of length, surface, and depth
is the second; and the third has to do with the revolutions of the stars
in relation to one another. not every one has need to toil through all
these things in a strictly scientific manner, but only a few, and who
they are to be we will hereafter indicate at the end, which will be the
proper place; not to know what is necessary for mankind in general, and
what is the truth, is disgraceful to every one: and yet to enter into
these matters minutely is neither easy, nor at all possible for every
one; but there is something in them which is necessary and cannot be
set aside, and probably he who made the proverb about god originally had
this in view when he said, that 'not even god himself can fight against
necessity;' he meant, if i am not mistaken, divine necessity; for as to
the human necessities of which the many speak, when they talk in this
manner, nothing can be more ridiculous than such an application of the
words.

cleinias: and what necessities of knowledge are there, stranger, which
are divine and not human?

athenian: i conceive them to be those of which he who has no use nor any
knowledge at all cannot be a god, or demi-god, or hero to mankind, or
able to take any serious thought or charge of them. and very unlike a
divine man would he be, who is unable to count one, two, three, or
to distinguish odd and even numbers, or is unable to count at all,
or reckon night and day, and who is totally unacquainted with the
revolution of the sun and moon, and the other stars. there would be
great folly in supposing that all these are not necessary parts of
knowledge to him who intends to know anything about the highest kinds of
knowledge; but which these are, and how many there are of them, and
when they are to be learned, and what is to be learned together and what
apart, and the whole correlation of them, must be rightly apprehended
first; and these leading the way we may proceed to the other parts of
knowledge. for so necessity grounded in nature constrains us, against
which we say that no god contends, or ever will contend.

cleinias: i think, stranger, that what you have now said is very true
and agreeable to nature.

athenian: yes, cleinias, that is so. but it is difficult for the
legislator to begin with these studies; at a more convenient time we
will make regulations for them.

cleinias: you seem, stranger, to be afraid of our habitual ignorance
of the subject: there is no reason why that should prevent you from
speaking out.

athenian: i certainly am afraid of the difficulties to which you allude,
but i am still more afraid of those who apply themselves to this sort
of knowledge, and apply themselves badly. for entire ignorance is not so
terrible or extreme an evil, and is far from being the greatest of
all; too much cleverness and too much learning, accompanied with an ill
bringing up, are far more fatal.

cleinias: true.

athenian: all freemen i conceive, should learn as much of these branches
of knowledge as every child in egypt is taught when he learns the
alphabet. in that country arithmetical games have been invented for the
use of mere children, which they learn as a pleasure and amusement. they
have to distribute apples and garlands, using the same number sometimes
for a larger and sometimes for a lesser number of persons; and they
arrange pugilists and wrestlers as they pair together by lot or remain
over, and show how their turns come in natural order. another mode of
amusing them is to distribute vessels, sometimes of gold, brass, silver,
and the like, intermixed with one another, sometimes of one metal only;
as i was saying they adapt to their amusement the numbers in common use,
and in this way make more intelligible to their pupils the arrangements
and movements of armies and expeditions, and in the management of a
household they make people more useful to themselves, and more wide
awake; and again in measurements of things which have length, and
breadth, and depth, they free us from that natural ignorance of all
these things which is so ludicrous and disgraceful.

cleinias: what kind of ignorance do you mean?

athenian: o my dear cleinias, i, like yourself, have late in life heard
with amazement of our ignorance in these matters; to me we appear to be
more like pigs than men, and i am quite ashamed, not only of myself, but
of all hellenes.

cleinias: about what? say, stranger, what you mean.

athenian: i will; or rather i will show you my meaning by a question,
and do you please to answer me: you know, i suppose, what length is?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and what breadth is?

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: and you know that these are two distinct things, and that
there is a third thing called depth?

cleinias: of course.

athenian: and do not all these seem to you to be commensurable with
themselves?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: that is to say, length is naturally commensurable with length,
and breadth with breadth, and depth in like manner with depth?

cleinias: undoubtedly.

athenian: but if some things are commensurable and others wholly
incommensurable, and you think that all things are commensurable, what
is your position in regard to them?

cleinias: clearly, far from good.

athenian: concerning length and breadth when compared with depth, or
breadth and length when compared with one another, are not all the
hellenes agreed that these are commensurable with one another in some
way?

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: but if they are absolutely incommensurable, and yet all of us
regard them as commensurable, have we not reason to be ashamed of our
compatriots; and might we not say to them: o ye best of hellenes, is not
this one of the things of which we were saying that not to know them
is disgraceful, and of which to have a bare knowledge only is no great
distinction?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and there are other things akin to these, in which there
spring up other errors of the same family.

cleinias: what are they?

athenian: the natures of commensurable and incommensurable quantities in
their relation to one another. a man who is good for anything ought
to be able, when he thinks, to distinguish them; and different persons
should compete with one another in asking questions, which will be a far
better and more graceful way of passing their time than the old man's
game of draughts.

cleinias: i dare say; and these pastimes are not so very unlike a game
of draughts.

athenian: and these, as i maintain, cleinias, are the studies which
our youth ought to learn, for they are innocent and not difficult; the
learning of them will be an amusement, and they will benefit the state.
if any one is of another mind, let him say what he has to say.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: then if these studies are such as we maintain, we will include
them; if not, they shall be excluded.

cleinias: assuredly: but may we not now, stranger, prescribe these
studies as necessary, and so fill up the lacunae of our laws?

athenian: they shall be regarded as pledges which may be hereafter
redeemed and removed from our state, if they do not please either us who
give them, or you who accept them.

cleinias: a fair condition.

athenian: next let us see whether we are or are not willing that the
study of astronomy shall be proposed for our youth.

cleinias: proceed.

athenian: here occurs a strange phenomenon, which certainly cannot in
any point of view be tolerated.

cleinias: to what are you referring?

athenian: men say that we ought not to enquire into the supreme god
and the nature of the universe, nor busy ourselves in searching out the
causes of things, and that such enquiries are impious; whereas the very
opposite is the truth.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: perhaps what i am saying may seem paradoxical, and at variance
with the usual language of age. but when any one has any good and
true notion which is for the advantage of the state and in every way
acceptable to god, he cannot abstain from expressing it.

cleinias: your words are reasonable enough; but shall we find any good
or true notion about the stars?

athenian: my good friends, at this hour all of us hellenes tell lies,
if i may use such an expression, about those great gods, the sun and the
moon.

cleinias: lies of what nature?

athenian: we say that they and divers other stars do not keep the same
path, and we call them planets or wanderers.

cleinias: very true, stranger; and in the course of my life i have often
myself seen the morning star and the evening star and divers others not
moving in their accustomed course, but wandering out of their path in
all manner of ways, and i have seen the sun and moon doing what we all
know that they do.

athenian: just so, megillus and cleinias; and i maintain that our
citizens and our youth ought to learn about the nature of the gods in
heaven, so far as to be able to offer sacrifices and pray to them in
pious language, and not to blaspheme about them.

cleinias: there you are right, if such a knowledge be only attainable;
and if we are wrong in our mode of speaking now, and can be better
instructed and learn to use better language, then i quite agree with
you that such a degree of knowledge as will enable us to speak rightly
should be acquired by us. and now do you try to explain to us your whole
meaning, and we, on our part, will endeavour to understand you.

athenian: there is some difficulty in understanding my meaning, but not
a very great one, nor will any great length of time be required. and of
this i am myself a proof; for i did not know these things long ago, nor
in the days of my youth, and yet i can explain them to you in a brief
space of time; whereas if they had been difficult i could certainly
never have explained them all, old as i am, to old men like yourselves.

cleinias: true; but what is this study which you describe as wonderful
and fitting for youth to learn, but of which we are ignorant? try and
explain the nature of it to us as clearly as you can.

athenian: i will. for, o my good friends, that other doctrine about the
wandering of the sun and the moon and the other stars is not the truth,
but the very reverse of the truth. each of them moves in the same
path--not in many paths, but in one only, which is circular, and the
varieties are only apparent. nor are we right in supposing that the
swiftest of them is the slowest, nor conversely, that the slowest is
the quickest. and if what i say is true, only just imagine that we had a
similar notion about horses running at olympia, or about men who ran in
the long course, and that we addressed the swiftest as the slowest and
the slowest as the swiftest, and sang the praises of the vanquished as
though he were the victor--in that case our praises would not be true,
nor very agreeable to the runners, though they be but men; and now, to
commit the same error about the gods which would have been ludicrous and
erroneous in the case of men--is not that ludicrous and erroneous?

cleinias: worse than ludicrous, i should say.

athenian: at all events, the gods cannot like us to be spreading a false
report of them.

cleinias: most true, if such is the fact.

athenian: and if we can show that such is really the fact, then all
these matters ought to be learned so far as is necessary for the
avoidance of impiety; but if we cannot, they may be let alone, and let
this be our decision.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: enough of laws relating to education and learning. but
hunting and similar pursuits in like manner claim our attention. for
the legislator appears to have a duty imposed upon him which goes beyond
mere legislation. there is something over and above law which lies in a
region between admonition and law, and has several times occurred to us
in the course of discussion; for example, in the education of very young
children there were things, as we maintain, which are not to be defined,
and to regard them as matters of positive law is a great absurdity.
now, our laws and the whole constitution of our state having been thus
delineated, the praise of the virtuous citizen is not complete when he
is described as the person who serves the laws best and obeys them most,
but the higher form of praise is that which describes him as the good
citizen who passes through life undefiled and is obedient to the words
of the legislator, both when he is giving laws and when he assigns
praise and blame. this is the truest word that can be spoken in praise
of a citizen; and the true legislator ought not only to write his
laws, but also to interweave with them all such things as seem to him
honourable and dishonourable. and the perfect citizen ought to seek to
strengthen these no less than the principles of law which are sanctioned
by punishments. i will adduce an example which will clear up my meaning,
and will be a sort of witness to my words. hunting is of wide extent,
and has a name under which many things are included, for there is a
hunting of creatures in the water, and of creatures in the air, and
there is a great deal of hunting of land animals of all kinds, and
not of wild beasts only. the hunting after man is also worthy of
consideration; there is the hunting after him in war, and there is often
a hunting after him in the way of friendship, which is praised and also
blamed; and there is thieving, and the hunting which is practised by
robbers, and that of armies against armies. now the legislator, in
laying down laws about hunting, can neither abstain from noting these
things, nor can he make threatening ordinances which will assign rules
and penalties about all of them. what is he to do? he will have to
praise and blame hunting with a view to the exercise and pursuits of
youth. and, on the other hand, the young man must listen obediently;
neither pleasure nor pain should hinder him, and he should regard as his
standard of action the praises and injunctions of the legislator rather
than the punishments which he imposes by law. this being premised, there
will follow next in order moderate praise and censure of hunting; the
praise being assigned to that kind which will make the souls of young
men better, and the censure to that which has the opposite effect. and
now let us address young men in the form of a prayer for their welfare:
o friends, we will say to them, may no desire or love of hunting in the
sea, or of angling or of catching the creatures in the waters, ever take
possession of you, either when you are awake or when you are asleep, by
hook or with weels, which latter is a very lazy contrivance; and let not
any desire of catching men and of piracy by sea enter into your souls
and make you cruel and lawless hunters. and as to the desire of thieving
in town or country, may it never enter into your most passing thoughts;
nor let the insidious fancy of catching birds, which is hardly worthy
of freemen, come into the head of any youth. there remains therefore for
our athletes only the hunting and catching of land animals, of which the
one sort is called hunting by night, in which the hunters sleep in turn
and are lazy; this is not to be commended any more than that which has
intervals of rest, in which the wild strength of beasts is subdued by
nets and snares, and not by the victory of a laborious spirit. thus,
only the best kind of hunting is allowed at all--that of quadrupeds,
which is carried on with horses and dogs and men's own persons, and they
get the victory over the animals by running them down and striking them
and hurling at them, those who have a care of godlike manhood taking
them with their own hands. the praise and blame which is assigned to all
these things has now been declared; and let the law be as follows: let
no one hinder these who verily are sacred hunters from following the
chase wherever and whithersoever they will; but the hunter by night, who
trusts to his nets and gins, shall not be allowed to hunt anywhere.
the fowler in the mountains and waste places shall be permitted, but on
cultivated ground and on consecrated wilds he shall not be permitted;
and any one who meets him may stop him. as to the hunter in waters, he
may hunt anywhere except in harbours or sacred streams or marshes or
pools, provided only that he do not pollute the water with poisonous
juices. and now we may say that all our enactments about education are
complete.

cleinias: very good.




book viii.

athenian: next, with the help of the delphian oracle, we have to
institute festivals and make laws about them, and to determine what
sacrifices will be for the good of the city, and to what gods they shall
be offered; but when they shall be offered, and how often, may be partly
regulated by us.

cleinias: the number--yes.

athenian: then we will first determine the number; and let the whole
number be 365--one for every day--so that one magistrate at least will
sacrifice daily to some god or demi-god on behalf of the city, and the
citizens, and their possessions. and the interpreters, and priests, and
priestesses, and prophets shall meet, and, in company with the guardians
of the law, ordain those things which the legislator of necessity omits;
and i may remark that they are the very persons who ought to take
note of what is omitted. the law will say that there are twelve feasts
dedicated to the twelve gods, after whom the several tribes are named;
and that to each of them they shall sacrifice every month, and appoint
choruses, and musical and gymnastic contests, assigning them so as to
suit the gods and seasons of the year. and they shall have festivals for
women, distinguishing those which ought to be separated from the men's
festivals, and those which ought not. further, they shall not confuse
the infernal deities and their rites with the gods who are termed
heavenly and their rites, but shall separate them, giving to pluto his
own in the twelfth month, which is sacred to him, according to the
law. to such a deity warlike men should entertain no aversion, but
they should honour him as being always the best friend of man. for the
connexion of soul and body is no way better than the dissolution of
them, as i am ready to maintain quite seriously. moreover, those who
would regulate these matters rightly should consider, that our city
among existing cities has no fellow, either in respect of leisure or
command of the necessaries of life, and that like an individual she
ought to live happily. and those who would live happily should in the
first place do no wrong to one another, and ought not themselves to be
wronged by others; to attain the first is not difficult, but there is
great difficulty in acquiring the power of not being wronged. no man can
be perfectly secure against wrong, unless he has become perfectly good;
and cities are like individuals in this, for a city if good has a life
of peace, but if evil, a life of war within and without. wherefore the
citizens ought to practise war--not in time of war, but rather while
they are at peace. and every city which has any sense, should take
the field at least for one day in every month, and for more if the
magistrates think fit, having no regard to winter cold or summer
heat; and they should go out en masse, including their wives and their
children, when the magistrates determine to lead forth the whole people,
or in separate portions when summoned by them; and they should always
provide that there should be games and sacrificial feasts, and they
should have tournaments, imitating in as lively a manner as they can
real battles. and they should distribute prizes of victory and valour to
the competitors, passing censures and encomiums on one another according
to the characters which they bear in the contests and in their whole
life, honouring him who seems to be the best, and blaming him who is the
opposite. and let poets celebrate the victors--not however every poet,
but only one who in the first place is not less than fifty years of
age; nor should he be one who, although he may have musical and poetical
gifts, has never in his life done any noble or illustrious action; but
those who are themselves good and also honourable in the state, creators
of noble actions--let their poems be sung, even though they be not very
musical. and let the judgment of them rest with the instructor of youth
and the other guardians of the laws, who shall give them this privilege,
and they alone shall be free to sing; but the rest of the world shall
not have this liberty. nor shall any one dare to sing a song which has
not been approved by the judgment of the guardians of the laws, not even
if his strain be sweeter than the songs of thamyras and orpheus; but
only such poems as have been judged sacred and dedicated to the gods,
and such as are the works of good men, in which praise or blame has been
awarded and which have been deemed to fulfil their design fairly.

the regulations about war, and about liberty of speech in poetry, ought
to apply equally to men and women. the legislator may be supposed to
argue the question in his own mind: who are my citizens for whom i have
set in order the city? are they not competitors in the greatest of all
contests, and have they not innumerable rivals? to be sure, will be the
natural reply. well, but if we were training boxers, or pancratiasts,
or any other sort of athletes, would they never meet until the hour
of contest arrived; and should we do nothing to prepare ourselves
previously by daily practice? surely, if we were boxers, we should have
been learning to fight for many days before, and exercising ourselves
in imitating all those blows and wards which we were intending to use in
the hour of conflict; and in order that we might come as near to reality
as possible, instead of cestuses we should put on boxing-gloves, that
the blows and the wards might be practised by us to the utmost of our
power. and if there were a lack of competitors, the ridicule of fools
would not deter us from hanging up a lifeless image and practising at
that. or if we had no adversary at all, animate or inanimate, should we
not venture in the dearth of antagonists to spar by ourselves? in what
other manner could we ever study the art of self-defence?

cleinias: the way which you mention, stranger, would be the only way.

athenian: and shall the warriors of our city, who are destined when
occasion calls to enter the greatest of all contests, and to fight for
their lives, and their children, and their property, and the whole city,
be worse prepared than boxers? and will the legislator, because he
is afraid that their practising with one another may appear to some
ridiculous, abstain from commanding them to go out and fight; will he
not ordain that soldiers shall perform lesser exercises without arms
every day, making dancing and all gymnastic tend to this end; and also
will he not require that they shall practise some gymnastic exercises,
greater as well as lesser, as often as every month; and that they shall
have contests one with another in every part of the country, seizing
upon posts and lying in ambush, and imitating in every respect the
reality of war; fighting with boxing-gloves and hurling javelins, and
using weapons somewhat dangerous, and as nearly as possible like the
true ones, in order that the sport may not be altogether without fear,
but may have terrors and to a certain degree show the man who has
and who has not courage; and that the honour and dishonour which are
assigned to them respectively, may prepare the whole city for the true
conflict of life? if any one dies in these mimic contests, the homicide
is involuntary, and we will make the slayer, when he has been purified
according to law, to be pure of blood, considering that if a few men
should die, others as good as they will be born; but that if fear is
dead, then the citizens will never find a test of superior and inferior
natures, which is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of a
few.

cleinias: we are quite agreed, stranger, that we should legislate about
such things, and that the whole state should practise them.

athenian: and what is the reason that dances and contests of this sort
hardly ever exist in states, at least not to any extent worth speaking
of? is this due to the ignorance of mankind and their legislators?

cleinias: perhaps.

athenian: certainly not, sweet cleinias; there are two causes, which are
quite enough to account for the deficiency.

cleinias: what are they?

athenian: one cause is the love of wealth, which wholly absorbs men,
and never for a moment allows them to think of anything but their own
private possessions; on this the soul of every citizen hangs suspended,
and can attend to nothing but his daily gain; mankind are ready to learn
any branch of knowledge, and to follow any pursuit which tends to this
end, and they laugh at every other: that is one reason why a city will
not be in earnest about such contests or any other good and honourable
pursuit. but from an insatiable love of gold and silver, every man will
stoop to any art or contrivance, seemly or unseemly, in the hope of
becoming rich; and will make no objection to performing any action,
holy, or unholy and utterly base; if only like a beast he have the power
of eating and drinking all kinds of things, and procuring for himself in
every sort of way the gratification of his lusts.

cleinias: true.

athenian: let this, then, be deemed one of the causes which prevent
states from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war, or any other
noble aim, but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankind into
merchants, and captains of ships, and servants, and converts the valiant
sort into thieves and burglars, and robbers of temples, and violent,
tyrannical persons; many of whom are not without ability, but they are
unfortunate.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled
to pass through life always hungering?

cleinias: then that is one cause, stranger; but you spoke of another.

athenian: thank you for reminding me.

cleinias: the insatiable lifelong love of wealth, as you were saying,
is one cause which absorbs mankind, and prevents them from rightly
practising the arts of war: granted; and now tell me, what is the other?

athenian: do you imagine that i delay because i am in a perplexity?

cleinias: no; but we think that you are too severe upon the money-loving
temper, of which you seem in the present discussion to have a peculiar
dislike.

athenian: that is a very fair rebuke, cleinias; and i will now proceed
to the second cause.

cleinias: proceed.

athenian: i say that governments are a cause--democracy, oligarchy,
tyranny, concerning which i have often spoken in the previous discourse;
or rather governments they are not, for none of them exercises a
voluntary rule over voluntary subjects; but they may be truly called
states of discord, in which while the government is voluntary, the
subjects always obey against their will, and have to be coerced; and
the ruler fears the subject, and will not, if he can help, allow him to
become either noble, or rich, or strong, or valiant, or warlike at all.
these two are the chief causes of almost all evils, and of the evils of
which i have been speaking they are notably the causes. but our state
has escaped both of them; for her citizens have the greatest leisure,
and they are not subject to one another, and will, i think, be made by
these laws the reverse of lovers of money. such a constitution may be
reasonably supposed to be the only one existing which will accept the
education which we have described, and the martial pastimes which have
been perfected according to our idea.

cleinias: true.

athenian: then next we must remember, about all gymnastic contests, that
only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to have prizes
of victory; and those which are not military are to be given up. the
military sort had better be completely described and established by law;
and first, let us speak of running and swiftness.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: certainly the most military of all qualities is general
activity of body, whether of foot or hand. for escaping or for capturing
an enemy, quickness of foot is required; but hand-to-hand conflict and
combat need vigour and strength.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: neither of them can attain their greatest efficiency without
arms.

cleinias: how can they?

athenian: then our herald, in accordance with the prevailing practice,
will first summon the runner--he will appear armed, for to an unarmed
competitor we will not give a prize. and he shall enter first who is to
run the single course bearing arms; next, he who is to run the double
course; third, he who is to run the horse-course; and fourthly, he who
is to run the long course; the fifth whom we start, shall be the first
sent forth in heavy armour, and shall run a course of sixty stadia to
some temple of ares--and we will send forth another, whom we will style
the more heavily armed, to run over smoother ground. there remains the
archer; and he shall run in the full equipments of an archer a distance
of 100 stadia over mountains, and across every sort of country, to a
temple of apollo and artemis; this shall be the order of the contest,
and we will wait for them until they return, and will give a prize to
the conqueror in each.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: let us suppose that there are three kinds of contests--one of
boys, another of beardless youths, and a third of men. for the youths
we will fix the length of the contest at two-thirds, and for the boys
at half of the entire course, whether they contend as archers or as
heavy-armed. touching the women, let the girls who are not grown up
compete naked in the stadium and the double course, and the horse-course
and the long course, and let them run on the race-ground itself; those
who are thirteen years of age and upwards until their marriage shall
continue to share in contests if they are not more than twenty, and
shall be compelled to run up to eighteen; and they shall descend into
the arena in suitable dresses. let these be the regulations about
contests in running both for men and women.

respecting contests of strength, instead of wrestling and similar
contests of the heavier sort, we will institute conflicts in armour of
one against one, and two against two, and so on up to ten against ten.
as to what a man ought not to suffer or do, and to what extent, in order
to gain the victory--as in wrestling, the masters of the art have laid
down what is fair and what is not fair, so in fighting in armour--we
ought to call in skilful persons, who shall judge for us and be our
assessors in the work of legislation; they shall say who deserves to be
victor in combats of this sort, and what he is not to do or have done
to him, and in like manner what rule determines who is defeated; and
let these ordinances apply to women until they are married as well as
to men. the pancration shall have a counterpart in a combat of the
light-armed; they shall contend with bows and with light shields and
with javelins and in the throwing of stones by slings and by hand: and
laws shall be made about it, and rewards and prizes given to him who
best fulfils the ordinances of the law.

next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse contests. now
we do not need many horses, for they cannot be of much use in a country
like crete, and hence we naturally do not take great pains about the
rearing of them or about horse races. there is no one who keeps a
chariot among us, and any rivalry in such matters would be altogether
out of place; there would be no sense nor any shadow of sense in
instituting contests which are not after the manner of our country. and
therefore we give our prizes for single horses--for colts who have not
yet cast their teeth, and for those who are intermediate, and for the
full-grown horses themselves; and thus our equestrian games will accord
with the nature of the country. let them have conflict and rivalry
in these matters in accordance with the law, and let the colonels and
generals of horse decide together about all courses and about the armed
competitors in them. but we have nothing to say to the unarmed either in
gymnastic exercises or in these contests. on the other hand, the cretan
bowman or javelin-man who fights in armour on horseback is useful, and
therefore we may as well place a competition of this sort among
our amusements. women are not to be forced to compete by laws and
ordinances; but if from previous training they have acquired the habit
and are strong enough and like to take part, let them do so, girls as
well as boys, and no blame to them.

thus the competition in gymnastic and the mode of learning it have been
described; and we have spoken also of the toils of the contest, and of
daily exercises under the superintendence of masters. likewise, what
relates to music has been, for the most part, completed. but as to
rhapsodes and the like, and the contests of choruses which are to
perform at feasts, all this shall be arranged when the months and days
and years have been appointed for gods and demi-gods, whether every
third year, or again every fifth year, or in whatever way or manner the
gods may put into men's minds the distribution and order of them. at the
same time, we may expect that the musical contests will be celebrated
in their turn by the command of the judges and the director of education
and the guardians of the law meeting together for this purpose, and
themselves becoming legislators of the times and nature and conditions
of the choral contests and of dancing in general. what they ought
severally to be in language and song, and in the admixture of harmony
with rhythm and the dance, has been often declared by the original
legislator; and his successors ought to follow him, making the games and
sacrifices duly to correspond at fitting times, and appointing public
festivals. it is not difficult to determine how these and the like
matters may have a regular order; nor, again, will the alteration of
them do any great good or harm to the state. there is, however, another
matter of great importance and difficulty, concerning which god should
legislate, if there were any possibility of obtaining from him an
ordinance about it. but seeing that divine aid is not to be had, there
appears to be a need of some bold man who specially honours plainness
of speech, and will say outright what he thinks best for the city and
citizens--ordaining what is good and convenient for the whole state amid
the corruptions of human souls, opposing the mightiest lusts, and having
no man his helper but himself standing alone and following reason only.

cleinias: what is this, stranger, that you are saying? for we do not as
yet understand your meaning.

athenian: very likely; i will endeavour to explain myself more clearly.
when i came to the subject of education, i beheld young men and maidens
holding friendly intercourse with one another. and there naturally arose
in my mind a sort of apprehension--i could not help thinking how one is
to deal with a city in which youths and maidens are well nurtured, and
have nothing to do, and are not undergoing the excessive and servile
toils which extinguish wantonness, and whose only cares during their
whole life are sacrifices and festivals and dances. how, in such a state
as this, will they abstain from desires which thrust many a man and
woman into perdition; and from which reason, assuming the functions of
law, commands them to abstain? the ordinances already made may possibly
get the better of most of these desires; the prohibition of excessive
wealth is a very considerable gain in the direction of temperance, and
the whole education of our youth imposes a law of moderation on them;
moreover, the eye of the rulers is required always to watch over the
young, and never to lose sight of them; and these provisions do, as far
as human means can effect anything, exercise a regulating influence
upon the desires in general. but how can we take precautions against the
unnatural loves of either sex, from which innumerable evils have come
upon individuals and cities? how shall we devise a remedy and way of
escape out of so great a danger? truly, cleinias, here is a difficulty.
in many ways crete and lacedaemon furnish a great help to those who
make peculiar laws; but in the matter of love, as we are alone, i must
confess that they are quite against us. for if any one following nature
should lay down the law which existed before the days of laius, and
denounce these lusts as contrary to nature, adducing the animals as a
proof that such unions were monstrous, he might prove his point, but
he would be wholly at variance with the custom of your states. further,
they are repugnant to a principle which we say that a legislator should
always observe; for we are always enquiring which of our enactments
tends to virtue and which not. and suppose we grant that these loves are
accounted by law to the honourable, or at least not disgraceful, in what
degree will they contribute to virtue? will such passions implant in the
soul of him who is seduced the habit of courage, or in the soul of the
seducer the principle of temperance? who will ever believe this? or
rather, who will not blame the effeminacy of him who yields to pleasures
and is unable to hold out against them? will not all men censure
as womanly him who imitates the woman? and who would ever think of
establishing such a practice by law? certainly no one who had in his
mind the image of true law. how can we prove that what i am saying is
true? he who would rightly consider these matters must see the nature of
friendship and desire, and of these so-called loves, for they are of two
kinds, and out of the two arises a third kind, having the same name; and
this similarity of name causes all the difficulty and obscurity.

cleinias: how is that?

athenian: dear is the like in virtue to the like, and the equal to the
equal; dear also, though unlike, is he who has abundance to him who is
in want. and when either of these friendships becomes excessive, we term
the excess love.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: the friendship which arises from contraries is horrible and
coarse, and has often no tie of communion; but that which arises from
likeness is gentle, and has a tie of communion which lasts through life.
as to the mixed sort which is made up of them both, there is, first of
all, a difficulty in determining what he who is possessed by this third
love desires; moreover, he is drawn different ways, and is in doubt
between the two principles; the one exhorting him to enjoy the beauty of
youth, and the other forbidding him. for the one is a lover of the
body, and hungers after beauty, like ripe fruit, and would fain satisfy
himself without any regard to the character of the beloved; the other
holds the desire of the body to be a secondary matter, and looking
rather than loving and with his soul desiring the soul of the other in
a becoming manner, regards the satisfaction of the bodily love as
wantonness; he reverences and respects temperance and courage and
magnanimity and wisdom, and wishes to live chastely with the chaste
object of his affection. now the sort of love which is made up of the
other two is that which we have described as the third. seeing then
that there are these three sorts of love, ought the law to prohibit and
forbid them all to exist among us? is it not rather clear that we should
wish to have in the state the love which is of virtue and which desires
the beloved youth to be the best possible; and the other two, if
possible, we should hinder? what do you say, friend megillus?

megillus: i think, stranger, that you are perfectly right in what you
have been now saying.

athenian: i knew well, my friend, that i should obtain your assent,
which i accept, and therefore have no need to analyze your custom any
further. cleinias shall be prevailed upon to give me his assent at some
other time. enough of this; and now let us proceed to the laws.

megillus: very good.

athenian: upon reflection i see a way of imposing the law, which, in one
respect, is easy, but, in another, is of the utmost difficulty.

megillus: what do you mean?

athenian: we are all aware that most men, in spite of their lawless
natures, are very strictly and precisely restrained from intercourse
with the fair, and this is not at all against their will, but entirely
with their will.

megillus: when do you mean?

athenian: when any one has a brother or sister who is fair; and about
a son or daughter the same unwritten law holds, and is a most perfect
safeguard, so that no open or secret connexion ever takes place between
them. nor does the thought of such a thing ever enter at all into the
minds of most of them.

megillus: very true.

athenian: does not a little word extinguish all pleasures of that sort?

megillus: what word?

athenian: the declaration that they are unholy, hated of god, and most
infamous; and is not the reason of this that no one has ever said
the opposite, but every one from his earliest childhood has heard men
speaking in the same manner about them always and everywhere, whether in
comedy or in the graver language of tragedy? when the poet introduces
on the stage a thyestes or an oedipus, or a macareus having secret
intercourse with his sister, he represents him, when found out, ready to
kill himself as the penalty of his sin.

megillus: you are very right in saying that tradition, if no breath of
opposition ever assails it, has a marvellous power.

athenian: am i not also right in saying that the legislator who wants
to master any of the passions which master man may easily know how to
subdue them? he will consecrate the tradition of their evil character
among all, slaves and freemen, women and children, throughout the city:
that will be the surest foundation of the law which he can make.

megillus: yes; but will he ever succeed in making all mankind use the
same language about them?

athenian: a good objection; but was i not just now saying that i had
a way to make men use natural love and abstain from unnatural, not
intentionally destroying the seeds of human increase, or sowing them in
stony places, in which they will take no root; and that i would command
them to abstain too from any female field of increase in which that
which is sown is not likely to grow? now if a law to this effect could
only be made perpetual, and gain an authority such as already prevents
intercourse of parents and children--such a law, extending to other
sensual desires, and conquering them, would be the source of ten
thousand blessings. for, in the first place, moderation is the
appointment of nature, and deters men from all frenzy and madness of
love, and from all adulteries and immoderate use of meats and drinks,
and makes them good friends to their own wives. and innumerable other
benefits would result if such a law could only be enforced. i can
imagine some lusty youth who is standing by, and who, on hearing this
enactment, declares in scurrilous terms that we are making foolish and
impossible laws, and fills the world with his outcry. and therefore i
said that i knew a way of enacting and perpetuating such a law, which
was very easy in one respect, but in another most difficult. there is no
difficulty in seeing that such a law is possible, and in what way; for,
as i was saying, the ordinance once consecrated would master the soul of
every man, and terrify him into obedience. but matters have now come to
such a pass that even then the desired result seems as if it could not
be attained, just as the continuance of an entire state in the practice
of common meals is also deemed impossible. and although this latter is
partly disproven by the fact of their existence among you, still even in
your cities the common meals of women would be regarded as unnatural and
impossible. i was thinking of the rebelliousness of the human heart
when i said that the permanent establishment of these things is very
difficult.

megillus: very true.

athenian: shall i try and find some sort of persuasive argument which
will prove to you that such enactments are possible, and not beyond
human nature?

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: is a man more likely to abstain from the pleasures of love
and to do what he is bidden about them, when his body is in a good
condition, or when he is in an ill condition, and out of training?

cleinias: he will be far more temperate when he is in training.

athenian: and have we not heard of iccus of tarentum, who, with a view
to the olympic and other contests, in his zeal for his art, and also
because he was of a manly and temperate disposition, never had any
connexion with a woman or a youth during the whole time of his training?
and the same is said of crison and astylus and diopompus and many
others; and yet, cleinias, they were far worse educated in their minds
than your and my citizens, and in their bodies far more lusty.

cleinias: no doubt this fact has been often affirmed positively by the
ancients of these athletes.

athenian: and had they the courage to abstain from what is ordinarily
deemed a pleasure for the sake of a victory in wrestling, running, and
the like; and shall our young men be incapable of a similar endurance
for the sake of a much nobler victory, which is the noblest of all, as
from their youth upwards we will tell them, charming them, as we hope,
into the belief of this by tales and sayings and songs?

cleinias: of what victory are you speaking?

athenian: of the victory over pleasure, which if they win, they will
live happily; or if they are conquered, the reverse of happily. and,
further, may we not suppose that the fear of impiety will enable them to
master that which other inferior people have mastered?

cleinias: i dare say.

athenian: and since we have reached this point in our legislation,
and have fallen into a difficulty by reason of the vices of mankind, i
affirm that our ordinance should simply run in the following terms:
our citizens ought not to fall below the nature of birds and beasts in
general, who are born in great multitudes, and yet remain until the age
for procreation virgin and unmarried, but when they have reached the
proper time of life are coupled, male and female, and lovingly pair
together, and live the rest of their lives in holiness and innocence,
abiding firmly in their original compact: surely, we will say to them,
you should be better than the animals. but if they are corrupted by the
other hellenes and the common practice of barbarians, and they see
with their eyes and hear with their ears of the so-called free love
everywhere prevailing among them, and they themselves are not able to
get the better of the temptation, the guardians of the law, exercising
the functions of lawgivers, shall devise a second law against them.

cleinias: and what law would you advise them to pass if this one failed?

athenian: clearly, cleinias, the one which would naturally follow.

cleinias: what is that?

athenian: our citizens should not allow pleasures to strengthen with
indulgence, but should by toil divert the aliment and exuberance of them
into other parts of the body; and this will happen if no immodesty be
allowed in the practice of love. then they will be ashamed of frequent
intercourse, and they will find pleasure, if seldom enjoyed, to be a
less imperious mistress. they should not be found out doing anything of
the sort. concealment shall be honourable, and sanctioned by custom and
made law by unwritten prescription; on the other hand, to be detected
shall be esteemed dishonourable, but not, to abstain wholly. in this way
there will be a second legal standard of honourable and dishonourable,
involving a second notion of right. three principles will comprehend all
those corrupt natures whom we call inferior to themselves, and who form
but one class, and will compel them not to transgress.

cleinias: what are they?

athenian: the principle of piety, the love of honour, and the desire of
beauty, not in the body but in the soul. these are, perhaps, romantic
aspirations; but they are the noblest of aspirations, if they could only
be realised in all states, and, god willing, in the matter of love
we may be able to enforce one of two things--either that no one shall
venture to touch any person of the freeborn or noble class except his
wedded wife, or sow the unconsecrated and bastard seed among harlots, or
in barren and unnatural lusts; or at least we may abolish altogether the
connection of men with men; and as to women, if any man has to do with
any but those who come into his house duly married by sacred rites,
whether they be bought or acquired in any other way, and he offends
publicly in the face of all mankind, we shall be right in enacting that
he be deprived of civic honours and privileges, and be deemed to be, as
he truly is, a stranger. let this law, then, whether it is one, or ought
rather to be called two, be laid down respecting love in general, and
the intercourse of the sexes which arises out of the desires, whether
rightly or wrongly indulged.

megillus: i, for my part, stranger, would gladly receive this law.
cleinias shall speak for himself, and tell you what is his opinion.

cleinias: i will, megillus, when an opportunity offers; at present, i
think that we had better allow the stranger to proceed with his laws.

megillus: very good.

athenian: we had got about as far as the establishment of the common
tables, which in most places would be difficult, but in crete no
one would think of introducing any other custom. there might arise a
question about the manner of them--whether they shall be such as they
are here in crete, or such as they are in lacedaemon--or is there a
third kind which may be better than either of them? the answer to this
question might be easily discovered, but the discovery would do no great
good, for at present they are very well ordered.

leaving the common tables, we may therefore proceed to the means of
providing food. now, in cities the means of life are gained in many ways
and from divers sources, and in general from two sources, whereas our
city has only one. for most of the hellenes obtain their food from sea
and land, but our citizens from land only. and this makes the task of
the legislator less difficult--half as many laws will be enough, and
much less than half; and they will be of a kind better suited to free
men. for he has nothing to do with laws about shipowners and merchants
and retailers and inn-keepers and tax collectors and mines and
moneylending and compound interest and innumerable other things--bidding
good-bye to these, he gives laws to husbandmen and shepherds and
bee-keepers, and to the guardians and superintendents of their
implements; and he has already legislated for greater matters, as
for example, respecting marriage and the procreation and nurture of
children, and for education, and the establishment of offices--and
now he must direct his laws to those who provide food and labour in
preparing it.

let us first of all, then, have a class of laws which shall be called
the laws of husbandmen. and let the first of them be the law of zeus,
the god of boundaries. let no one shift the boundary line either of a
fellow-citizen who is a neighbour, or, if he dwells at the extremity of
the land, of any stranger who is conterminous with him, considering
that this is truly 'to move the immovable,' and every one should be more
willing to move the largest rock which is not a landmark, than the
least stone which is the sworn mark of friendship and hatred between
neighbours; for zeus, the god of kindred, is the witness of the citizen,
and zeus, the god of strangers, of the stranger, and when aroused,
terrible are the wars which they stir up. he who obeys the law will
never know the fatal consequences of disobedience, but he who despises
the law shall be liable to a double penalty, the first coming from the
gods, and the second from the law. for let no one wilfully remove the
boundaries of his neighbour's land, and if any one does, let him who
will inform the landowners, and let them bring him into court, and if
he be convicted of re-dividing the land by stealth or by force, let the
court determine what he ought to suffer or pay. in the next place,
many small injuries done by neighbours to one another, through their
multiplication, may cause a weight of enmity, and make neighbourhood
a very disagreeable and bitter thing. wherefore a man ought to be very
careful of committing any offence against his neighbour, and especially
of encroaching on his neighbour's land; for any man may easily do harm,
but not every man can do good to another. he who encroaches on his
neighbour's land, and transgresses his boundaries, shall make good the
damage, and, to cure him of his impudence and also of his meanness, he
shall pay a double penalty to the injured party. of these and the like
matters the wardens of the country shall take cognizance, and be the
judges of them and assessors of the damage; in the more important cases,
as has been already said, the whole number of them belonging to any
one of the twelve divisions shall decide, and in the lesser cases the
commanders: or, again, if any one pastures his cattle on his neighbour's
land, they shall see the injury, and adjudge the penalty. and if any
one, by decoying the bees, gets possession of another's swarms, and
draws them to himself by making noises, he shall pay the damage; or if
any one sets fire to his own wood and takes no care of his neighbour's
property, he shall be fined at the discretion of the magistrates. and
if in planting he does not leave a fair distance between his own and
his neighbour's land, he shall be punished, in accordance with the
enactments of many lawgivers, which we may use, not deeming it necessary
that the great legislator of our state should determine all the trifles
which might be decided by any body; for example, husbandmen have had of
old excellent laws about waters, and there is no reason why we should
propose to divert their course: he who likes may draw water from the
fountain-head of the common stream on to his own land, if he do not cut
off the spring which clearly belongs to some other owner; and he may
take the water in any direction which he pleases, except through a house
or temple or sepulchre, but he must be careful to do no harm beyond the
channel. and if there be in any place a natural dryness of the earth,
which keeps in the rain from heaven, and causes a deficiency in the
supply of water, let him dig down on his own land as far as the clay,
and if at this depth he finds no water, let him obtain water from his
neighbours, as much as is required for his servants' drinking, and if
his neighbours, too, are limited in their supply, let him have a fixed
measure, which shall be determined by the wardens of the country.
this he shall receive each day, and on these terms have a share of his
neighbours' water. if there be heavy rain, and one of those on the lower
ground injures some tiller of the upper ground, or some one who has a
common wall, by refusing to give them an outlet for water; or, again,
if some one living on the higher ground recklessly lets off the water on
his lower neighbour, and they cannot come to terms with one another, let
him who will call in a warden of the city, if he be in the city, or
if he be in the country, a warden of the country, and let him obtain
a decision determining what each of them is to do. and he who will not
abide by the decision shall suffer for his malignant and morose temper,
and pay a fine to the injured party, equivalent to double the value of
the injury, because he was unwilling to submit to the magistrates.

now the participation of fruits shall be ordered on this wise. the
goddess of autumn has two gracious gifts: one the joy of dionysus which
is not treasured up; the other, which nature intends to be stored. let
this be the law, then, concerning the fruits of autumn: he who tastes
the common or storing fruits of autumn, whether grapes or figs, before
the season of vintage which coincides with arcturus, either on his own
land or on that of others--let him pay fifty drachmae, which shall be
sacred to dionysus, if he pluck them from his own land; and if from his
neighbour's land, a mina, and if from any others', two-thirds of a mina.
and he who would gather the 'choice' grapes or the 'choice' figs, as
they are now termed, if he take them off his own land, let him pluck
them how and when he likes; but if he take them from the ground of
others without their leave, let him in that case be always punished in
accordance with the law which ordains that he should not move what
he has not laid down. and if a slave touches any fruit of this sort,
without the consent of the owner of the land, he shall be beaten with
as many blows as there are grapes on the bunch, or figs on the fig-tree.
let a metic purchase the 'choice' autumnal fruit, and then, if he
pleases, he may gather it; but if a stranger is passing along the road,
and desires to eat, let him take of the 'choice' grape for himself and
a single follower without payment, as a tribute of hospitality. the law
however forbids strangers from sharing in the sort which is not used for
eating; and if any one, whether he be master or slave, takes of them
in ignorance, let the slave be beaten, and the freeman dismissed with
admonitions, and instructed to take of the other autumnal fruits which
are unfit for making raisins and wine, or for laying by as dried figs.
as to pears, and apples, and pomegranates, and similar fruits, there
shall be no disgrace in taking them secretly; but he who is caught, if
he be of less than thirty years of age, shall be struck and beaten off,
but not wounded; and no freeman shall have any right of satisfaction for
such blows. of these fruits the stranger may partake, just as he may of
the fruits of autumn. and if an elder, who is more than thirty years of
age, eat of them on the spot, let him, like the stranger, be allowed to
partake of all such fruits, but he must carry away nothing. if, however,
he will not obey the law, let him run the risk of failing in the
competition of virtue, in case any one takes notice of his actions
before the judges at the time.

water is the greatest element of nutrition in gardens, but is easily
polluted. you cannot poison the soil, or the sun, or the air, which
are the other elements of nutrition in plants, or divert them, or steal
them; but all these things may very likely happen in regard to water,
which must therefore be protected by law. and let this be the law: if
any one intentionally pollutes the water of another, whether the water
of a spring, or collected in reservoirs, either by poisonous substances,
or by digging, or by theft, let the injured party bring the cause before
the wardens of the city, and claim in writing the value of the loss;
if the accused be found guilty of injuring the water by deleterious
substances, let him not only pay damages, but purify the stream or the
cistern which contains the water, in such manner as the laws of the
interpreters order the purification to be made by the offender in each
case.

with respect to the gathering in of the fruits of the soil, let a man,
if he pleases, carry his own fruits through any place in which he either
does no harm to any one, or himself gains three times as much as
his neighbour loses. now of these things the magistrates should be
cognizant, as of all other things in which a man intentionally does
injury to another or to the property of another, by fraud or force,
in the use which he makes of his own property. all these matters a man
should lay before the magistrates, and receive damages, supposing the
injury to be not more than three minae; or if he have a charge against
another which involves a larger amount, let him bring his suit into
the public courts and have the evil-doer punished. but if any of the
magistrates appear to adjudge the penalties which he imposes in an
unjust spirit, let him be liable to pay double to the injured party.
any one may bring the offences of magistrates, in any particular case,
before the public courts. there are innumerable little matters relating
to the modes of punishment, and applications for suits, and summonses
and the witnesses to summonses--for example, whether two witnesses
should be required for a summons, or how many--and all such details,
which cannot be omitted in legislation, but are beneath the wisdom of an
aged legislator. these lesser matters, as they indeed are in comparison
with the greater ones, let a younger generation regulate by law, after
the patterns which have preceded, and according to their own experience
of the usefulness and necessity of such laws; and when they are duly
regulated let there be no alteration, but let the citizens live in the
observance of them.

now of artisans, let the regulations be as follows: in the first place,
let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied in handicraft arts;
for he who is to secure and preserve the public order of the state, has
an art which requires much study and many kinds of knowledge, and does
not admit of being made a secondary occupation; and hardly any human
being is capable of pursuing two professions or two arts rightly, or
of practising one art himself, and superintending some one else who is
practising another. let this, then, be our first principle in the
state: no one who is a smith shall also be a carpenter, and if he be a
carpenter, he shall not superintend the smith's art rather than his own,
under the pretext that in superintending many servants who are working
for him, he is likely to superintend them better, because more revenue
will accrue to him from them than from his own art; but let every man in
the state have one art, and get his living by that. let the wardens of
the city labour to maintain this law, and if any citizen incline to
any other art rather than the study of virtue, let them punish him
with disgrace and infamy, until they bring him back into his own right
course; and if any stranger profess two arts, let them chastise him
with bonds and money penalties, and expulsion from the state, until they
compel him to be one only and not many.

but as touching payments for hire, and contracts of work, or in case any
one does wrong to any of the citizens, or they do wrong to any other, up
to fifty drachmae, let the wardens of the city decide the case; but if a
greater amount be involved, then let the public courts decide according
to law. let no one pay any duty either on the importation or exportation
of goods; and as to frankincense and similar perfumes, used in the
service of the gods, which come from abroad, and purple and other dyes
which are not produced in the country, or the materials of any art which
have to be imported, and which are not necessary--no one should import
them; nor, again, should any one export anything which is wanted in
the country. of all these things let there be inspectors and
superintendents, taken from the guardians of the law; and they shall be
the twelve next in order to the five seniors. concerning arms, and all
implements which are required for military purposes, if there be need
of introducing any art, or plant, or metal, or chains of any kind, or
animals for use in war, let the commanders of the horse and the generals
have authority over their importation and exportation; the city shall
send them out and also receive them, and the guardians of the law shall
make fit and proper laws about them. but let there be no retail trade
for the sake of moneymaking, either in these or any other articles, in
the city or country at all.

with respect to food and the distribution of the produce of the country,
the right and proper way seems to be nearly that which is the custom of
crete; for all should be required to distribute the fruits of the soil
into twelve parts, and in this way consume them. let the twelfth portion
of each as for instance of wheat and barley, to which the rest of the
fruits of the earth shall be added, as well as the animals which are for
sale in each of the twelve divisions, be divided in due proportion into
three parts; one part for freemen, another for their servants, and a
third for craftsmen and in general for strangers, whether sojourners who
may be dwelling in the city, and like other men must live, or those
who come on some business which they have with the state, or with some
individual. let only this third part of all necessaries be required to
be sold; out of the other two-thirds no one shall be compelled to
sell. and how will they be best distributed? in the first place, we see
clearly that the distribution will be of equals in one point of view,
and in another point of view of unequals.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: i mean that the earth of necessity produces and nourishes the
various articles of food, sometimes better and sometimes worse.

cleinias: of course.

athenian: such being the case, let no one of the three portions be
greater than either of the other two--neither that which is assigned
to masters or to slaves, nor again that of the stranger; but let the
distribution to all be equal and alike, and let every citizen take his
two portions and distribute them among slaves and freemen, he having
power to determine the quantity and quality. and what remains he shall
distribute by measure and number among the animals who have to be
sustained from the earth, taking the whole number of them.

in the second place, our citizens should have separate houses duly
ordered; and this will be the order proper for men like them. there
shall be twelve hamlets, one in the middle of each twelfth portion,
and in each hamlet they shall first set apart a market-place, and the
temples of the gods, and of their attendant demi-gods; and if there
be any local deities of the magnetes, or holy seats of other ancient
deities, whose memory has been preserved, to these let them pay their
ancient honours. but hestia, and zeus, and athene will have temples
everywhere together with the god who presides in each of the twelve
districts. and the first erection of houses shall be around these
temples, where the ground is highest, in order to provide the safest
and most defensible place of retreat for the guards. all the rest of
the country they shall settle in the following manner: they shall make
thirteen divisions of the craftsmen; one of them they shall establish
in the city, and this, again, they shall subdivide into twelve lesser
divisions, among the twelve districts of the city, and the remainder
shall be distributed in the country round about; and in each village
they shall settle various classes of craftsmen, with a view to the
convenience of the husbandmen. and the chief officers of the wardens
of the country shall superintend all these matters, and see how many of
them, and which class of them, each place requires; and fix them
where they are likely to be least troublesome, and most useful to the
husbandman. and the wardens of the city shall see to similar matters in
the city.

now the wardens of the agora ought to see to the details of the agora.
their first care, after the temples which are in the agora have been
seen to, should be to prevent any one from doing any wrong in dealings
between man and man; in the second place, as being inspectors of
temperance and violence, they should chastise him who requires
chastisement. touching articles of sale, they should first see whether
the articles which the citizens are under regulations to sell to
strangers are sold to them, as the law ordains. and let the law be as
follows: on the first day of the month, the persons in charge, whoever
they are, whether strangers or slaves, who have the charge on behalf of
the citizens, shall produce to the strangers the portion which falls to
them, in the first place, a twelfth portion of the corn--the stranger
shall purchase corn for the whole month, and other cereals, on the first
market day; and on the tenth day of the month the one party shall sell,
and the other buy, liquids sufficient to last during the whole month;
and on the twenty-third day there shall be a sale of animals by those
who are willing to sell to the people who want to buy, and of implements
and other things which husbandmen sell, (such as skins and all kinds of
clothing, either woven or made of felt and other goods of the same sort)
and which strangers are compelled to buy and purchase of others. as to
the retail trade in these things, whether of barley or wheat set apart
for meal and flour, or any other kind of food, no one shall sell them
to citizens or their slaves, nor shall any one buy of a citizen; but let
the stranger sell them in the market of strangers, to artisans and their
slaves, making an exchange of wine and food, which is commonly called
retail trade. and butchers shall offer for sale parts of dismembered
animals to the strangers, and artisans, and their servants. let any
stranger who likes buy fuel from day to day wholesale, from those who
have the care of it in the country, and let him sell to the strangers as
much as he pleases and when he pleases. as to other goods and implements
which are likely to be wanted, they shall sell them in the common
market, at any place which the guardians of the law and the wardens
of the market and city, choosing according to their judgment, shall
determine; at such places they shall exchange money for goods, and goods
for money, neither party giving credit to the other; and he who gives
credit must be satisfied, whether he obtain his money or not, for in
such exchanges he will not be protected by law. but whenever property
has been bought or sold, greater in quantity or value than is allowed by
the law, which has determined within what limits a man may increase and
diminish his possessions, let the excess be registered in the books
of the guardians of the law; or in case of diminution, let there be an
erasure made. and let the same rule be observed about the registration
of the property of the metics. any one who likes may come and be a metic
on certain conditions; a foreigner, if he likes, and is able to settle,
may dwell in the land, but he must practise an art, and not abide more
than twenty years from the time at which he has registered himself; and
he shall pay no sojourner's tax, however small, except good conduct,
nor any other tax for buying and selling. but when the twenty years have
expired, he shall take his property with him and depart. and if in the
course of these years he should chance to distinguish himself by any
considerable benefit which he confers on the state, and he thinks that
he can persuade the council and assembly, either to grant him delay
in leaving the country, or to allow him to remain for the whole of his
life, let him go and persuade the city, and whatever they assent to at
his instance shall take effect. for the children of the metics, being
artisans, and of fifteen years of age, let the time of their sojourn
commence after their fifteenth year; and let them remain for twenty
years, and then go where they like; but any of them who wishes to
remain, may do so, if he can persuade the council and assembly. and if
he depart, let him erase all the entries which have been made by him in
the register kept by the magistrates.




book ix.

next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural order of
legislation will come suits of law. of suits those which relate to
agriculture have been already described, but the more important have not
been described. having mentioned them severally under their usual names,
we will proceed to say what punishments are to be inflicted for each
offence, and who are to be the judges of them.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: there is a sense of disgrace in legislating, as we are about
to do, for all the details of crime in a state which, as we say, is
to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted to the practice of
virtue. to assume that in such a state there will arise some one who
will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any which are ever perpetrated
in other states, and that we must legislate for him by anticipation, and
threaten and make laws against him if he should arise, in order to deter
him, and punish his acts, under the idea that he will arise--this, as i
was saying, is in a manner disgraceful. yet seeing that we are not
like the ancient legislators, who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods,
being, according to the popular belief, themselves the offspring of the
gods, and legislating for others, who were also the children of divine
parents, but that we are only men who are legislating for the sons of
men, there is no uncharitableness in apprehending that some one of our
citizens may be like a seed which has touched the ox's horn, having a
heart so hard that it cannot be softened any more than those seeds can
be softened by fire. among our citizens there may be those who cannot be
subdued by all the strength of the laws; and for their sake, though
an ungracious task, i will proclaim my first law about the robbing of
temples, in case any one should dare to commit such a crime. i do not
expect or imagine that any well-brought-up citizen will ever take the
infection, but their servants, and strangers, and strangers' servants
may be guilty of many impieties. and with a view to them especially,
and yet not without a provident eye to the weakness of human nature
generally, i will proclaim the law about robbers of temples and similar
incurable, or almost incurable, criminals. having already agreed that
such enactments ought always to have a short prelude, we may speak to
the criminal, whom some tormenting desire by night and by day tempts
to go and rob a temple, the fewest possible words of admonition and
exhortation: o sir, we will say to him, the impulse which moves you to
rob temples is not an ordinary human malady, nor yet a visitation
of heaven, but a madness which is begotten in a man from ancient and
unexpiated crimes of his race, an ever-recurring curse--against this you
must guard with all your might, and how you are to guard we will explain
to you. when any such thought comes into your mind, go and perform
expiations, go as a suppliant to the temples of the gods who avert
evils, go to the society of those who are called good men among you;
hear them tell and yourself try to repeat after them, that every man
should honour the noble and the just. fly from the company of the
wicked--fly and turn not back; and if your disorder is lightened by
these remedies, well and good, but if not, then acknowledge death to be
nobler than life, and depart hence.

such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts of unholy
and treasonable actions, and to him who hearkens to them the law has
nothing to say. but to him who is disobedient when the prelude is over,
cry with a loud voice--he who is taken in the act of robbing temples, if
he be a slave or stranger, shall have his evil deed engraven on his face
and hands, and shall be beaten with as many stripes as may seem good to
the judges, and be cast naked beyond the borders of the land. and if he
suffers this punishment he will probably return to his right mind and
be improved; for no penalty which the law inflicts is designed for evil,
but always makes him who suffers either better or not so much worse as
he would have been. but if any citizen be found guilty of any great or
unmentionable wrong, either in relation to the gods, or his parents,
or the state, let the judge deem him to be incurable, remembering that
after receiving such an excellent education and training from youth
upward, he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes. his punishment
shall be death, which to him will be the least of evils; and his example
will benefit others, if he perish ingloriously, and be cast beyond the
borders of the land. but let his children and family, if they avoid the
ways of their father, have glory, and let honourable mention be made of
them, as having nobly and manfully escaped out of evil into good. none
of them should have their goods confiscated to the state, for the lots
of the citizens ought always to continue the same and equal.

touching the exaction of penalties, when a man appears to have done
anything which deserves a fine, he shall pay the fine, if he have
anything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him; but more than
that he shall not pay. and to secure exactness, let the guardians of the
law refer to the registers, and inform the judges of the precise truth,
in order that none of the lots may go uncultivated for want of money.
but if any one seems to deserve a greater penalty, let him undergo a
long and public imprisonment and be dishonoured, unless some of his
friends are willing to be surety for him, and liberate him by assisting
him to pay the fine. no criminal shall go unpunished, not even for a
single offence, nor if he have fled the country; but let the penalty be
according to his deserts--death, or bonds, or blows, or degrading places
of sitting or standing, or removal to some temple on the borders of the
land; or let him pay fines, as we said before. in cases of death, let
the judges be the guardians of the law, and a court selected by merit
from the last year's magistrates. but how the causes are to be brought
into court, how the summonses are to be served, and the like, these
things may be left to the younger generation of legislators to
determine; the manner of voting we must determine ourselves.

let the vote be given openly; but before they come to the vote let the
judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff and defendant,
and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take a serious
interest in listening to such causes. first of all the plaintiff shall
make one speech, and then the defendant shall make another; and after
the speeches have been made the eldest judge shall begin to examine
the parties, and proceed to make an adequate enquiry into what has been
said; and after the oldest has spoken, the rest shall proceed in order
to examine either party as to what he finds defective in the evidence,
whether of statement or omission; and he who has nothing to ask shall
hand over the examination to another. and on so much of what has been
said as is to the purpose all the judges shall set their seals, and
place the writings on the altar of hestia. on the next day they shall
meet again, and in like manner put their questions and go through the
cause, and again set their seals upon the evidence; and when they have
three times done this, and have had witnesses and evidence enough, they
shall each of them give a holy vote, after promising by hestia that they
will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their power; and so they
shall put an end to the suit.

next, after what relates to the gods, follows what relates to the
dissolution of the state: whoever by permitting a man to power enslaves
the laws, and subjects the city to factions, using violence and stirring
up sedition contrary to law, him we will deem the greatest enemy of the
whole state. but he who takes no part in such proceedings, and, being
one of the chief magistrates of the state, has no knowledge of treason,
or, having knowledge of it, by reason of cowardice does not interfere on
behalf of his country, such an one we must consider nearly as bad. every
man who is worth anything will inform the magistrates, and bring the
conspirator to trial for making a violent and illegal attempt to change
the government. the judges of such cases shall be the same as of the
robbers of temples; and let the whole proceeding be carried on in the
same way, and the vote of the majority condemn to death. but let there
be a general rule, that the disgrace and punishment of the father is
not to be visited on the children, except in the case of some one whose
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather have successively undergone
the penalty of death. such persons the city shall send away with all
their possessions to the city and country of their ancestors, retaining
only and wholly their appointed lot. and out of the citizens who have
more than one son of not less than ten years of age, they shall select
ten whom their father or grandfather by the mother's or father's side
shall appoint, and let them send to delphi the names of those who are
selected, and him whom the god chooses they shall establish as heir
of the house which has failed; and may he have better fortune than his
predecessors!

cleinias: very good.

athenian: once more let there be a third general law respecting the
judges who are to give judgment, and the manner of conducting suits
against those who are tried on an accusation of treason; and as
concerning the remaining or departure of their descendants--there shall
be one law for all three, for the traitor, and the robber of temples,
and the subverter by violence of the laws of the state. for a thief,
whether he steal much or little, let there be one law, and one
punishment for all alike: in the first place, let him pay double the
amount of the theft if he be convicted, and if he have so much over and
above the allotment--if he have not, he shall be bound until he pay the
penalty, or persuade him who has obtained the sentence against him to
forgive him. but if a person be convicted of a theft against the state,
then if he can persuade the city, or if he will pay back twice the
amount of the theft, he shall be set free from his bonds.

cleinias: what makes you say, stranger, that a theft is all one, whether
the thief may have taken much or little, and either from sacred
or secular places--and these are not the only differences in
thefts--seeing, then, that they are of many kinds, ought not the
legislator to adapt himself to them, and impose upon them entirely
different penalties?

athenian: excellent. i was running on too fast, cleinias, and you
impinged upon me, and brought me to my senses, reminding me of what,
indeed, had occurred to my mind already, that legislation was never yet
rightly worked out, as i may say in passing. do you remember the image
in which i likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves who are
doctored by slaves? for of this you may be very sure, that if one of
those empirical physicians, who practise medicine without science, were
to come upon the gentleman physician talking to his gentleman patient,
and using the language almost of philosophy, beginning at the beginning
of the disease and discoursing about the whole nature of the body, he
would burst into a hearty laugh--he would say what most of those who
are called doctors always have at their tongue's end: foolish fellow, he
would say, you are not healing the sick man, but you are educating him;
and he does not want to be made a doctor, but to get well.

cleinias: and would he not be right?

athenian: perhaps he would; and he might remark upon us, that he who
discourses about laws, as we are now doing, is giving the citizens
education and not laws; that would be rather a telling observation.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: but we are fortunate.

cleinias: in what way?

athenian: inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws, but we may take
into consideration every form of government, and ascertain what is
best and what is most needful, and how they may both be carried into
execution; and we may also, if we please, at this very moment choose
what is best, or, if we prefer, what is most necessary--which shall we
do?

cleinias: there is something ridiculous, stranger, in our proposing such
an alternative, as if we were legislators, simply bound under some great
necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow. but we, as i may by
the grace of heaven affirm, like gatherers of stones or beginners of
some composite work, may gather a heap of materials, and out of this, at
our leisure, select what is suitable for our projected construction. let
us then suppose ourselves to be at leisure, not of necessity building,
but rather like men who are partly providing materials, and partly
putting them together. and we may truly say that some of our laws, like
stones, are already fixed in their places, and others lie at hand.

athenian: certainly, in that case, cleinias, our view of law will be
more in accordance with nature. for there is another matter affecting
legislators, which i must earnestly entreat you to consider.

cleinias: what is it?

athenian: there are many writings to be found in cities, and among
them there are discourses composed by legislators as well as by other
persons.

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: shall we give heed rather to the writings of those
others--poets and the like, who either in metre or out of metre have
recorded their advice about the conduct of life, and not to the writings
of legislators? or shall we give heed to them above all?

cleinias: yes; to them far above all others.

athenian: and ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold his
opinion about the beautiful, the good, and the just, and not to teach
what they are, and how they are to be pursued by those who intend to be
happy?

cleinias: certainly not.

athenian: and is it disgraceful for homer and tyrtaeus and other poets
to lay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and the
pursuits of men, but not so disgraceful for lycurgus and solon and
others who were legislators as well as writers? is it not true that of
all the writings to be found in cities, those which relate to laws, when
you unfold and read them, ought to be by far the noblest and the
best? and should not other writings either agree with them, or if they
disagree, be deemed ridiculous? we should consider whether the laws
of states ought not to have the character of loving and wise parents,
rather than of tyrants and masters, who command and threaten, and,
after writing their decrees on walls, go their ways; and whether, in
discoursing of laws, we should not take the gentler view of them which
may or may not be attainable--at any rate, we will show our readiness
to entertain such a view, and be prepared to undergo whatever may be the
result. and may the result be good, and if god be gracious, it will be
good!

cleinias: excellent; let us do as you say.

athenian: then we will now consider accurately, as we proposed, what
relates to robbers of temples, and all kinds of thefts, and offences in
general; and we must not be annoyed if, in the course of legislation,
we have enacted some things, and have not made up our minds about some
others; for as yet we are not legislators, but we may soon be. let us,
if you please, consider these matters.

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: concerning all things honourable and just, let us then
endeavour to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves, and how
far we are inconsistent, and how far the many, from whom at any rate we
should profess a desire to differ, agree and disagree among themselves.

cleinias: what are the inconsistencies which you observe in us?

athenian: i will endeavour to explain. if i am not mistaken, we are all
agreed that justice, and just men and things and actions, are all fair,
and, if a person were to maintain that just men, even when they are
deformed in body, are still perfectly beautiful in respect of the
excellent justice of their minds, no one would say that there was any
inconsistency in this.

cleinias: they would be quite right.

athenian: perhaps; but let us consider further, that if all things which
are just are fair and honourable, in the term 'all' we must include just
sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions.

cleinias: and what is the inference?

athenian: the inference is, that a just action in partaking of the just
partakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and must not a suffering which partakes of the just principle
be admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable, if the
argument is consistently carried out?

cleinias: true.

athenian: but then if we admit suffering to be just and yet
dishonourable, and the term 'dishonourable' is applied to justice, will
not the just and the honourable disagree?

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: a thing not difficult to understand; the laws which have been
already enacted would seem to announce principles directly opposed to
what we are saying.

cleinias: to what?

athenian: we had enacted, if i am not mistaken, that the robber of
temples, and he who was the enemy of law and order, might justly be put
to death, and we were proceeding to make divers other enactments of
a similar nature. but we stopped short, because we saw that these
sufferings are infinite in number and degree, and that they are, at
once, the most just and also the most dishonourable of all sufferings.
and if this be true, are not the just and the honourable at one time all
the same, and at another time in the most diametrical opposition?

cleinias: such appears to be the case.

athenian: in this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the language
of the many rend asunder the honourable and just.

cleinias: very true, stranger.

athenian: then now, cleinias, let us see how far we ourselves are
consistent about these matters.

cleinias: consistent in what?

athenian: i think that i have clearly stated in the former part of the
discussion, but if i did not, let me now state--

cleinias: what?

athenian: that all bad men are always involuntarily bad; and from this i
must proceed to draw a further inference.

cleinias: what is it?

athenian: that the unjust man may be bad, but that he is bad against his
will. now that an action which is voluntary should be done involuntarily
is a contradiction; wherefore he who maintains that injustice is
involuntary will deem that the unjust does injustice involuntarily.
i too admit that all men do injustice involuntarily, and if any
contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjust against
their will, and yet that many do injustice willingly, i do not agree
with him. but, then, how can i avoid being inconsistent with myself, if
you, cleinias, and you, megillus, say to me--well, stranger, if all this
be as you say, how about legislating for the city of the magnetes--shall
we legislate or not--what do you advise? certainly we will, i should
reply. then will you determine for them what are voluntary and what
are involuntary crimes, and shall we make the punishments greater of
voluntary errors and crimes and less for the involuntary? or shall we
make the punishment of all to be alike, under the idea that there is no
such thing as voluntary crime?

cleinias: very good, stranger; and what shall we say in answer to these
objections?

athenian: that is a very fair question. in the first place, let us--

cleinias: do what?

athenian: let us remember what has been well said by us already,
that our ideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and
contradictory. bearing this in mind, let us proceed to ask ourselves
once more whether we have discovered a way out of the difficulty. have
we ever determined in what respect these two classes of actions differ
from one another? for in all states and by all legislators whatsoever,
two kinds of actions have been distinguished--the one, voluntary, the
other, involuntary; and they have legislated about them accordingly. but
shall this new word of ours, like an oracle of god, be only spoken, and
get away without giving any explanation or verification of itself?
how can a word not understood be the basis of legislation? impossible.
before proceeding to legislate, then, we must prove that they are two,
and what is the difference between them, that when we impose the penalty
upon either, every one may understand our proposal, and be able in some
way to judge whether the penalty is fitly or unfitly inflicted.

cleinias: i agree with you, stranger; for one of two things is certain:
either we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary, or we must
show the meaning and truth of this statement.

athenian: of these two alternatives, the one is quite intolerable--not
to speak what i believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful and
unholy. but if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntary and
involuntary, i must endeavour to find some other distinction between
them.

cleinias: very true, stranger; there cannot be two opinions among us
upon that point.

athenian: reflect, then; there are hurts of various kinds done by the
citizens to one another in the intercourse of life, affording plentiful
examples both of the voluntary and involuntary.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: i would not have any one suppose that all these hurts are
injuries, and that these injuries are of two kinds--one, voluntary, and
the other, involuntary; for the involuntary hurts of all men are quite
as many and as great as the voluntary. and please to consider whether i
am right or quite wrong in what i am going to say; for i deny, cleinias
and megillus, that he who harms another involuntarily does him an injury
involuntarily, nor should i legislate about such an act under the idea
that i am legislating for an involuntary injury. but i should rather say
that such a hurt, whether great or small, is not an injury at all; and,
on the other hand, if i am right, when a benefit is wrongly conferred,
the author of the benefit may often be said to injure. for i maintain, o
my friends, that the mere giving or taking away of anything is not to be
described either as just or unjust; but the legislator has to consider
whether mankind do good or harm to one another out of a just principle
and intention. on the distinction between injustice and hurt he must
fix his eye; and when there is hurt, he must, as far as he can, make the
hurt good by law, and save that which is ruined, and raise up that
which is fallen, and make that which is dead or wounded whole. and when
compensation has been given for injustice, the law must always seek to
win over the doers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of
enmity to those of friendship.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: then as to unjust hurts (and gains also, supposing the
injustice to bring gain), of these we may heal as many as are capable
of being healed, regarding them as diseases of the soul; and the cure of
injustice will take the following direction.

cleinias: what direction?

athenian: when any one commits any injustice, small or great, the law
will admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like again,
or never voluntarily, or at any rate in a far less degree; and he must
in addition pay for the hurt. whether the end is to be attained by word
or action, with pleasure or pain, by giving or taking away privileges,
by means of fines or gifts, or in whatsoever way the law shall proceed
to make a man hate injustice, and love or not hate the nature of the
just--this is quite the noblest work of law. but if the legislator sees
any one who is incurable, for him he will appoint a law and a penalty.
he knows quite well that to such men themselves there is no profit in
the continuance of their lives, and that they would do a double good to
the rest of mankind if they would take their departure, inasmuch as they
would be an example to other men not to offend, and they would relieve
the city of bad citizens. in such cases, and in such cases only, the
legislator ought to inflict death as the punishment of offences.

cleinias: what you have said appears to me to be very reasonable, but
will you favour me by stating a little more clearly the difference
between hurt and injustice, and the various complications of the
voluntary and involuntary which enter into them?

athenian: i will endeavour to do as you wish: concerning the soul, thus
much would be generally said and allowed, that one element in her nature
is passion, which may be described either as a state or a part of her,
and is hard to be striven against and contended with, and by irrational
force overturns many things.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: and pleasure is not the same with passion, but has an opposite
power, working her will by persuasion and by the force of deceit in all
things.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: a man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause of crimes.
ignorance, however, may be conveniently divided by the legislator into
two sorts: there is simple ignorance, which is the source of lighter
offences, and double ignorance, which is accompanied by a conceit of
wisdom; and he who is under the influence of the latter fancies that he
knows all about matters of which he knows nothing. this second kind of
ignorance, when possessed of power and strength, will be held by the
legislator to be the source of great and monstrous crimes, but when
attended with weakness, will only result in the errors of children
and old men; and these he will treat as errors, and will make laws
accordingly for those who commit them, which will be the mildest and
most merciful of all laws.

cleinias: you are perfectly right.

athenian: we all of us remark of one man that he is superior to pleasure
and passion, and of another that he is inferior to them; and this is
true.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: but no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is
superior and another inferior to ignorance.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: we are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilment
of their will; although an individual may be often drawn by them in
opposite directions at the same time.

cleinias: yes, often.

athenian: and now i can define to you clearly, and without ambiguity,
what i mean by the just and unjust, according to my notion of them:
when anger and fear, and pleasure and pain, and jealousies and desires,
tyrannize over the soul, whether they do any harm or not--i call all
this injustice. but when the opinion of the best, in whatever part
of human nature states or individuals may suppose that to dwell, has
dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man, even if it be
sometimes mistaken, yet what is done in accordance therewith, and the
principle in individuals which obeys this rule, and is best for the
whole life of man, is to be called just; although the hurt done by
mistake is thought by many to be involuntary injustice. leaving the
question of names, about which we are not going to quarrel, and having
already delineated three sources of error, we may begin by recalling
them somewhat more vividly to our memory: one of them was of the painful
sort, which we denominate anger and fear.

cleinias: quite right.

athenian: there was a second consisting of pleasures and desires, and a
third of hopes, which aimed at true opinion about the best. the latter
being subdivided into three, we now get five sources of actions, and for
these five we will make laws of two kinds.

cleinias: what are the two kinds?

athenian: there is one kind of actions done by violence and in the light
of day, and another kind of actions which are done in darkness and with
secret deceit, or sometimes both with violence and deceit; the laws
concerning these last ought to have a character of severity.

cleinias: naturally.

athenian: and now let us return from this digression and complete the
work of legislation. laws have been already enacted by us concerning the
robbers of the gods, and concerning traitors, and also concerning those
who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subverting the government. a
man may very likely commit some of these crimes, either in a state of
madness or when affected by disease, or under the influence of extreme
old age, or in a fit of childish wantonness, himself no better than
a child. and if this be made evident to the judges elected to try the
cause, on the appeal of the criminal or his advocate, and he be judged
to have been in this state when he committed the offence, he shall
simply pay for the hurt which he may have done to another; but he shall
be exempt from other penalties, unless he have slain some one, and have
on his hands the stain of blood. and in that case he shall go to another
land and country, and there dwell for a year; and if he return before
the expiration of the time which the law appoints, or even set his foot
at all on his native land, he shall be bound by the guardians of the law
in the public prison for two years, and then go free.

having begun to speak of homicide, let us endeavour to lay down
laws concerning every different kind of homicide; and, first of all,
concerning violent and involuntary homicides. if any one in an athletic
contest, and at the public games, involuntarily kills a friend, and
he dies either at the time or afterwards of the blows which he has
received; or if the like misfortune happens to any one in war, or
military exercises, or mimic contests of which the magistrates enjoin
the practice, whether with or without arms, when he has been purified
according to the law brought from delphi relating to these matters, he
shall be innocent. and so in the case of physicians: if their patient
dies against their will, they shall be held guiltless by the law. and if
one slay another with his own hand, but unintentionally, whether he be
unarmed or have some instrument or dart in his hand; or if he kill him
by administering food or drink, or by the application of fire or cold,
or by suffocating him, whether he do the deed by his own hand, or by the
agency of others, he shall be deemed the agent, and shall suffer one of
the following penalties: if he kill the slave of another in the belief
that he is his own, he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless
from loss, or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man,
which the judges shall assess; but purifications must be used greater
and more numerous than for those who committed homicide at the
games--what they are to be, the interpreters whom the god appoints shall
be authorised to declare. and if a man kills his own slave, when he has
been purified according to law, he shall be quit of the homicide. and
if a man kills a freeman unintentionally, he shall undergo the same
purification as he did who killed the slave. but let him not forget also
a tale of olden time, which is to this effect: he who has suffered a
violent end, when newly dead, if he has had the soul of a freeman in
life, is angry with the author of his death; and being himself full of
fear and panic by reason of his violent end, when he sees his murderer
walking about in his own accustomed haunts, he is stricken with terror
and becomes disordered, and this disorder of his, aided by the guilty
recollection of the other, is communicated by him with overwhelming
force to the murderer and his deeds. wherefore also the murderer must
go out of the way of his victim for the entire period of a year, and not
himself be found in any spot which was familiar to him throughout the
country. and if the dead man be a stranger, the homicide shall be
kept from the country of the stranger during a like period. if any one
voluntarily obeys this law, the next of kin to the deceased, seeing all
that has happened, shall take pity on him, and make peace with him,
and show him all gentleness. but if any one is disobedient, and either
ventures to go to any of the temples and sacrifice unpurified, or will
not continue in exile during the appointed time, the next of kin to the
deceased shall proceed against him for murder; and if he be convicted,
every part of his punishment shall be doubled. and if the next of kin
do not proceed against the perpetrator of the crime, then the pollution
shall be deemed to fall upon his own head--the murdered man will fix the
guilt upon his kinsman, and he who has a mind to proceed against him may
compel him to be absent from his country during five years, according
to law. if a stranger unintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in
the city, he who likes shall prosecute the cause according to the same
rules. if he be a metic, let him be absent for a year, or if he be an
entire stranger, in addition to the purification, whether he have slain
a stranger, or a metic, or a citizen, he shall be banished for life
from the country which is in possession of our laws. and if he return
contrary to law, let the guardians of the law punish him with death; and
let them hand over his property, if he have any, to him who is next
of kin to the sufferer. and if he be wrecked, and driven on the coast
against his will, he shall take up his abode on the seashore, wetting
his feet in the sea, and watching for an opportunity of sailing; but
if he be brought by land, and is not his own master, let the magistrate
whom he first comes across in the city, release him and send him
unharmed over the border.

if any one slays a freeman with his own hand, and the deed be done
in passion, in the case of such actions we must begin by making a
distinction. for a deed is done from passion either when men suddenly,
and without intention to kill, cause the death of another by blows and
the like on a momentary impulse, and are sorry for the deed immediately
afterwards; or again, when after having been insulted in deed or word,
men pursue revenge, and kill a person intentionally, and are not sorry
for the act. and, therefore, we must assume that these homicides are of
two kinds, both of them arising from passion, which may be justly said
to be in a mean between the voluntary and involuntary; at the same time,
they are neither of them anything more than a likeness or shadow
of either. he who treasures up his anger, and avenges himself, not
immediately and at the moment, but with insidious design, and after an
interval, is like the voluntary; but he who does not treasure up his
anger, and takes vengeance on the instant, and without malice prepense,
approaches to the involuntary; and yet even he is not altogether
involuntary, but is only the image or shadow of the involuntary;
wherefore about homicides committed in hot blood, there is a difficulty
in determining whether in legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary
or as partly involuntary. the best and truest view is to regard them
respectively as likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary, and
to distinguish them accordingly as they are done with or without
premeditation. and we should make the penalties heavier for those who
commit homicide with angry premeditation, and lighter for those who do
not premeditate, but smite upon the instant; for that which is like a
greater evil should be punished more severely, and that which is like
a less evil should be punished less severely: this shall be the rule of
our laws.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: let us proceed: if any one slays a freeman with his own hand,
and the deed be done in a moment of anger, and without premeditation,
let the offender suffer in other respects as the involuntary homicide
would have suffered, and also undergo an exile of two years, that he may
learn to school his passions. but he who slays another from passion, yet
with premeditation, shall in other respects suffer as the former; and
to this shall be added an exile of three instead of two years--his
punishment is to be longer because his passion is greater. the manner of
their return shall be on this wise: (and here the law has difficulty in
determining exactly; for in some cases the murderer who is judged by the
law to be the worse may really be the less cruel, and he who is judged
the less cruel may be really the worse, and may have executed the murder
in a more savage manner, whereas the other may have been gentler. but in
general the degrees of guilt will be such as we have described them. of
all these things the guardians of the law must take cognizance): when a
homicide of either kind has completed his term of exile, the guardians
shall send twelve judges to the borders of the land; these during the
interval shall have informed themselves of the actions of the criminals,
and they shall judge respecting their pardon and reception; and the
homicides shall abide by their judgment. but if after they have returned
home, any one of them in a moment of anger repeats the deed, let him be
an exile, and return no more; or if he returns, let him suffer as the
stranger was to suffer in a similar case. he who kills his own slave
shall undergo a purification, but if he kills the slave of another in
anger, he shall pay twice the amount of the loss to his owner. and
if any homicide is disobedient to the law, and without purification
pollutes the agora, or the games, or the temples, he who pleases may
bring to trial the next of kin to the dead man for permitting him, and
the murderer with him, and may compel the one to exact and the other to
suffer a double amount of fines and purifications; and the accuser shall
himself receive the fine in accordance with the law. if a slave in a fit
of passion kills his master, the kindred of the deceased man may do with
the murderer (provided only they do not spare his life) whatever they
please, and they will be pure; or if he kills a freeman, who is not
his master, the owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the
deceased, and they shall be under an obligation to put him to death,
but this may be done in any manner which they please. and if (which is
a rare occurrence, but does sometimes happen) a father or a mother in
a moment of passion slays a son or daughter by blows, or some other
violence, the slayer shall undergo the same purification as in other
cases, and be exiled during three years; but when the exile returns the
wife shall separate from the husband, and the husband from the wife, and
they shall never afterwards beget children together, or live under the
same roof, or partake of the same sacred rites with those whom they
have deprived of a child or of a brother. and he who is impious and
disobedient in such a case shall be brought to trial for impiety by any
one who pleases. if in a fit of anger a husband kills his wedded wife,
or the wife her husband, the slayer shall undergo the same purification,
and the term of exile shall be three years. and when he who has
committed any such crime returns, let him have no communication in
sacred rites with his children, neither let him sit at the same table
with them, and the father or son who disobeys shall be liable to be
brought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases. if a brother or
a sister in a fit of passion kills a brother or a sister, they shall
undergo purification and exile, as was the case with parents who killed
their offspring: they shall not come under the same roof, or share in
the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived of their brethren, or
of their children. and he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to
the law concerning impiety, which relates to these matters. if any one
is so violent in his passion against his parents, that in the madness
of his anger he dares to kill one of them, if the murdered person before
dying freely forgives the murderer, let him undergo the purification
which is assigned to those who have been guilty of involuntary homicide,
and do as they do, and he shall be pure. but if he be not acquitted, the
perpetrator of such a deed shall be amenable to many laws--he shall
be amenable to the extreme punishments for assault, and impiety, and
robbing of temples, for he has robbed his parent of life; and if a man
could be slain more than once, most justly would he who in a fit of
passion has slain father or mother, undergo many deaths. how can he,
whom, alone of all men, even in defence of his life, and when about to
suffer death at the hands of his parents, no law will allow to kill
his father or his mother who are the authors of his being, and whom the
legislator will command to endure any extremity rather than do this--how
can he, i say, lawfully receive any other punishment? let death then be
the appointed punishment of him who in a fit of passion slays his father
or his mother. but if brother kills brother in a civil broil, or under
other like circumstances, if the other has begun, and he only defends
himself, let him be free from guilt, as he would be if he had slain an
enemy; and the same rule will apply if a citizen kill a citizen, or
a stranger a stranger. or if a stranger kill a citizen or a citizen a
stranger in self-defence, let him be free from guilt in like manner; and
so in the case of a slave who has killed a slave; but if a slave have
killed a freeman in self-defence, let him be subject to the same law
as he who has killed a father; and let the law about the remission
of penalties in the case of parricide apply equally to every other
remission. whenever any sufferer of his own accord remits the guilt of
homicide to another, under the idea that his act was involuntary, let
the perpetrator of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile
for a year, according to law.

enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary and committed in
passion: we have now to speak of voluntary crimes done with injustice of
every kind and with premeditation, through the influence of pleasures,
and desires, and jealousies.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: let us first speak, as far as we are able, of their various
kinds. the greatest cause of them is lust, which gets the mastery of the
soul maddened by desire; and this is most commonly found to exist where
the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalent among the mass
of mankind: i mean where the power of wealth breeds endless desires of
never-to-be-satisfied acquisition, originating in natural disposition,
and a miserable want of education. of this want of education, the
false praise of wealth which is bruited about both among hellenes and
barbarians is the cause; they deem that to be the first of goods which
in reality is only the third. and in this way they wrong both posterity
and themselves, for nothing can be nobler and better than that the truth
about wealth should be spoken in all states--namely, that riches are for
the sake of the body, as the body is for the sake of the soul. they are
good, and wealth is intended by nature to be for the sake of them, and
is therefore inferior to them both, and third in order of excellence.
this argument teaches us that he who would be happy ought not to seek to
be rich, or rather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately, and
then there would be no murders in states requiring to be purged away
by other murders. but now, as i said at first, avarice is the chiefest
cause and source of the worst trials for voluntary homicide. a second
cause is ambition: this creates jealousies, which are troublesome
companions, above all to the jealous man himself, and in a less degree
to the chiefs of the state. and a third cause is cowardly and unjust
fear, which has been the occasion of many murders. when a man is doing
or has done something which he desires that no one should know him to be
doing or to have done, he will take the life of those who are likely to
inform of such things, if he have no other means of getting rid of them.
let this be said as a prelude concerning crimes of violence in general;
and i must not omit to mention a tradition which is firmly believed by
many, and has been received by them from those who are learned in the
mysteries: they say that such deeds will be punished in the world below,
and also that when the perpetrators return to this world they will pay
the natural penalty which is due to the sufferer, and end their lives in
like manner by the hand of another. if he who is about to commit murder
believes this, and is made by the mere prelude to dread such a penalty,
there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the law. but if
he will not listen, let the following law be declared and registered
against him: whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own
hand any of his kinsmen, shall in the first place be deprived of legal
privileges; and he shall not pollute the temples, or the agora, or the
harbours, or any other place of meeting, whether he is forbidden of men
or not; for the law, which represents the whole state, forbids him, and
always is and will be in the attitude of forbidding him. and if a cousin
or nearer relative of the deceased, whether on the male or female side,
does not prosecute the homicide when he ought, and have him proclaimed
an outlaw, he shall in the first place be involved in the pollution, and
incur the hatred of the gods, even as the curse of the law stirs up the
voices of men against him; and in the second place he shall be liable to
be prosecuted by any one who is willing to inflict retribution on behalf
of the dead. and he who would avenge a murder shall observe all the
precautionary ceremonies of lavation, and any others which the god
commands in cases of this kind. let him have proclamation made, and then
go forth and compel the perpetrator to suffer the execution of justice
according to the law. now the legislator may easily show that these
things must be accomplished by prayers and sacrifices to certain gods,
who are concerned with the prevention of murders in states. but who
these gods are, and what should be the true manner of instituting such
trials with due regard to religion, the guardians of the law, aided by
the interpreters, and the prophets, and the god, shall determine, and
when they have determined let them carry on the prosecution at law. the
cause shall have the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case
of those who plunder temples. let him who is convicted be punished with
death, and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered man, for
this would be shameless as well as impious. but if he fly and will not
stand his trial, let him fly for ever; or, if he set foot anywhere
on any part of the murdered man's country, let any relation of the
deceased, or any other citizen who may first happen to meet with him,
kill him with impunity, or bind and deliver him to those among the
judges of the case who are magistrates, that they may put him to death.
and let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he prosecutes; three
sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who try the cause
shall be provided by him, and they shall undertake to produce him at the
trial. but if he be unwilling or unable to provide sureties, then the
magistrates shall take him and keep him in bonds, and produce him at the
day of trial.

if a man do not commit a murder with his own hand, but contrives the
death of another, and is the author of the deed in intention and design,
and he continues to dwell in the city, having his soul not pure of
the guilt of murder, let him be tried in the same way, except in what
relates to the sureties; and also, if he be found guilty, his body after
execution may have burial in his native land, but in all other respects
his case shall be as the former; and whether a stranger shall kill a
citizen, or a citizen a stranger, or a slave a slave, there shall be
no difference as touching murder by one's own hand or by contrivance,
except in the matter of sureties; and these, as has been said, shall be
required of the actual murderer only, and he who brings the accusation
shall bind them over at the time. if a slave be convicted of slaying a
freeman voluntarily, either by his own hand or by contrivance, let the
public executioner take him in the direction of the sepulchre, to a
place whence he can see the tomb of the dead man, and inflict upon him
as many stripes as the person who caught him orders, and if he survive,
let him put him to death. and if any one kills a slave who has done no
wrong, because he is afraid that he may inform of some base and evil
deeds of his own, or for any similar reason, in such a case let him pay
the penalty of murder, as he would have done if he had slain a citizen.
there are things about which it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate,
but impossible not to legislate. if, for example, there should be
murders of kinsmen, either perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen, or by
their contrivance, voluntary and purely malicious, which most often
happen in ill-regulated and ill-educated states, and may perhaps occur
even in a country where a man would not expect to find them, we must
repeat once more the tale which we narrated a little while ago, in
the hope that he who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain
voluntarily on these grounds from murders which are utterly abominable.
for the myth, or saying, or whatever we ought to call it, has been
plainly set forth by priests of old; they have pronounced that the
justice which guards and avenges the blood of kindred, follows the
law of retaliation, and ordains that he who has done any murderous act
should of necessity suffer that which he has done. he who has slain a
father shall himself be slain at some time or other by his children--if
a mother, he shall of necessity take a woman's nature, and lose his life
at the hands of his offspring in after ages; for where the blood of a
family has been polluted there is no other purification, nor can the
pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which did the deed has
given life for life, and has propitiated and laid to sleep the wrath
of the whole family. these are the retributions of heaven, and by such
punishments men should be deterred. but if they are not deterred, and
any one should be incited by some fatality to deprive his father, or
mother, or brethren, or children, of life voluntarily and of purpose,
for him the earthly lawgiver legislates as follows: there shall be the
same proclamations about outlawry, and there shall be the same sureties
which have been enacted in the former cases. but in his case, if he be
convicted, the servants of the judges and the magistrates shall slay him
at an appointed place without the city where three ways meet, and there
expose his body naked, and each of the magistrates on behalf of the
whole city shall take a stone and cast it upon the head of the dead man,
and so deliver the city from pollution; after that, they shall bear him
to the borders of the land, and cast him forth unburied, according to
law. and what shall he suffer who slays him who of all men, as they
say, is his own best friend? i mean the suicide, who deprives himself
by violence of his appointed share of life, not because the law of the
state requires him, nor yet under the compulsion of some painful and
inevitable misfortune which has come upon him, nor because he has had
to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame, but who from sloth or
want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust penalty. for him, what
ceremonies there are to be of purification and burial god knows, and
about these the next of kin should enquire of the interpreters and of
the laws thereto relating, and do according to their injunctions. they
who meet their death in this way shall be buried alone, and none shall
be laid by their side; they shall be buried ingloriously in the borders
of the twelve portions of the land, in such places as are uncultivated
and nameless, and no column or inscription shall mark the place of their
interment. and if a beast of burden or other animal cause the death
of any one, except in the case of anything of that kind happening to
a competitor in the public contests, the kinsmen of the deceased shall
prosecute the slayer for murder, and the wardens of the country, such,
and so many as the kinsmen appoint, shall try the cause, and let the
beast when condemned be slain by them, and let them cast it beyond the
borders. and if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life, except in the
case of a thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent from the gods--whether
a man is killed by lifeless objects falling upon him, or by his falling
upon them, the nearest of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour to be
a judge, and thereby acquit himself and the whole family of guilt. and
he shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the border, as has been said
about the animals.

if a man is found dead, and his murderer be unknown, and after a
diligent search cannot be detected, there shall be the same proclamation
as in the previous cases, and the same interdict on the murderer; and
having proceeded against him, they shall proclaim in the agora by a
herald, that he who has slain such and such a person, and has been
convicted of murder, shall not set his foot in the temples, nor at all
in the country of the murdered man, and if he appears and is discovered,
he shall die, and be cast forth unburied beyond the border. let this one
law then be laid down by us about murder; and let cases of this sort be
so regarded.

and now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances the
murderer is rightly free from guilt: if a man catch a thief coming into
his house by night to steal, and he take and kill him, or if he slay
a footpad in self-defence, he shall be guiltless. and any one who does
violence to a free woman or a youth, shall be slain with impunity by the
injured person, or by his or her father or brothers or sons. if a man
find his wife suffering violence, he may kill the violator, and be
guiltless in the eye of the law; or if a person kill another in warding
off death from his father or mother or children or brethren or wife who
are doing no wrong, he shall assuredly be guiltless.

thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of man,
having which, he can, and without which, if he unfortunately be without
them, he cannot live; and also concerning the punishments which are
to be inflicted for violent deaths, let thus much be enacted. of the
nurture and education of the body we have spoken before, and next in
order we have to speak of deeds of violence, voluntary and involuntary,
which men do to one another; these we will now distinguish, as far as we
are able, according to their nature and number, and determine what will
be the suitable penalties of each, and so assign to them their proper
place in the series of our enactments. the poorest legislator will have
no difficulty in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out of
wounds should follow next in order after deaths. let wounds be divided
as homicides were divided--into those which are involuntary, and which
are given in passion or from fear, and those inflicted voluntarily
and with premeditation. concerning all this, we must make some such
proclamation as the following: mankind must have laws, and conform to
them, or their life would be as bad as that of the most savage beast.
and the reason of this is that no man's nature is able to know what is
best for human society; or knowing, always able and willing to do what
is best. in the first place, there is a difficulty in apprehending that
the true art of politics is concerned, not with private but with public
good (for public good binds together states, but private only distracts
them); and that both the public and private good as well of individuals
as of states is greater when the state and not the individual is first
considered. in the second place, although a person knows in the abstract
that this is true, yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible
power, he will never remain firm in his principles or persist in
regarding the public good as primary in the state, and the private good
as secondary. human nature will be always drawing him into avarice and
selfishness, avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure without any reason, and
will bring these to the front, obscuring the juster and better; and so
working darkness in his soul will at last fill with evils both him and
the whole city. for if a man were born so divinely gifted that he could
naturally apprehend the truth, he would have no need of laws to rule
over him; for there is no law or order which is above knowledge, nor can
mind, without impiety, be deemed the subject or slave of any man, but
rather the lord of all. i speak of mind, true and free, and in harmony
with nature. but then there is no such mind anywhere, or at least not
much; and therefore we must choose law and order, which are second
best. these look at things as they exist for the most part only, and
are unable to survey the whole of them. and therefore i have spoken as i
have.

and now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer who has
hurt or wounded another. any one may easily imagine the questions which
have to be asked in all such cases: what did he wound, or whom, or
how, or when? for there are innumerable particulars of this sort which
greatly vary from one another. and to allow courts of law to determine
all these things, or not to determine any of them, is alike impossible.
there is one particular which they must determine in all cases--the
question of fact. and then, again, that the legislator should not permit
them to determine what punishment is to be inflicted in any of these
cases, but should himself decide about all of them, small or great, is
next to impossible.

cleinias: then what is to be the inference?

athenian: the inference is, that some things should be left to courts of
law; others the legislator must decide for himself.

cleinias: and what ought the legislator to decide, and what ought he to
leave to the courts of law?

athenian: i may reply, that in a state in which the courts are bad
and mute, because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causes
clandestinely; or what is worse, when they are disorderly and noisy,
as in a theatre, clapping or hooting in turn this or that orator--i say
that then there is a very serious evil, which affects the whole state.
unfortunate is the necessity of having to legislate for such courts,
but where the necessity exists, the legislator should only allow them to
ordain the penalties for the smallest offences; if the state for which
he is legislating be of this character, he must take most matters into
his own hands and speak distinctly. but when a state has good
courts, and the judges are well trained and scrupulously tested, the
determination of the penalties or punishments which shall be inflicted
on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be left to them. and we are
not to be blamed for not legislating concerning all that large class
of matters which judges far worse educated than ours would be able to
determine, assigning to each offence what is due both to the perpetrator
and to the sufferer. we believe those for whom we are legislating to be
best able to judge, and therefore to them the greater part may be left.
at the same time, as i have often said, we should exhibit to the
judges, as we have done, the outline and form of the punishments to be
inflicted, and then they will not transgress the just rule. that was an
excellent practice, which we observed before, and which now that we are
resuming the work of legislation, may with advantage be repeated by us.

let the enactment about wounding be in the following terms: if any one
has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not his enemy, and
whom the law does not permit him to slay, and he wounds him, but is
unable to kill him, he who had the intent and has wounded him is not
to be pitied--he deserves no consideration, but should be regarded as
a murderer and be tried for murder. still having respect to the fortune
which has in a manner favoured him, and to the providence which in pity
to him and to the wounded man saved the one from a fatal blow, and the
other from an accursed fate and calamity--as a thank-offering to this
deity, and in order not to oppose his will--in such a case the law will
remit the punishment of death, and only compel the offender to emigrate
to a neighbouring city for the rest of his life, where he shall remain
in the enjoyment of all his possessions. but if he have injured the
wounded man, he shall make such compensation for the injury as the court
deciding the cause shall assess, and the same judges shall decide who
would have decided if the man had died of his wounds. and if a child
intentionally wound his parents, or a servant his master, death shall be
the penalty. and if a brother or a sister intentionally wound a brother
or a sister, and is found guilty, death shall be the penalty. and if a
husband wound a wife, or a wife a husband, with intent to kill, let him
or her undergo perpetual exile; if they have sons or daughters who are
still young, the guardians shall take care of their property, and have
charge of the children as orphans. if their sons are grown up, they
shall be under no obligation to support the exiled parent, but they
shall possess the property themselves. and if he who meets with such a
misfortune has no children, the kindred of the exiled man to the
degree of sons of cousins, both on the male and female side, shall meet
together, and after taking counsel with the guardians of the law and
the priests, shall appoint a 5040th citizen to be the heir of the house,
considering and reasoning that no house of all the 5040 belongs to
the inhabitant or to the whole family, but is the public and private
property of the state. now the state should seek to have its houses as
holy and happy as possible. and if any one of the houses be unfortunate,
and stained with impiety, and the owner leave no posterity, but dies
unmarried, or married and childless, having suffered death as the
penalty of murder or some other crime committed against the gods or
against his fellow-citizens, of which death is the penalty distinctly
laid down in the law; or if any of the citizens be in perpetual exile,
and also childless, that house shall first of all be purified and
undergo expiation according to law; and then let the kinsmen of the
house, as we were just now saying, and the guardians of the law, meet
and consider what family there is in the state which is of the highest
repute for virtue and also for good fortune, in which there are a number
of sons; from that family let them take one and introduce him to the
father and forefathers of the dead man as their son, and, for the sake
of the omen, let him be called so, that he may be the continuer of their
family, the keeper of their hearth, and the minister of their sacred
rites with better fortune than his father had; and when they have made
this supplication, they shall make him heir according to law, and the
offending person they shall leave nameless and childless and portionless
when calamities such as these overtake him.

now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another, but there is
a borderland which comes in between, preventing them from touching. and
we were saying that actions done from passion are of this nature, and
come in between the voluntary and involuntary. if a person be convicted
of having inflicted wounds in a passion, in the first place he shall
pay twice the amount of the injury, if the wound be curable, or, if
incurable, four times the amount of the injury; or if the wound be
curable, and at the same time cause great and notable disgrace to the
wounded person, he shall pay fourfold. and whenever any one in wounding
another injures not only the sufferer, but also the city, and makes him
incapable of defending his country against the enemy, he, besides the
other penalties, shall pay a penalty for the loss which the state has
incurred. and the penalty shall be, that in addition to his own times of
service, he shall serve on behalf of the disabled person, and shall take
his place in war; or, if he refuse, he shall be liable to be convicted
by law of refusal to serve. the compensation for the injury, whether to
be twofold or threefold or fourfold, shall be fixed by the judges who
convict him. and if, in like manner, a brother wounds a brother, the
parents and kindred of either sex, including the children of cousins,
whether on the male or female side, shall meet, and when they have
judged the cause, they shall entrust the assessment of damages to
the parents, as is natural; and if the estimate be disputed, then the
kinsmen on the male side shall make the estimate, or if they cannot,
they shall commit the matter to the guardians of the law. and when
similar charges of wounding are brought by children against their
parents, those who are more than sixty years of age, having children of
their own, not adopted, shall be required to decide; and if any one
is convicted, they shall determine whether he or she ought to die, or
suffer some other punishment either greater than death, or, at any rate,
not much less. a kinsman of the offender shall not be allowed to judge
the cause, not even if he be of the age which is prescribed by the law.
if a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman, the owner of the slave
shall give him up to the wounded man, who may do as he pleases with him,
and if he do not give him up he shall himself make good the injury.
and if any one says that the slave and the wounded man are conspiring
together, let him argue the point, and if he is cast, he shall pay for
the wrong three times over, but if he gains his case, the freeman who
conspired with the slave shall be liable to an action for kidnapping.
and if any one unintentionally wounds another he shall simply pay for
the harm, for no legislator is able to control chance. in such a case
the judges shall be the same as those who are appointed in the case of
children suing their parents; and they shall estimate the amount of the
injury.

all the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are deeds of
violence; and every man, woman, or child ought to consider that the
elder has the precedence of the younger in honour, both among the gods
and also among men who would live in security and happiness. wherefore
it is a foul thing and hateful to the gods to see an elder man assaulted
by a younger in the city, and it is reasonable that a young man when
struck by an elder should lightly endure his anger, laying up in store
for himself a like honour when he is old. let this be the law: every one
shall reverence his elder in word and deed; he shall respect any one who
is twenty years older than himself, whether male or female, regarding
him or her as his father or mother; and he shall abstain from laying
hands on any one who is of an age to have been his father or mother, out
of reverence to the gods who preside over birth; similarly he shall
keep his hands from a stranger, whether he be an old inhabitant or newly
arrived; he shall not venture to correct such an one by blows, either
as the aggressor or in self-defence. if he thinks that some stranger has
struck him out of wantonness or insolence, and ought to be punished, he
shall take him to the wardens of the city, but let him not strike him,
that the stranger may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting
up his hand against a citizen, and let the wardens of the city take
the offender and examine him, not forgetting their duty to the god of
strangers, and in case the stranger appears to have struck the citizen
unjustly, let them inflict upon him as many blows with the scourge as he
was himself inflicted, and quell his presumption. but if he be innocent,
they shall threaten and rebuke the man who arrested him, and let them
both go. if a person strikes another of the same age or somewhat older
than himself, who has no children, whether he be an old man who strikes
an old man or a young man who strikes a young man, let the person struck
defend himself in the natural way without a weapon and with his hands
only. he who, being more than forty years of age, dares to fight with
another, whether he be the aggressor or in self-defence, shall
be regarded as rude and ill-mannered and slavish--this will be a
disgraceful punishment, and therefore suitable to him. the obedient
nature will readily yield to such exhortations, but the disobedient,
who heeds not the prelude, shall have the law ready for him: if any man
smite another who is older than himself, either by twenty or by more
years, in the first place, he who is at hand, not being younger than the
combatants, nor their equal in age, shall separate them, or be disgraced
according to law; but if he be the equal in age of the person who is
struck or younger, he shall defend the person injured as he would a
brother or father or still older relative. further, let him who dares to
smite an elder be tried for assault, as i have said, and if he be found
guilty, let him be imprisoned for a period of not less than a year, or
if the judges approve of a longer period, their decision shall be final.
but if a stranger or metic smite one who is older by twenty years or
more, the same law shall hold about the bystanders assisting, and he who
is found guilty in such a suit, if he be a stranger but not resident,
shall be imprisoned during a period of two years; and a metic who
disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for three years, unless the court
assign him a longer term. and let him who was present in any of these
cases and did not assist according to law be punished, if he be of the
highest class, by paying a fine of a mina; or if he be of the second
class, of fifty drachmas; or if of the third class, by a fine of thirty
drachmas; or if he be of the fourth class, by a fine of twenty drachmas;
and the generals and taxiarchs and phylarchs and hipparchs shall form
the court in such cases.

laws are partly framed for the sake of good men, in order to instruct
them how they may live on friendly terms with one another, and partly
for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed, whose spirit cannot
be subdued, or softened, or hindered from plunging into evil. these are
the persons who cause the word to be spoken which i am about to utter;
for them the legislator legislates of necessity, and in the hope that
there may be no need of his laws. he who shall dare to lay violent hands
upon his father or mother, or any still older relative, having no fear
either of the wrath of the gods above, or of the punishments that are
spoken of in the world below, but transgresses in contempt of ancient
and universal traditions as though he were too wise to believe in them,
requires some extreme measure of prevention. now death is not the worst
that can happen to men; far worse are the punishments which are said to
pursue them in the world below. but although they are most true tales,
they work on such souls no prevention; for if they had any effect there
would be no slayers of mothers, or impious hands lifted up against
parents; and therefore the punishments of this world which are inflicted
during life ought not in such cases to fall short, if possible, of the
terrors of the world below. let our enactment then be as follows: if
a man dare to strike his father or his mother, or their fathers or
mothers, he being at the time of sound mind, then let any one who is
at hand come to the rescue as has been already said, and the metic or
stranger who comes to the rescue shall be called to the first place
in the games; but if he do not come he shall suffer the punishment of
perpetual exile. he who is not a metic, if he comes to the rescue, shall
have praise, and if he do not come, blame. and if a slave come to the
rescue, let him be made free, but if he do not come to the rescue, let
him receive 100 strokes of the whip, by order of the wardens of the
agora, if the occurrence take place in the agora; or if somewhere in the
city beyond the limits of the agora, any warden of the city who is in
residence shall punish him; or if in the country, then the commanders
of the wardens of the country. if those who are near at the time be
inhabitants of the same place, whether they be youths, or men, or women,
let them come to the rescue and denounce him as the impious one; and he
who does not come to the rescue shall fall under the curse of zeus, the
god of kindred and of ancestors, according to law. and if any one is
found guilty of assaulting a parent, let him in the first place be
forever banished from the city into the country, and let him abstain
from the temples; and if he do not abstain, the wardens of the country
shall punish him with blows, or in any way which they please, and if
he return he shall be put to death. and if any freeman eat or drink, or
have any other sort of intercourse with him, or only meeting him have
voluntarily touched him, he shall not enter into any temple, nor into
the agora, nor into the city, until he is purified; for he should
consider that he has become tainted by a curse. and if he disobeys the
law, and pollutes the city and the temples contrary to law, and one of
the magistrates sees him and does not indict him, when he gives in his
account this omission shall be a most serious charge.

if a slave strike a freeman, whether a stranger or a citizen, let
any one who is present come to the rescue, or pay the penalty already
mentioned; and let the bystanders bind him, and deliver him up to
the injured person, and he receiving him shall put him in chains, and
inflict on him as many stripes as he pleases; but having punished him he
must surrender him to his master according to law, and not deprive him
of his property. let the law be as follows: the slave who strikes a
freeman, not at the command of the magistrates, his owner shall receive
bound from the man whom he has stricken, and not release him until the
slave has persuaded the man whom he has stricken that he ought to be
released. and let there be the same laws about women in relation to
women, and about men and women in relation to one another.




book x.

and now having spoken of assaults, let us sum up all acts of violence
under a single law, which shall be as follows: no one shall take or
carry away any of his neighbour's goods, neither shall he use anything
which is his neighbour's without the consent of the owner; for these are
the offences which are and have been, and will ever be, the source
of all the aforesaid evils. the greatest of them are excesses and
insolences of youth, and are offences against the greatest when they are
done against religion; and especially great when in violation of public
and holy rites, or of the partly-common rites in which tribes and
phratries share; and in the second degree great when they are committed
against private rites and sepulchres, and in the third degree (not
to repeat the acts formerly mentioned), when insults are offered to
parents; the fourth kind of violence is when any one, regardless of the
authority of the rulers, takes or carries away or makes use of anything
which belongs to them, not having their consent; and the fifth kind
is when the violation of the civil rights of an individual demands
reparation. there should be a common law embracing all these cases. for
we have already said in general terms what shall be the punishment of
sacrilege, whether fraudulent or violent, and now we have to determine
what is to be the punishment of those who speak or act insolently toward
the gods. but first we must give them an admonition which may be in the
following terms: no one who in obedience to the laws believed that
there were gods, ever intentionally did any unholy act, or uttered
any unlawful word; but he who did must have supposed one of three
things--either that they did not exist--which is the first possibility,
or secondly, that, if they did, they took no care of man, or thirdly,
that they were easily appeased and turned aside from their purpose by
sacrifices and prayers.

cleinias: what shall we say or do to these persons?

athenian: my good friend, let us first hear the jests which i suspect
that they in their superiority will utter against us.

cleinias: what jests?

athenian: they will make some irreverent speech of this sort: 'o
inhabitants of athens, and sparta, and cnosus,' they will reply, 'in
that you speak truly; for some of us deny the very existence of the
gods, while others, as you say, are of opinion that they do not care
about us; and others that they are turned from their course by gifts.
now we have a right to claim, as you yourself allowed, in the matter of
laws, that before you are hard upon us and threaten us, you should argue
with us and convince us--you should first attempt to teach and persuade
us that there are gods by reasonable evidences, and also that they are
too good to be unrighteous, or to be propitiated, or turned from their
course by gifts. for when we hear such things said of them by those who
are esteemed to be the best of poets, and orators, and prophets, and
priests, and by innumerable others, the thoughts of most of us are
not set upon abstaining from unrighteous acts, but upon doing them and
atoning for them. when lawgivers profess that they are gentle and not
stern, we think that they should first of all use persuasion to us, and
show us the existence of gods, if not in a better manner than other men,
at any rate in a truer; and who knows but that we shall hearken to you?
if then our request is a fair one, please to accept our challenge.

cleinias: but is there any difficulty in proving the existence of the
gods?

athenian: how would you prove it?

cleinias: how? in the first place, the earth and the sun, and the stars
and the universe, and the fair order of the seasons, and the division of
them into years and months, furnish proofs of their existence, and also
there is the fact that all hellenes and barbarians believe in them.

athenian: i fear, my sweet friend, though i will not say that i much
regard, the contempt with which the profane will be likely to assail us.
for you do not understand the nature of their complaint, and you fancy
that they rush into impiety only from a love of sensual pleasure.

cleinias: why, stranger, what other reason is there?

athenian: one which you who live in a different atmosphere would never
guess.

cleinias: what is it?

athenian: a very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined to be the
greatest wisdom.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: at athens there are tales preserved in writing which the
virtue of your state, as i am informed, refuses to admit. they speak of
the gods in prose as well as verse, and the oldest of them tell of the
origin of the heavens and of the world, and not far from the beginning
of their story they proceed to narrate the birth of the gods, and how
after they were born they behaved to one another. whether these stories
have in other ways a good or a bad influence, i should not like to be
severe upon them, because they are ancient; but, looking at them with
reference to the duties of children to their parents, i cannot praise
them, or think that they are useful, or at all true. of the words of the
ancients i have nothing more to say; and i should wish to say of them
only what is pleasing to the gods. but as to our younger generation and
their wisdom, i cannot let them off when they do mischief. for do but
mark the effect of their words: when you and i argue for the existence
of the gods, and produce the sun, moon, stars, and earth, claiming for
them a divine being, if we would listen to the aforesaid philosophers we
should say that they are earth and stones only, which can have no care
at all of human affairs, and that all religion is a cooking up of words
and a make-believe.

cleinias: one such teacher, o stranger, would be bad enough, and you
imply that there are many of them, which is worse.

athenian: well, then; what shall we say or do? shall we assume that some
one is accusing us among unholy men, who are trying to escape from the
effect of our legislation; and that they say of us--how dreadful that
you should legislate on the supposition that there are gods! shall we
make a defence of ourselves? or shall we leave them and return to
our laws, lest the prelude should become longer than the law? for the
discourse will certainly extend to great length, if we are to treat the
impiously disposed as they desire, partly demonstrating to them at some
length the things of which they demand an explanation, partly making
them afraid or dissatisfied, and then proceed to the requisite
enactments.

cleinias: yes, stranger; but then how often have we repeated already
that on the present occasion there is no reason why brevity should be
preferred to length; for who is 'at our heels?' as the saying goes, and
it would be paltry and ridiculous to prefer the shorter to the better.
it is a matter of no small consequence, in some way or other to prove
that there are gods, and that they are good, and regard justice more
than men do. the demonstration of this would be the best and noblest
prelude of all our laws. and therefore, without impatience, and without
hurry, let us unreservedly consider the whole matter, summoning up all
the power of persuasion which we possess.

athenian: seeing you thus in earnest, i would fain offer up a prayer
that i may succeed: but i must proceed at once. who can be calm when he
is called upon to prove the existence of the gods? who can avoid hating
and abhorring the men who are and have been the cause of this argument;
i speak of those who will not believe the tales which they have heard as
babes and sucklings from their mothers and nurses, repeated by them
both in jest and earnest, like charms, who have also heard them in
the sacrificial prayers, and seen sights accompanying them--sights and
sounds delightful to children--and their parents during the sacrifices
showing an intense earnestness on behalf of their children and of
themselves, and with eager interest talking to the gods, and beseeching
them, as though they were firmly convinced of their existence; who
likewise see and hear the prostrations and invocations which are made by
hellenes and barbarians at the rising and setting of the sun and moon,
in all the vicissitudes of life, not as if they thought that there were
no gods, but as if there could be no doubt of their existence, and no
suspicion of their non-existence; when men, knowing all these things,
despise them on no real grounds, as would be admitted by all who have
any particle of intelligence, and when they force us to say what we are
now saying, how can any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of
them, when he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of the
gods? yet the attempt must be made; for it would be unseemly that one
half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure, and the other
half in their indignation at such persons. our address to these lost
and perverted natures should not be spoken in passion; let us suppose
ourselves to select some one of them, and gently reason with him,
smothering our anger: o my son, we will say to him, you are young, and
the advance of time will make you reverse many of the opinions which
you now hold. wait awhile, and do not attempt to judge at present of
the highest things; and that is the highest of which you now think
nothing--to know the gods rightly and to live accordingly. and in
the first place let me indicate to you one point which is of great
importance, and about which i cannot be deceived: you and your friends
are not the first who have held this opinion about the gods. there
have always been persons more or less numerous who have had the same
disorder. i have known many of them, and can tell you, that no one who
had taken up in youth this opinion, that the gods do not exist, ever
continued in the same until he was old; the two other notions certainly
do continue in some cases, but not in many; the notion, i mean, that the
gods exist, but take no heed of human things, and the other notion that
they do take heed of them, but are easily propitiated with sacrifices
and prayers. as to the opinion about the gods which may some day become
clear to you, i advise you to wait and consider if it be true or not;
ask of others, and above all of the legislator. in the meantime take
care that you do not offend against the gods. for the duty of the
legislator is and always will be to teach you the truth of these
matters.

cleinias: our address, stranger, thus far, is excellent.

athenian: quite true, megillus and cleinias, but i am afraid that we
have unconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine.

cleinias: what doctrine do you mean?

athenian: the wisest of all doctrines, in the opinion of many.

cleinias: i wish that you would speak plainer.

athenian: the doctrine that all things do become, have become, and will
become, some by nature, some by art, and some by chance.

cleinias: is not that true?

athenian: well, philosophers are probably right; at any rate we may as
well follow in their track, and examine what is the meaning of them and
their disciples.

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: they say that the greatest and fairest things are the work of
nature and of chance, the lesser of art, which, receiving from nature
the greater and primeval creations, moulds and fashions all those lesser
works which are generally termed artificial.

cleinias: how is that?

athenian: i will explain my meaning still more clearly. they say that
fire and water, and earth and air, all exist by nature and chance,
and none of them by art, and that as to the bodies which come next in
order--earth, and sun, and moon, and stars--they have been created
by means of these absolutely inanimate existences. the elements are
severally moved by chance and some inherent force according to certain
affinities among them--of hot with cold, or of dry with moist, or of
soft with hard, and according to all the other accidental admixtures of
opposites which have been formed by necessity. after this fashion and
in this manner the whole heaven has been created, and all that is in the
heaven, as well as animals and all plants, and all the seasons come from
these elements, not by the action of mind, as they say, or of any god,
or from art, but as i was saying, by nature and chance only. art sprang
up afterwards and out of these, mortal and of mortal birth, and produced
in play certain images and very partial imitations of the truth, having
an affinity to one another, such as music and painting create and their
companion arts. and there are other arts which have a serious purpose,
and these co-operate with nature, such, for example, as medicine, and
husbandry, and gymnastic. and they say that politics co-operate
with nature, but in a less degree, and have more of art; also that
legislation is entirely a work of art, and is based on assumptions which
are not true.

cleinias: how do you mean?

athenian: in the first place, my dear friend, these people would say
that the gods exist not by nature, but by art, and by the laws of
states, which are different in different places, according to the
agreement of those who make them; and that the honourable is one thing
by nature and another thing by law, and that the principles of justice
have no existence at all in nature, but that mankind are always
disputing about them and altering them; and that the alterations which
are made by art and by law have no basis in nature, but are of authority
for the moment and at the time at which they are made. these, my
friends, are the sayings of wise men, poets and prose writers, which
find a way into the minds of youth. they are told by them that the
highest right is might, and in this way the young fall into impieties,
under the idea that the gods are not such as the law bids them imagine;
and hence arise factions, these philosophers inviting them to lead a
true life according to nature, that is, to live in real dominion over
others, and not in legal subjection to them.

cleinias: what a dreadful picture, stranger, have you given, and how
great is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the ruin
both of states and families!

athenian: true, cleinias; but then what should the lawgiver do when
this evil is of long standing? should he only rise up in the state and
threaten all mankind, proclaiming that if they will not say and think
that the gods are such as the law ordains (and this may be extended
generally to the honourable, the just, and to all the highest things,
and to all that relates to virtue and vice), and if they will not make
their actions conform to the copy which the law gives them, then he
who refuses to obey the law shall die, or suffer stripes and bonds,
or privation of citizenship, or in some cases be punished by loss of
property and exile? should he not rather, when he is making laws for
men, at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion into his words,
and mitigate the severity of them as far as he can?

cleinias: why, stranger, if such persuasion be at all possible, then a
legislator who has anything in him ought never to weary of persuading
men; he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of the ancient opinion
that there are gods, and of all those other truths which you were
just now mentioning; he ought to support the law and also art, and
acknowledge that both alike exist by nature, and no less than nature, if
they are the creations of mind in accordance with right reason, as
you appear to me to maintain, and i am disposed to agree with you in
thinking.

athenian: yes, my enthusiastic cleinias; but are not these things when
spoken to a multitude hard to be understood, not to mention that they
take up a dismal length of time?

cleinias: why, stranger, shall we, whose patience failed not when
drinking or music were the themes of discourse, weary now of discoursing
about the gods, and about divine things? and the greatest help to
rational legislation is that the laws when once written down are always
at rest; they can be put to the test at any future time, and therefore,
if on first hearing they seem difficult, there is no reason for
apprehension about them, because any man however dull can go over them
and consider them again and again; nor if they are tedious but useful,
is there any reason or religion, as it seems to me, in any man refusing
to maintain the principles of them to the utmost of his power.

megillus: stranger, i like what cleinias is saying.

athenian: yes, megillus, and we should do as he proposes; for if impious
discourses were not scattered, as i may say, throughout the world, there
would have been no need for any vindication of the existence of the
gods--but seeing that they are spread far and wide, such arguments are
needed; and who should come to the rescue of the greatest laws, when
they are being undermined by bad men, but the legislator himself?

megillus: there is no more proper champion of them.

athenian: well, then, tell me, cleinias--for i must ask you to be my
partner--does not he who talks in this way conceive fire and water and
earth and air to be the first elements of all things? these he calls
nature, and out of these he supposes the soul to be formed afterwards;
and this is not a mere conjecture of ours about his meaning, but is what
he really means.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: then, by heaven, we have discovered the source of this vain
opinion of all those physical investigators; and i would have you
examine their arguments with the utmost care, for their impiety is
a very serious matter; they not only make a bad and mistaken use of
argument, but they lead away the minds of others: that is my opinion of
them.

cleinias: you are right; but i should like to know how this happens.

athenian: i fear that the argument may seem singular.

cleinias: do not hesitate, stranger; i see that you are afraid of such
a discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation. but if there
be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief that there are
gods, of whom the law is said now to approve, let us take this way, my
good sir.

athenian: then i suppose that i must repeat the singular argument of
those who manufacture the soul according to their own impious notions;
they affirm that which is the first cause of the generation and
destruction of all things, to be not first, but last, and that which is
last to be first, and hence they have fallen into error about the true
nature of the gods.

cleinias: still i do not understand you.

athenian: nearly all of them, my friends, seem to be ignorant of the
nature and power of the soul, especially in what relates to her origin:
they do not know that she is among the first of things, and before all
bodies, and is the chief author of their changes and transpositions. and
if this is true, and if the soul is older than the body, must not the
things which are of the soul's kindred be of necessity prior to those
which appertain to the body?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: then thought and attention and mind and art and law will be
prior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light; and the great
and primitive works and actions will be works of art; they will be
the first, and after them will come nature and works of nature, which
however is a wrong term for men to apply to them; these will follow, and
will be under the government of art and mind.

cleinias: but why is the word 'nature' wrong?

athenian: because those who use the term mean to say that nature is
the first creative power; but if the soul turn out to be the primeval
element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other
things the soul may be said to exist by nature; and this would be true
if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not otherwise.

cleinias: you are quite right.

athenian: shall we, then, take this as the next point to which our
attention should be directed?

cleinias: by all means.

athenian: let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument with
its youthful looks, beguiling us old men, give us the slip and make a
laughing-stock of us. who knows but we may be aiming at the greater, and
fail of attaining the lesser? suppose that we three have to pass a rapid
river, and i, being the youngest of the three and experienced in rivers,
take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by myself; leaving you
in safety on the bank, i am to examine whether the river is passable
by older men like yourselves, and if such appears to be the case then
i shall invite you to follow, and my experience will help to convey you
across; but if the river is impassable by you, then there will have been
no danger to anybody but myself--would not that seem to be a very fair
proposal? i mean to say that the argument in prospect is likely to be
too much for you, out of your depth and beyond your strength, and i
should be afraid that the stream of my questions might create in you who
are not in the habit of answering, giddiness and confusion of mind,
and hence a feeling of unpleasantness and unsuitableness might arise.
i think therefore that i had better first ask the questions and then
answer them myself while you listen in safety; in that way i can carry
on the argument until i have completed the proof that the soul is prior
to the body.

cleinias: excellent, stranger, and i hope that you will do as you
propose.

athenian: come, then, and if ever we are to call upon the gods, let us
call upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstration of
their own existence. and so holding fast to the rope we will venture
upon the depths of the argument. when questions of this sort are asked
of me, my safest answer would appear to be as follows: some one says to
me, 'o stranger, are all things at rest and nothing in motion, or is the
exact opposite of this true, or are some things in motion and others at
rest?' to this i shall reply that some things are in motion and others
at rest. 'and do not things which move move in a place, and are not the
things which are at rest at rest in a place?' certainly. 'and some move
or rest in one place and some in more places than one?' you mean to say,
we shall rejoin, that those things which rest at the centre move in one
place, just as the circumference goes round of globes which are said to
be at rest? 'yes.' and we observe that, in the revolution, the motion
which carries round the larger and the lesser circle at the same time
is proportionally distributed to greater and smaller, and is greater and
smaller in a certain proportion. here is a wonder which might be thought
an impossibility, that the same motion should impart swiftness and
slowness in due proportion to larger and lesser circles. 'very true.'
and when you speak of bodies moving in many places, you seem to me to
mean those which move from one place to another, and sometimes have
one centre of motion and sometimes more than one because they turn upon
their axis; and whenever they meet anything, if it be stationary, they
are divided by it; but if they get in the midst between bodies which are
approaching and moving towards the same spot from opposite directions,
they unite with them. 'i admit the truth of what you are saying.'
also when they unite they grow, and when they are divided they waste
away--that is, supposing the constitution of each to remain, or if that
fails, then there is a second reason of their dissolution. 'and when are
all things created and how?' clearly, they are created when the first
principle receives increase and attains to the second dimension, and
from this arrives at the one which is neighbour to this, and after
reaching the third becomes perceptible to sense. everything which is
thus changing and moving is in process of generation; only when at
rest has it real existence, but when passing into another state it is
destroyed utterly. have we not mentioned all motions that there are,
and comprehended them under their kinds and numbered them with the
exception, my friends, of two?

cleinias: which are they?

athenian: just the two, with which our present enquiry is concerned.

cleinias: speak plainer.

athenian: i suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul?

cleinias: very true.

athenian: let us assume that there is a motion able to move other
things, but not to move itself; that is one kind; and there is
another kind which can move itself as well as other things, working in
composition and decomposition, by increase and diminution and generation
and destruction--that is also one of the many kinds of motion.

cleinias: granted.

athenian: and we will assume that which moves other, and is changed by
other, to be the ninth, and that which changes itself and others, and
is coincident with every action and every passion, and is the true
principle of change and motion in all that is--that we shall be inclined
to call the tenth.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as being the
mightiest and most efficient?

cleinias: i must say that the motion which is able to move itself is ten
thousand times superior to all the others.

athenian: very good; but may i make one or two corrections in what i
have been saying?

cleinias: what are they?

athenian: when i spoke of the tenth sort of motion, that was not quite
correct.

cleinias: what was the error?

athenian: according to the true order, the tenth was really the first
in generation and power; then follows the second, which was strangely
enough termed the ninth by us.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: i mean this: when one thing changes another, and that another,
of such will there be any primary changing element? how can a thing
which is moved by another ever be the beginning of change? impossible.
but when the self-moved changes other, and that again other, and thus
thousands upon tens of thousands of bodies are set in motion, must
not the beginning of all this motion be the change of the self-moving
principle?

cleinias: very true, and i quite agree.

athenian: or, to put the question in another way, making answer to
ourselves: if, as most of these philosophers have the audacity
to affirm, all things were at rest in one mass, which of the
above-mentioned principles of motion would first spring up among them?

cleinias: clearly the self-moving; for there could be no change in them
arising out of any external cause; the change must first take place in
themselves.

athenian: then we must say that self-motion being the origin of all
motions, and the first which arises among things at rest as well as
among things in motion, is the eldest and mightiest principle of change,
and that which is changed by another and yet moves other is second.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: at this stage of the argument let us put a question.

cleinias: what question?

athenian: if we were to see this power existing in any earthy, watery,
or fiery substance, simple or compound--how should we describe it?

cleinias: you mean to ask whether we should call such a self-moving
power life?

athenian: i do.

cleinias: certainly we should.

athenian: and when we see soul in anything, must we not do the
same--must we not admit that this is life?

cleinias: we must.

athenian: and now, i beseech you, reflect--you would admit that we have
a threefold knowledge of things?

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: i mean that we know the essence, and that we know the
definition of the essence, and the name--these are the three; and there
are two questions which may be raised about anything.

cleinias: how two?

athenian: sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition;
or he may give the definition and ask the name. i may illustrate what i
mean in this way.

cleinias: how?

athenian: number like some other things is capable of being divided
into equal parts; when thus divided, number is named 'even,' and the
definition of the name 'even' is 'number divisible into two equal
parts'?

cleinias: true.

athenian: i mean, that when we are asked about the definition and
give the name, or when we are asked about the name and give the
definition--in either case, whether we give name or definition, we speak
of the same thing, calling 'even' the number which is divided into two
equal parts.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: and what is the definition of that which is named 'soul'? can
we conceive of any other than that which has been already given--the
motion which can move itself?

cleinias: you mean to say that the essence which is defined as the
self-moved is the same with that which has the name soul?

athenian: yes; and if this is true, do we still maintain that there
is anything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin
and moving power of all that is, or has become, or will be, and their
contraries, when she has been clearly shown to be the source of change
and motion in all things?

cleinias: certainly not; the soul as being the source of motion, has
been most satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all things.

athenian: and is not that motion which is produced in another, by reason
of another, but never has any self-moving power at all, being in truth
the change of an inanimate body, to be reckoned second, or by any lower
number which you may prefer?

cleinias: exactly.

athenian: then we are right, and speak the most perfect and absolute
truth, when we say that the soul is prior to the body, and that the body
is second and comes afterwards, and is born to obey the soul, which is
the ruler?

cleinias: nothing can be more true.

athenian: do you remember our old admission, that if the soul was prior
to the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of the body?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: then characters and manners, and wishes and reasonings, and
true opinions, and reflections, and recollections are prior to length
and breadth and depth and strength of bodies, if the soul is prior to
the body.

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: in the next place, we must not of necessity admit that the
soul is the cause of good and evil, base and honourable, just and
unjust, and of all other opposites, if we suppose her to be the cause of
all things?

cleinias: we must.

athenian: and as the soul orders and inhabits all things that move,
however moving, must we not say that she orders also the heavens?

cleinias: of course.

athenian: one soul or more? more than one--i will answer for you; at any
rate, we must not suppose that there are less than two--one the author
of good, and the other of evil.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: yes, very true; the soul then directs all things in heaven,
and earth, and sea by her movements, and these are described by the
terms--will, consideration, attention, deliberation, opinion true and
false, joy and sorrow, confidence, fear, hatred, love, and other primary
motions akin to these; which again receive the secondary motions of
corporeal substances, and guide all things to growth and decay, to
composition and decomposition, and to the qualities which accompany
them, such as heat and cold, heaviness and lightness, hardness and
softness, blackness and whiteness, bitterness and sweetness, and all
those other qualities which the soul uses, herself a goddess, when truly
receiving the divine mind she disciplines all things rightly to their
happiness; but when she is the companion of folly, she does the very
contrary of all this. shall we assume so much, or do we still entertain
doubts?

cleinias: there is no room at all for doubt.

athenian: shall we say then that it is the soul which controls heaven
and earth, and the whole world? that it is a principle of wisdom and
virtue, or a principle which has neither wisdom nor virtue? suppose that
we make answer as follows:

cleinias: how would you answer?

athenian: if, my friend, we say that the whole path and movement of
heaven, and of all that is therein, is by nature akin to the movement
and revolution and calculation of mind, and proceeds by kindred laws,
then, as is plain, we must say that the best soul takes care of the
world and guides it along the good path.

cleinias: true.

athenian: but if the world moves wildly and irregularly, then the evil
soul guides it.

cleinias: true again.

athenian: of what nature is the movement of mind? to this question it is
not easy to give an intelligent answer; and therefore i ought to assist
you in framing one.

cleinias: very good.

athenian: then let us not answer as if we would look straight at the
sun, making ourselves darkness at midday--i mean as if we were under the
impression that we could see with mortal eyes, or know adequately the
nature of mind--it will be safer to look at the image only.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chiefly
resembles; this i will bring to your recollection, and will then make
the answer on behalf of us all.

cleinias: that will be excellent.

athenian: you will surely remember our saying that all things were
either at rest or in motion?

cleinias: i do.

athenian: and that of things in motion some were moving in one place,
and others in more than one?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: of these two kinds of motion, that which moves in one place
must move about a centre like globes made in a lathe, and is most
entirely akin and similar to the circular movement of mind.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: in saying that both mind and the motion which is in one place
move in the same and like manner, in and about the same, and in relation
to the same, and according to one proportion and order, and are like the
motion of a globe, we invented a fair image, which does no discredit to
our ingenuity.

cleinias: it does us great credit.

athenian: and the motion of the other sort which is not after the same
manner, nor in the same, nor about the same, nor in relation to the
same, nor in one place, nor in order, nor according to any rule or
proportion, may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly?

cleinias: that is most true.

athenian: then, after what has been said, there is no difficulty in
distinctly stating, that since soul carries all things round, either the
best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round and order and
arrange the revolution of the heaven.

cleinias: and judging from what has been said, stranger, there would be
impiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or souls carries
round the heavens.

athenian: you have understood my meaning right well, cleinias, and now
let me ask you another question.

cleinias: what are you going to ask?

athenian: if the soul carries round the sun and moon, and the other
stars, does she not carry round each individual of them?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: then of one of them let us speak, and the same argument will
apply to all.

cleinias: which will you take?

athenian: every one sees the body of the sun, but no one sees his soul,
nor the soul of any other body living or dead; and yet there is great
reason to believe that this nature, unperceived by any of our senses, is
circumfused around them all, but is perceived by mind; and therefore by
mind and reflection only let us apprehend the following point.

cleinias: what is that?

athenian: if the soul carries round the sun, we shall not be far wrong
in supposing one of three alternatives.

cleinias: what are they?

athenian: either the soul which moves the sun this way and that, resides
within the circular and visible body, like the soul which carries us
about every way; or the soul provides herself with an external body
of fire or air, as some affirm, and violently propels body by body;
or thirdly, she is without such a body, but guides the sun by some
extraordinary and wonderful power.

cleinias: yes, certainly; the soul can only order all things in one of
these three ways.

athenian: and this soul of the sun, which is therefore better than the
sun, whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to men, or
acting from without, or in whatever way, ought by every man to be deemed
a god.

cleinias: yes, by every man who has the least particle of sense.

athenian: and of the stars too, and of the moon, and of the years and
months and seasons, must we not say in like manner, that since a soul
or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all of them,
those souls are gods, whether they are living beings and reside in
bodies, and in this way order the whole heaven, or whatever be the
place and mode of their existence--and will any one who admits all this
venture to deny that all things are full of gods?

cleinias: no one, stranger, would be such a madman.

athenian: and now, megillus and cleinias, let us offer terms to him who
has hitherto denied the existence of the gods, and leave him.

cleinias: what terms?

athenian: either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying that the
soul is the original of all things, and arguing accordingly; or, if he
be not able to say anything better, then he must yield to us and live
for the remainder of his life in the belief that there are gods. let us
see, then, whether we have said enough or not enough to those who deny
that there are gods.

cleinias: certainly, quite enough, stranger.

athenian: then to them we will say no more. and now we are to address
him who, believing that there are gods, believes also that they take no
heed of human affairs: to him we say--o thou best of men, in believing
that there are gods you are led by some affinity to them, which attracts
you towards your kindred and makes you honour and believe in them. but
the fortunes of evil and unrighteous men in private as well as public
life, which, though not really happy, are wrongly counted happy in
the judgment of men, and are celebrated both by poets and prose
writers--these draw you aside from your natural piety. perhaps you have
seen impious men growing old and leaving their children's children in
high offices, and their prosperity shakes your faith--you have known or
heard or been yourself an eyewitness of many monstrous impieties, and
have beheld men by such criminal means from small beginnings attaining
to sovereignty and the pinnacle of greatness; and considering all these
things you do not like to accuse the gods of them, because they are your
relatives; and so from some want of reasoning power, and also from an
unwillingness to find fault with them, you have come to believe that
they exist indeed, but have no thought or care of human things. now,
that your present evil opinion may not grow to still greater impiety,
and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjure away the
evil before it arrives, we will add another argument to that originally
addressed to him who utterly denied the existence of the gods. and do
you, megillus and cleinias, answer for the young man as you did before;
and if any impediment comes in our way, i will take the word out of your
mouths, and carry you over the river as i did just now.

cleinias: very good; do as you say, and we will help you as well as we
can.

athenian: there will probably be no difficulty in proving to him that
the gods care about the small as well as about the great. for he was
present and heard what was said, that they are perfectly good, and that
the care of all things is most entirely natural to them.

cleinias: no doubt he heard that.

athenian: let us consider together in the next place what we mean by
this virtue which we ascribe to them. surely we should say that to be
temperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue, and the contrary to
vice?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: yes; and courage is a part of virtue, and cowardice of vice?

cleinias: true.

athenian: and the one is honourable, and the other dishonourable?

cleinias: to be sure.

athenian: and the one, like other meaner things, is a human quality, but
the gods have no part in anything of the sort?

cleinias: that again is what everybody will admit.

athenian: but do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury to be
virtues? what do you think?

cleinias: decidedly not.

athenian: they rank under the opposite class?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: and their opposites, therefore, would fall under the opposite
class?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: but are we to suppose that one who possesses all these good
qualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle, like those whom the
poet compares to stingless drones?

cleinias: and the comparison is a most just one.

athenian: surely god must not be supposed to have a nature which he
himself hates? he who dares to say this sort of thing must not be
tolerated for a moment.

cleinias: of course not. how could he have?

athenian: should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in
praising any one who has some special business entrusted to him, if he
have a mind which takes care of great matters and no care of small ones?
reflect; he who acts in this way, whether he be god or man, must act
from one of two principles.

cleinias: what are they?

athenian: either he must think that the neglect of the small matters
is of no consequence to the whole, or if he knows that they are of
consequence, and he neglects them, his neglect must be attributed to
carelessness and indolence. is there any other way in which his neglect
can be explained? for surely, when it is impossible for him to take care
of all, he is not negligent if he fails to attend to these things
great or small, which a god or some inferior being might be wanting in
strength or capacity to manage?

cleinias: certainly not.

athenian: now, then, let us examine the offenders, who both alike
confess that there are gods, but with a difference--the one saying that
they may be appeased, and the other that they have no care of small
matters: there are three of us and two of them, and we will say to
them--in the first place, you both acknowledge that the gods hear and
see and know all things, and that nothing can escape them which is
matter of sense and knowledge: do you admit this?

cleinias: yes.

athenian: and do you admit also that they have all power which mortals
and immortals can have?

cleinias: they will, of course, admit this also.

athenian: and surely we three and they two--five in all--have
acknowledged that they are good and perfect?

cleinias: assuredly.

athenian: but, if they are such as we conceive them to be, can we
possibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessness
and indolence? for in us inactivity is the child of cowardice, and
carelessness of inactivity and indolence.

cleinias: most true.

athenian: then not from inactivity and carelessness is any god ever
negligent; for there is no cowardice in them.

cleinias: that is very true.

athenian: then the alternative which remains is, that if the gods
neglect the lighter and lesser concerns of the universe, they
neglect them because they know that they ought not to care about such
matters--what other alternative is there but the opposite of their
knowing?

cleinias: there is none.

athenian: and, o most excellent and best of men, do i understand you to
mean that they are careless because they are ignorant, and do not
know that they ought to take care, or that they know, and yet like the
meanest sort of men, knowing the better, choose the worse because they
are overcome by pleasures and pains?

cleinias: impossible.

athenian: do not all human things partake of the nature of soul? and is
not man the most religious of all animals?

cleinias: that is not to be denied.

athenian: and we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the property
of the gods, to whom also the whole of heaven belongs?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and, therefore, whether a person says that these things are to
the gods great or small--in either case it would not be natural for the
gods who own us, and who are the most careful and the best of owners, to
neglect us. there is also a further consideration.

cleinias: what is it?

athenian: sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other in
respect to their ease and difficulty.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: i mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearing
the small than the great, but more facility in moving and controlling
and taking care of small and unimportant things than of their opposites.

cleinias: far more.

athenian: suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able to
cure some living thing as a whole--how will the whole fare at his hands
if he takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which are
lesser?

cleinias: decidedly not well.

athenian: no better would be the result with pilots or generals, or
householders or statesmen, or any other such class, if they neglected
the small and regarded only the great--as the builders say, the larger
stones do not lie well without the lesser.

cleinias: of course not.

athenian: let us not, then, deem god inferior to human workmen, who, in
proportion to their skill, finish and perfect their works, small as well
as great, by one and the same art; or that god, the wisest of
beings, who is both willing and able to take care, is like a lazy
good-for-nothing, or a coward, who turns his back upon labour and gives
no thought to smaller and easier matters, but to the greater only.

cleinias: never, stranger, let us admit a supposition about the gods
which is both impious and false.

athenian: i think that we have now argued enough with him who delights
to accuse the gods of neglect.

cleinias: yes.

athenian: he has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error, but he
still seems to me to need some words of consolation.

cleinias: what consolation will you offer him?

athenian: let us say to the youth: the ruler of the universe has ordered
all things with a view to the excellence and preservation of the whole,
and each part, as far as may be, has an action and passion appropriate
to it. over these, down to the least fraction of them, ministers have
been appointed to preside, who have wrought out their perfection with
infinitesimal exactness. and one of these portions of the universe is
thine own, unhappy man, which, however little, contributes to the whole;
and you do not seem to be aware that this and every other creation is
for the sake of the whole, and in order that the life of the whole may
be blessed; and that you are created for the sake of the whole, and not
the whole for the sake of you. for every physician and every skilled
artist does all things for the sake of the whole, directing his effort
towards the common good, executing the part for the sake of the whole,
and not the whole for the sake of the part. and you are annoyed because
you are ignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to the
universe, as far as the laws of the common creation admit. now, as the
soul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes all
sorts of changes, either of herself, or through the influence of another
soul, all that remains to the player of the game is that he should shift
the pieces; sending the better nature to the better place, and the worse
to the worse, and so assigning to them their proper portion.

cleinias: in what way do you mean?

athenian: in a way which may be supposed to make the care of all things
easy to the gods. if any one were to form or fashion all things without
any regard to the whole--if, for example, he formed a living element of
water out of fire, instead of forming many things out of one or one out
of many in regular order attaining to a first or second or third birth,
the transmutation would have been infinite; but now the ruler of the
world has a wonderfully easy task.

cleinias: how so?

athenian: i will explain: when the king saw that our actions had life,
and that there was much virtue in them and much vice, and that the soul
and body, although not, like the gods of popular opinion, eternal, yet
having once come into existence, were indestructible (for if either of
them had been destroyed, there would have been no generation of living
beings); and when he observed that the good of the soul was ever by
nature designed to profit men, and the evil to harm them--he, seeing all
this, contrived so to place each of the parts that their position might
in the easiest and best manner procure the victory of good and the
defeat of evil in the whole. and he contrived a general plan by which
a thing of a certain nature found a certain seat and room. but the
formation of qualities he left to the wills of individuals. for every
one of us is made pretty much what he is by the bent of his desires and
the nature of his soul.

cleinias: yes, that is probably true.

athenian: then all things which have a soul change, and possess in
themselves a principle of change, and in changing move according to
law and to the order of destiny: natures which have undergone a lesser
change move less and on the earth's surface, but those which have
suffered more change and have become more criminal sink into the abyss,
that is to say, into hades and other places in the world below, of which
the very names terrify men, and which they picture to themselves as in
a dream, both while alive and when released from the body. and whenever
the soul receives more of good or evil from her own energy and the
strong influence of others--when she has communion with divine virtue
and becomes divine, she is carried into another and better place, which
is perfect in holiness; but when she has communion with evil, then she
also changes the place of her life.

'this is the justice of the gods who inhabit olympus.'

o youth or young man, who fancy that you are neglected by the gods, know
that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls, or if better
to the better, and in every succession of life and death you will do
and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of like. this is the
justice of heaven, which neither you nor any other unfortunate will
ever glory in escaping, and which the ordaining powers have specially
ordained; take good heed thereof, for it will be sure to take heed of
you. if you say: i am small and will creep into the depths of the earth,
or i am high and will fly up to heaven, you are not so small or so high
but that you shall pay the fitting penalty, either here or in the world
below or in some still more savage place whither you shall be conveyed.
this is also the explanation of the fate of those whom you saw, who had
done unholy and evil deeds, and from small beginnings had grown great,
and you fancied that from being miserable they had become happy; and in
their actions, as in a mirror, you seemed to see the universal neglect
of the gods, not knowing how they make all things work together and
contribute to the great whole. and thinkest thou, bold man, that thou
needest not to know this? he who knows it not can never form any true
idea of the happiness or unhappiness of life or hold any rational
discourse respecting either. if cleinias and this our reverend company
succeed in proving to you that you know not what you say of the gods,
then will god help you; but should you desire to hear more, listen
to what we say to the third opponent, if you have any understanding
whatsoever. for i think that we have sufficiently proved the existence
of the gods, and that they care for men: the other notion that they are
appeased by the wicked, and take gifts, is what we must not concede to
any one, and what every man should disprove to the utmost of his power.

cleinias: very good; let us do as you say.

athenian: well, then, by the gods themselves i conjure you to tell
me--if they are to be propitiated, how are they to be propitiated? who
are they, and what is their nature? must they not be at least rulers who
have to order unceasingly the whole heaven?

cleinias: true.

athenian: and to what earthly rulers can they be compared, or who to
them? how in the less can we find an image of the greater? are they
charioteers of contending pairs of steeds, or pilots of vessels? perhaps
they might be compared to the generals of armies, or they might be
likened to physicians providing against the diseases which make war
upon the body, or to husbandmen observing anxiously the effects of the
seasons on the growth of plants; or perhaps to shepherds of flocks. for
as we acknowledge the world to be full of many goods and also of evils,
and of more evils than goods, there is, as we affirm, an immortal
conflict going on among us, which requires marvellous watchfulness; and
in that conflict the gods and demigods are our allies, and we are their
property. injustice and insolence and folly are the destruction of us,
and justice and temperance and wisdom are our salvation; and the place
of these latter is in the life of the gods, although some vestige of
them may occasionally be discerned among mankind. but upon this earth
we know that there dwell souls possessing an unjust spirit, who may be
compared to brute animals, which fawn upon their keepers, whether dogs
or shepherds, or the best and most perfect masters; for they in like
manner, as the voices of the wicked declare, prevail by flattery and
prayers and incantations, and are allowed to make their gains with
impunity. and this sin, which is termed dishonesty, is an evil of the
same kind as what is termed disease in living bodies or pestilence in
years or seasons of the year, and in cities and governments has another
name, which is injustice.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: what else can he say who declares that the gods are always
lenient to the doers of unjust acts, if they divide the spoil with them?
as if wolves were to toss a portion of their prey to the dogs, and they,
mollified by the gift, suffered them to tear the flocks. must not he who
maintains that the gods can be propitiated argue thus?

cleinias: precisely so.

athenian: and to which of the above-mentioned classes of guardians would
any man compare the gods without absurdity? will he say that they
are like pilots, who are themselves turned away from their duty by
'libations of wine and the savour of fat,' and at last overturn both
ship and sailors?

cleinias: assuredly not.

athenian: and surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed to
give up the victory to other chariots?

cleinias: that would be a fearful image of the gods.

athenian: nor are they like generals, or physicians, or husbandmen, or
shepherds; and no one would compare them to dogs who have been silenced
by wolves.

cleinias: a thing not to be spoken of.

athenian: and are not all the gods the chiefest of all guardians, and do
they not guard our highest interests?

cleinias: yes; the chiefest.

athenian: and shall we say that those who guard our noblest interests,
and are the best of guardians, are inferior in virtue to dogs, and to
men even of moderate excellence, who would never betray justice for the
sake of gifts which unjust men impiously offer them?

cleinias: certainly not; nor is such a notion to be endured, and he who
holds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized as of all
impious men the wickedest and most impious.

athenian: then are the three assertions--that the gods exist, and
that they take care of men, and that they can never be persuaded to do
injustice, now sufficiently demonstrated? may we say that they are?

cleinias: you have our entire assent to your words.

athenian: i have spoken with vehemence because i am zealous against evil
men; and i will tell you, dear cleinias, why i am so. i would not have
the wicked think that, having the superiority in argument, they may do
as they please and act according to their various imaginations about the
gods; and this zeal has led me to speak too vehemently; but if we have
at all succeeded in persuading the men to hate themselves and love their
opposites, the prelude of our laws about impiety will not have been
spoken in vain.

cleinias: so let us hope; and even if we have failed, the style of our
argument will not discredit the lawgiver.

athenian: after the prelude shall follow a discourse, which will be the
interpreter of the law; this shall proclaim to all impious persons that
they must depart from their ways and go over to the pious. and to those
who disobey, let the law about impiety be as follows: if a man is guilty
of any impiety in word or deed, any one who happens to be present shall
give information to the magistrates, in aid of the law; and let the
magistrates who first receive the information bring him before the
appointed court according to the law; and if a magistrate, after
receiving information, refuses to act, he shall be tried for impiety at
the instance of any one who is willing to vindicate the laws; and if
any one be cast, the court shall estimate the punishment of each act of
impiety; and let all such criminals be imprisoned. there shall be three
prisons in the state: the first of them is to be the common prison in
the neighbourhood of the agora for the safe-keeping of the generality
of offenders; another is to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal
council, and is to be called the 'house of reformation'; another, to be
situated in some wild and desolate region in the centre of the country,
shall be called by some name expressive of retribution. now, men fall
into impiety from three causes, which have been already mentioned, and
from each of these causes arise two sorts of impiety, in all six, which
are worth distinguishing, and should not all have the same punishment.
for he who does not believe in the gods, and yet has a righteous nature,
hates the wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice, and avoids
unrighteous men, and loves the righteous. but they who besides believing
that the world is devoid of gods are intemperate, and have at the same
time good memories and quick wits, are worse; although both of them are
unbelievers, much less injury is done by the one than by the other. the
one may talk loosely about the gods and about sacrifices and oaths, and
perhaps by laughing at other men he may make them like himself, if he be
not punished. but the other who holds the same opinions and is called a
clever man, is full of stratagem and deceit--men of this class deal in
prophecy and jugglery of all kinds, and out of their ranks sometimes
come tyrants and demagogues and generals and hierophants of private
mysteries and the sophists, as they are termed, with their ingenious
devices. there are many kinds of unbelievers, but two only for whom
legislation is required; one the hypocritical sort, whose crime is
deserving of death many times over, while the other needs only bonds and
admonition. in like manner also the notion that the gods take no thought
of men produces two other sorts of crimes, and the notion that they may
be propitiated produces two more. assuming these divisions, let those
who have been made what they are only from want of understanding, and
not from malice or an evil nature, be placed by the judge in the house
of reformation, and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period
of not less than five years. and in the meantime let them have no
intercourse with the other citizens, except with members of the
nocturnal council, and with them let them converse with a view to
the improvement of their soul's health. and when the time of their
imprisonment has expired, if any of them be of sound mind let him be
restored to sane company, but if not, and if he be condemned a second
time, let him be punished with death. as to that class of monstrous
natures who not only believe that there are no gods, or that they are
negligent, or to be propitiated, but in contempt of mankind conjure the
souls of the living and say that they can conjure the dead and promise
to charm the gods with sacrifices and prayers, and will utterly
overthrow individuals and whole houses and states for the sake of
money--let him who is guilty of any of these things be condemned by the
court to be bound according to law in the prison which is in the centre
of the land, and let no freeman ever approach him, but let him receive
the rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from the hands
of the public slaves; and when he is dead let him be cast beyond the
borders unburied, and if any freeman assist in burying him, let him pay
the penalty of impiety to any one who is willing to bring a suit against
him. but if he leaves behind him children who are fit to be citizens,
let the guardians of orphans take care of them, just as they would of
any other orphans, from the day on which their father is convicted.

in all these cases there should be one law, which will make men in
general less liable to transgress in word or deed, and less foolish,
because they will not be allowed to practise religious rites contrary
to law. and let this be the simple form of the law: no man shall have
sacred rites in a private house. when he would sacrifice, let him go to
the temples and hand over his offerings to the priests and priestesses,
who see to the sanctity of such things, and let him pray himself, and
let any one who pleases join with him in prayer. the reason of this is
as follows: gods and temples are not easily instituted, and to establish
them rightly is the work of a mighty intellect. and women especially,
and men too, when they are sick or in danger, or in any sort of
difficulty, or again on their receiving any good fortune, have a way of
consecrating the occasion, vowing sacrifices, and promising shrines to
gods, demigods, and sons of gods; and when they are awakened by terrible
apparitions and dreams or remember visions, they find in altars and
temples the remedies of them, and will fill every house and village with
them, placing them in the open air, or wherever they may have had such
visions; and with a view to all these cases we should obey the law. the
law has also regard to the impious, and would not have them fancy that
by the secret performance of these actions--by raising temples and by
building altars in private houses, they can propitiate the god secretly
with sacrifices and prayers, while they are really multiplying their
crimes infinitely, bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves, and also
upon those who permit them, and who are better men than they are;
and the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of their
impiety, which, in a certain sense, is deserved. assuredly god will not
blame the legislator, who will enact the following law: no one shall
possess shrines of the gods in private houses, and he who is found
to possess them, and perform any sacred rites not publicly
authorised--supposing the offender to be some man or woman who is not
guilty of any other great and impious crime--shall be informed against
by him who is acquainted with the fact, which shall be announced by him
to the guardians of the law; and let them issue orders that he or she
shall carry away their private rites to the public temples, and if they
do not persuade them, let them inflict a penalty on them until they
comply. and if a person be proven guilty of impiety, not merely from
childish levity, but such as grown-up men may be guilty of, whether he
have sacrificed publicly or privately to any gods, let him be punished
with death, for his sacrifice is impure. whether the deed has been done
in earnest, or only from childish levity, let the guardians of the law
determine, before they bring the matter into court and prosecute the
offender for impiety.




book xi.

in the next place, dealings between man and man require to be suitably
regulated. the principle of them is very simple: thou shalt not, if thou
canst help, touch that which is mine, or remove the least thing which
belongs to me without my consent; and may i be of a sound mind, and do
to others as i would that they should do to me. first, let us speak of
treasure-trove: may i never pray the gods to find the hidden treasure,
which another has laid up for himself and his family, he not being one
of my ancestors, nor lift, if i should find, such a treasure. and may i
never have any dealings with those who are called diviners, and who in
any way or manner counsel me to take up the deposit entrusted to the
earth, for i should not gain so much in the increase of my possessions,
if i take up the prize, as i should grow in justice and virtue of soul,
if i abstain; and this will be a better possession to me than the other
in a better part of myself; for the possession of justice in the soul
is preferable to the possession of wealth. and of many things it is
well said--'move not the immovables,' and this may be regarded as one of
them. and we shall do well to believe the common tradition which says,
that such deeds prevent a man from having a family. now as to him who is
careless about having children and regardless of the legislator, taking
up that which neither he deposited, nor any ancestor of his, without
the consent of the depositor, violating the simplest and noblest of laws
which was the enactment of no mean man: 'take not up that which was not
laid down by thee'--of him, i say, who despises these two legislators,
and takes up, not some small matter which he has not deposited, but
perhaps a great heap of treasure, what he ought to suffer at the hands
of the gods, god only knows; but i would have the first person who sees
him go and tell the wardens of the city, if the occurrence has taken
place in the city, or if the occurrence has taken place in the agora he
shall tell the wardens of the agora, or if in the country he shall tell
the wardens of the country and their commanders. when information has
been received the city shall send to delphi, and, whatever the god
answers about the money and the remover of the money, that the city
shall do in obedience to the oracle; the informer, if he be a freeman,
shall have the honour of doing rightly, and he who informs not, the
dishonour of doing wrongly; and if he be a slave who gives information,
let him be freed, as he ought to be, by the state, which shall give his
master the price of him; but if he do not inform he shall be punished
with death. next in order shall follow a similar law, which shall apply
equally to matters great and small: if a man happens to leave behind him
some part of his property, whether intentionally or unintentionally, let
him who may come upon the left property suffer it to remain, reflecting
that such things are under the protection of the goddess of ways, and
are dedicated to her by the law. but if any one defies the law, and
takes the property home with him, let him, if the thing is of little
worth, and the man who takes it a slave, be beaten with many stripes by
him who meets him, being a person of not less than thirty years of age.
or if he be a freeman, in addition to being thought a mean person and
a despiser of the laws, let him pay ten times the value of the treasure
which he has moved to the leaver. and if some one accuses another of
having anything which belongs to him, whether little or much, and the
other admits that he has this thing, but denies that the property in
dispute belongs to the other, if the property be registered with the
magistrates according to law, the claimant shall summon the possessor,
who shall bring it before the magistrates; and when it is brought into
court, if it be registered in the public registers, to which of the
litigants it belonged, let him take it and go his way. or if the
property be registered as belonging to some one who is not present,
whoever will offer sufficient surety on behalf of the absent person that
he will give it up to him, shall take it away as the representative of
the other. but if the property which is deposited be not registered with
the magistrates, let it remain until the time of trial with three of the
eldest of the magistrates; and if it be an animal which is deposited,
then he who loses the suit shall pay the magistrates for its keep, and
they shall determine the cause within three days.

any one who is of sound mind may arrest his own slave, and do with him
whatever he will of such things as are lawful; and he may arrest the
runaway slave of any of his friends or kindred with a view to his
safe-keeping. and if any one takes away him who is being carried off as
a slave, intending to liberate him, he who is carrying him off shall let
him go; but he who takes him away shall give three sufficient sureties;
and if he give them, and not without giving them, he may take him away,
but if he take him away after any other manner he shall be deemed guilty
of violence, and being convicted shall pay as a penalty double the
amount of the damages claimed to him who has been deprived of the slave.
any man may also carry off a freedman, if he do not pay respect or
sufficient respect to him who freed him. now the respect shall be, that
the freedman go three times in the month to the hearth of the person who
freed him, and offer to do whatever he ought, so far as he can; and he
shall agree to make such a marriage as his former master approves.
he shall not be permitted to have more property than he who gave him
liberty, and what more he has shall belong to his master. the freedman
shall not remain in the state more than twenty years, but like other
foreigners shall go away, taking his entire property with him, unless he
has the consent of the magistrates and of his former master to remain.
if a freedman or any other stranger has a property greater than the
census of the third class, at the expiration of thirty days from the day
on which this comes to pass, he shall take that which is his and go his
way, and in this case he shall not be allowed to remain any longer by
the magistrates. and if any one disobeys this regulation, and is brought
into court and convicted, he shall be punished with death, and his
property shall be confiscated. suits about these matters shall take
place before the tribes, unless the plaintiff and defendant have got rid
of the accusation either before their neighbours or before judges chosen
by them. if a man lay claim to any animal or anything else which he
declares to be his, let the possessor refer to the seller or to some
honest and trustworthy person, who has given, or in some legitimate way
made over the property to him; if he be a citizen or a metic, sojourning
in the city, within thirty days, or, if the property have been delivered
to him by a stranger, within five months, of which the middle month
shall include the summer solstice. when goods are exchanged by selling
and buying, a man shall deliver them, and receive the price of them, at
a fixed place in the agora, and have done with the matter; but he shall
not buy or sell anywhere else, nor give credit. and if in any other
manner or in any other place there be an exchange of one thing for
another, and the seller give credit to the man who buys from him, he
must do this on the understanding that the law gives no protection in
cases of things sold not in accordance with these regulations. again,
as to contributions, any man who likes may go about collecting
contributions as a friend among friends, but if any difference arises
about the collection, he is to act on the understanding that the law
gives no protection in such cases. he who sells anything above the value
of fifty drachmas shall be required to remain in the city for ten days,
and the purchaser shall be informed of the house of the seller, with a
view to the sort of charges which are apt to arise in such cases, and
the restitutions which the law allows. and let legal restitution be on
this wise: if a man sells a slave who is in a consumption, or who has
the disease of the stone, or of strangury, or epilepsy, or some other
tedious and incurable disorder of body or mind, which is not discernible
to the ordinary man, if the purchaser be a physician or trainer, he
shall have no right of restitution; nor shall there be any right of
restitution if the seller has told the truth beforehand to the buyer.
but if a skilled person sells to another who is not skilled, let the
buyer appeal for restitution within six months, except in the case of
epilepsy, and then the appeal may be made within a year. the cause shall
be determined by such physicians as the parties may agree to choose; and
the defendant, if he lose the suit, shall pay double the price at which
he sold. if a private person sell to another private person, he shall
have the right of restitution, and the decision shall be given as
before, but the defendant, if he be cast, shall only pay back the price
of the slave. if a person sells a homicide to another, and they both
know of the fact, let there be no restitution in such a case, but if he
do not know of the fact, there shall be a right of restitution, whenever
the buyer makes the discovery; and the decision shall rest with the five
youngest guardians of the law, and if the decision be that the seller
was cognisant of the fact, he shall purify the house of the purchaser,
according to the law of the interpreters, and shall pay back three times
the purchase-money.

if a man exchanges either money for money, or anything whatever for
anything else, either with or without life, let him give and receive
them genuine and unadulterated, in accordance with the law. and let us
have a prelude about all this sort of roguery, like the preludes of our
other laws. every man should regard adulteration as of one and the same
class with falsehood and deceit, concerning which the many are too fond
of saying that at proper times and places the practice may often
be right. but they leave the occasion, and the when, and the where,
undefined and unsettled, and from this want of definiteness in their
language they do a great deal of harm to themselves and to others. now
a legislator ought not to leave the matter undetermined; he ought to
prescribe some limit, either greater or less. let this be the rule
prescribed: no one shall call the gods to witness, when he says or does
anything false or deceitful or dishonest, unless he would be the most
hateful of mankind to them. and he is most hateful to them who takes a
false oath, and pays no heed to the gods; and in the next degree, he who
tells a falsehood in the presence of his superiors. now better men are
the superiors of worse men, and in general elders are the superiors of
the young; wherefore also parents are the superiors of their offspring,
and men of women and children, and rulers of their subjects; for all
men ought to reverence any one who is in any position of authority, and
especially those who are in state offices. and this is the reason why
i have spoken of these matters. for every one who is guilty of
adulteration in the agora tells a falsehood, and deceives, and when he
invokes the gods, according to the customs and cautions of the wardens
of the agora, he does but swear without any respect for god or man.
certainly, it is an excellent rule not lightly to defile the names of
the gods, after the fashion of men in general, who care little about
piety and purity in their religious actions. but if a man will not
conform to this rule, let the law be as follows: he who sells anything
in the agora shall not ask two prices for that which he sells, but he
shall ask one price, and if he do not obtain this, he shall take away
his goods; and on that day he shall not value them either at more or
less; and there shall be no praising of any goods, or oath taken about
them. if a person disobeys this command, any citizen who is present, not
being less than thirty years of age, may with impunity chastise and beat
the swearer, but if instead of obeying the laws he takes no heed, he
shall be liable to the charge of having betrayed them. if a man sells
any adulterated goods and will not obey these regulations, he who
knows and can prove the fact, and does prove it in the presence of the
magistrates, if he be a slave or a metic, shall have the adulterated
goods; but if he be a citizen, and do not pursue the charge, he shall be
called a rogue, and deemed to have robbed the gods of the agora; or if
he proves the charge, he shall dedicate the goods to the gods of the
agora. he who is proved to have sold any adulterated goods, in addition
to losing the goods themselves, shall be beaten with stripes--a stripe
for a drachma, according to the price of the goods; and the herald shall
proclaim in the agora the offence for which he is going to be beaten.
the wardens of the agora and the guardians of the law shall obtain
information from experienced persons about the rogueries and
adulterations of the sellers, and shall write up what the seller ought
and ought not to do in each case; and let them inscribe their laws on a
column in front of the court of the wardens of the agora, that they may
be clear instructors of those who have business in the agora. enough
has been said in what has preceded about the wardens of the city, and if
anything seems to be wanting, let them communicate with the guardians of
the law, and write down the omission, and place on a column in the court
of the wardens of the city the primary and secondary regulations which
are laid down for them about their office.

after the practices of adulteration naturally follow the practices of
retail trade. concerning these, we will first of all give a word of
counsel and reason, and the law shall come afterwards. retail trade in
a city is not by nature intended to do any harm, but quite the
contrary; for is not he a benefactor who reduces the inequalities and
incommensurabilities of goods to equality and common measure? and this
is what the power of money accomplishes, and the merchant may be said to
be appointed for this purpose. the hireling and the tavern-keeper, and
many other occupations, some of them more and others less seemly--all
alike have this object--they seek to satisfy our needs and equalize our
possessions. let us then endeavour to see what has brought retail trade
into ill-odour, and wherein lies the dishonour and unseemliness of it,
in order that if not entirely, we may yet partially, cure the evil by
legislation. to effect this is no easy matter, and requires a great deal
of virtue.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: dear cleinias, the class of men is small--they must have been
rarely gifted by nature, and trained by education--who, when assailed by
wants and desires, are able to hold out and observe moderation, and when
they might make a great deal of money are sober in their wishes, and
prefer a moderate to a large gain. but the mass of mankind are the
very opposite: their desires are unbounded, and when they might gain in
moderation they prefer gains without limit; wherefore all that relates
to retail trade, and merchandise, and the keeping of taverns, is
denounced and numbered among dishonourable things. for if what i trust
may never be and will not be, we were to compel, if i may venture to say
a ridiculous thing, the best men everywhere to keep taverns for a
time, or carry on retail trade, or do anything of that sort; or if, in
consequence of some fate or necessity, the best women were compelled to
follow similar callings, then we should know how agreeable and pleasant
all these things are; and if all such occupations were managed on
incorrupt principles, they would be honoured as we honour a mother or a
nurse. but now that a man goes to desert places and builds houses which
can only be reached by long journeys, for the sake of retail trade, and
receives strangers who are in need at the welcome resting-place, and
gives them peace and calm when they are tossed by the storm, or cool
shade in the heat; and then instead of behaving to them as friends, and
showing the duties of hospitality to his guests, treats them as enemies
and captives who are at his mercy, and will not release them until they
have paid the most unjust, abominable, and extortionate ransom--these
are the sort of practises, and foul evils they are, which cast a
reproach upon the succour of adversity. and the legislator ought always
to be devising a remedy for evils of this nature. there is an ancient
saying, which is also a true one--'to fight against two opponents is a
difficult thing,' as is seen in diseases and in many other cases. and in
this case also the war is against two enemies--wealth and poverty; one
of whom corrupts the soul of man with luxury, while the other drives him
by pain into utter shamelessness. what remedy can a city of sense find
against this disease? in the first place, they must have as few retail
traders as possible; and in the second place, they must assign the
occupation to that class of men whose corruption will be the least
injury to the state; and in the third place, they must devise some way
whereby the followers of these occupations themselves will not readily
fall into habits of unbridled shamelessness and meanness.

after this preface let our law run as follows, and may fortune favour
us: no landowner among the magnetes, whose city the god is restoring and
resettling--no one, that is, of the 5040 families, shall become a
retail trader either voluntarily or involuntarily; neither shall he be
a merchant, or do any service for private persons unless they equally
serve him, except for his father or his mother, and their fathers and
mothers; and in general for his elders who are freemen, and whom he
serves as a freeman. now it is difficult to determine accurately the
things which are worthy or unworthy of a freeman, but let those who have
obtained the prize of virtue give judgment about them in accordance
with their feelings of right and wrong. he who in any way shares in the
illiberality of retail trades may be indicted for dishonouring his race
by any one who likes, before those who have been judged to be the first
in virtue; and if he appear to throw dirt upon his father's house by an
unworthy occupation, let him be imprisoned for a year and abstain from
that sort of thing; and if he repeat the offence, for two years; and
every time that he is convicted let the length of his imprisonment be
doubled. this shall be the second law: he who engages in retail trade
must be either a metic or a stranger. and a third law shall be: in
order that the retail trader who dwells in our city may be as good or
as little bad as possible, the guardians of the law shall remember
that they are not only guardians of those who may be easily watched and
prevented from becoming lawless or bad, because they are well-born and
bred; but still more should they have a watch over those who are of
another sort, and follow pursuits which have a very strong tendency to
make men bad. and, therefore, in respect of the multifarious occupations
of retail trade, that is to say, in respect of such of them as are
allowed to remain, because they seem to be quite necessary in a
state--about these the guardians of the law should meet and take counsel
with those who have experience of the several kinds of retail trade, as
we before commanded concerning adulteration (which is a matter akin to
this), and when they meet they shall consider what amount of receipts,
after deducting expenses, will produce a moderate gain to the retail
trades, and they shall fix in writing and strictly maintain what they
find to be the right percentage of profit; this shall be seen to by the
wardens of the agora, and by the wardens of the city, and by the wardens
of the country. and so retail trade will benefit every one, and do the
least possible injury to those in the state who practise it.

when a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil, unless the
agreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assembly does
not allow, or which he has made under the influence of some unjust
compulsion, or which he is prevented from fulfilling against his will
by some unexpected chance, the other party may go to law with him in
the courts of the tribes, for not having completed his agreement, if
the parties are not able previously to come to terms before arbiters or
before their neighbours. the class of craftsmen who have furnished human
life with the arts is dedicated to hephaestus and athene; and there is
a class of craftsmen who preserve the works of all craftsmen by arts of
defence, the votaries of ares and athene, to which divinities they
too are rightly dedicated. all these continue through life serving the
country and the people; some of them are leaders in battle; others make
for hire implements and works, and they ought not to deceive in such
matters, out of respect to the gods who are their ancestors. if any
craftsman through indolence omit to execute his work in a given
time, not reverencing the god who gives him the means of life, but
considering, foolish fellow, that he is his own god and will let him off
easily, in the first place, he shall suffer at the hands of the god, and
in the second place, the law shall follow in a similar spirit. he shall
owe to him who contracted with him the price of the works which he has
failed in performing, and he shall begin again and execute them gratis
in the given time. when a man undertakes a work, the law gives him the
same advice which was given to the seller, that he should not attempt to
raise the price, but simply ask the value; this the law enjoins also on
the contractor; for the craftsman assuredly knows the value of his work.
wherefore, in free states the man of art ought not to attempt to impose
upon private individuals by the help of his art, which is by nature a
true thing; and he who is wronged in a matter of this sort, shall have
a right of action against the party who has wronged him. and if any one
lets out work to a craftsman, and does not pay him duly according to the
lawful agreement, disregarding zeus the guardian of the city and athene,
who are the partners of the state, and overthrows the foundations of
society for the sake of a little gain, in his case let the law and the
gods maintain the common bonds of the state. and let him who, having
already received the work in exchange, does not pay the price in the
time agreed, pay double the price; and if a year has elapsed, although
interest is not to be taken on loans, yet for every drachma which he
owes to the contractor let him pay a monthly interest of an obol. suits
about these matters are to be decided by the courts of the tribes; and
by the way, since we have mentioned craftsmen at all, we must not
forget that other craft of war, in which generals and tacticians are the
craftsmen, who undertake voluntarily or involuntarily the work of our
safety, as other craftsmen undertake other public works--if they execute
their work well the law will never tire of praising him who gives them
those honours which are the just rewards of the soldier; but if any one,
having already received the benefit of any noble service in war, does
not make the due return of honour, the law will blame him. let this then
be the law, having an ingredient of praise, not compelling but advising
the great body of the citizens to honour the brave men who are the
saviours of the whole state, whether by their courage or by their
military skill--they should honour them, i say, in the second place; for
the first and highest tribute of respect is to be given to those who are
able above other men to honour the words of good legislators.

the greater part of the dealings between man and man have been now
regulated by us with the exception of those that relate to orphans and
the supervision of orphans by their guardians. these follow next in
order, and must be regulated in some way. but to arrive at them we must
begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case of those
who may have happened to die intestate. when i said, cleinias, that we
must regulate them, i had in my mind the difficulty and perplexity in
which all such matters are involved. you cannot leave them unregulated,
for individuals would make regulations at variance with one another, and
repugnant to the laws and habits of the living and to their own previous
habits, if a person were simply allowed to make any will which he
pleased, and this were to take effect in whatever state he may have been
at the end of his life; for most of us lose our senses in a manner, and
feel crushed when we think that we are about to die.

cleinias: what do you mean, stranger?

athenian: o cleinias, a man when he is about to die is an intractable
creature, and is apt to use language which causes a great deal of
anxiety and trouble to the legislator.

cleinias: in what way?

athenian: he wants to have the entire control of all his property, and
will use angry words.

cleinias: such as what?

athenian: o ye gods, he will say, how monstrous that i am not allowed
to give, or not to give, my own to whom i will--less to him who has been
bad to me, and more to him who has been good to me, and whose badness
and goodness have been tested by me in time of sickness or in old age
and in every other sort of fortune!

cleinias: well, stranger, and may he not very fairly say so?

athenian: in my opinion, cleinias, the ancient legislators were
too good-natured, and made laws without sufficient observation or
consideration of human things.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: i mean, my friend, that they were afraid of the testator's
reproaches, and so they passed a law to the effect that a man should be
allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked; but you
and i, if i am not mistaken, will have something better to say to our
departing citizens.

cleinias: what?

athenian: o my friends, we will say to them, hard is it for you, who
are creatures of a day, to know what is yours--hard too, as the delphic
oracle says, to know yourselves at this hour. now i, as the legislator,
regard you and your possessions, not as belonging to yourselves, but as
belonging to your whole family, both past and future, and yet more do i
regard both family and possessions as belonging to the state; wherefore,
if some one steals upon you with flattery, when you are tossed on the
sea of disease or old age, and persuades you to dispose of your property
in a way that is not for the best, i will not, if i can help, allow
this; but i will legislate with a view to the whole, considering what
is best both for the state and for the family, esteeming as i ought
the feelings of an individual at a lower rate; and i hope that you will
depart in peace and kindness towards us, as you are going the way of
all mankind; and we will impartially take care of all your concerns, not
neglecting any of them, if we can possibly help. let this be our prelude
and consolation to the living and dying, cleinias, and let the law be as
follows: he who makes a disposition in a testament, if he be the father
of a family, shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of his sons
whom he may think fit; and if he gives any of his children to be adopted
by another citizen, let the adoption be inscribed. and if he has a son
remaining over and above who has not been adopted upon any lot, and who
may be expected to be sent out to a colony according to law, to him his
father may give as much as he pleases of the rest of his property, with
the exception of the paternal lot and the fixtures on the lot. and if
there are other sons, let him distribute among them what there is more
than the lot in such portions as he pleases. and if one of the sons
has already a house of his own, he shall not give him of the money, nor
shall he give money to a daughter who has been betrothed, but if she is
not betrothed he may give her money. and if any of the sons or daughters
shall be found to have another lot of land in the country, which has
accrued after the testament has been made, they shall leave the lot
which they have inherited to the heir of the man who has made the will.
if the testator has no sons, but only daughters, let him choose the
husband of any one of his daughters whom he pleases, and leave and
inscribe him as his son and heir. and if a man have lost his son, when
he was a child, and before he could be reckoned among grown up men,
whether his own or an adopted son, let the testator make mention of the
circumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second son in hope of
better fortune. if the testator has no children at all, he may select
and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of the property which
he has acquired; but let him not be blamed if he gives all the rest to
his adopted son, and makes a friend of him according to the law. if the
sons of a man require guardians, and the father when he dies leaves a
will appointing guardians, those who have been named by him, whoever
they are and whatever their number be, if they are able and willing
to take charge of the children, shall be recognised according to the
provisions of the will. but if he dies and has made no will, or a will
in which he has appointed no guardians, then the next of kin, two on
the father's and two on the mother's side, and one of the friends of the
deceased, shall have the authority of guardians, whom the guardians
of the law shall appoint when the orphans require guardians. and the
fifteen eldest guardians of the law shall have the whole care and charge
of the orphans, divided into threes according to seniority--a body of
three for one year, and then another body of three for the next year,
until the cycle of the five periods is complete; and this, as far as
possible, is to continue always. if a man dies, having made no will at
all, and leaves sons who require the care of guardians, they shall share
in the protection which is afforded by these laws. and if a man dying
by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behind him, let him pardon the
legislator if when he gives them in marriage, he have a regard only to
two out of three conditions--nearness of kin and the preservation of
the lot, and omits the third condition, which a father would naturally
consider, for he would choose out of all the citizens a son for himself,
and a husband for his daughter, with a view to his character and
disposition--the father, i say, shall forgive the legislator if he
disregards this, which to him is an impossible consideration. let the
law about these matters where practicable be as follows: if a man dies
without making a will, and leaves behind him daughters, let his brother,
being the son of the same father or of the same mother, having no lot,
marry the daughter and have the lot of the dead man. and if he have no
brother, but only a brother's son, in like manner let them marry, if
they be of a suitable age; and if there be not even a brother's son,
but only the son of a sister, let them do likewise, and so in the fourth
degree, if there be only the testator's father's brother, or in the
fifth degree, his father's brother's son, or in the sixth degree, the
child of his father's sister. let kindred be always reckoned in this
way: if a person leaves daughters the relationship shall proceed upwards
through brothers and sisters, and brothers' and sisters' children,
and first the males shall come, and after them the females in the same
family. the judge shall consider and determine the suitableness or
unsuitableness of age in marriage; he shall make an inspection of the
males naked, and of the women naked down to the navel. and if there be a
lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of a brother, or
to the grandchildren of a grandfather's children, the maiden may choose
with the consent of her guardians any one of the citizens who is willing
and whom she wills, and he shall be the heir of the dead man, and the
husband of his daughter. circumstances vary, and there may sometimes be
a still greater lack of relations within the limits of the state; and if
any maiden has no kindred living in the city, and there is some one who
has been sent out to a colony, and she is disposed to make him the heir
of her father's possessions, if he be indeed of her kindred, let him
proceed to take the lot according to the regulation of the law; but if
he be not of her kindred, she having no kinsmen within the city, and he
be chosen by the daughter of the dead man, and empowered to marry by
the guardians, let him return home and take the lot of him who died
intestate. and if a man has no children, either male or female, and dies
without making a will, let the previous law in general hold; and let a
man and a woman go forth from the family and share the deserted house,
and let the lot belong absolutely to them; and let the heiress in
the first degree be a sister, and in a second degree a daughter of a
brother, and in the third, a daughter of a sister, in the fourth degree
the sister of a father, and in the fifth degree the daughter of a
father's brother, and in a sixth degree of a father's sister; and
these shall dwell with their male kinsmen, according to the degree of
relationship and right, as we enacted before. now we must not conceal
from ourselves that such laws are apt to be oppressive and that there
may sometimes be a hardship in the lawgiver commanding the kinsman
of the dead man to marry his relation; he may be thought not to have
considered the innumerable hindrances which may arise among men in
the execution of such ordinances; for there may be cases in which the
parties refuse to obey, and are ready to do anything rather than marry,
when there is some bodily or mental malady or defect among those who
are bidden to marry or be married. persons may fancy that the legislator
never thought of this, but they are mistaken; wherefore let us make a
common prelude on behalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects, the law
begging the latter to forgive the legislator, in that he, having to
take care of the common weal, cannot order at the same time the
various circumstances of individuals, and begging him to pardon them if
naturally they are sometimes unable to fulfil the act which he in his
ignorance imposes upon them.

cleinias: and how, stranger, can we act most fairly under the
circumstances?

athenian: there must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws and the
subjects of them.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: i mean to say, that a case may occur in which the nephew,
having a rich father, will be unwilling to marry the daughter of his
uncle; he will have a feeling of pride, and he will wish to look higher.
and there are cases in which the legislator will be imposing upon him
the greatest calamity, and he will be compelled to disobey the law,
if he is required, for example, to take a wife who is mad, or has some
other terrible malady of soul or body, such as makes life intolerable
to the sufferer. then let what we are saying concerning these cases
be embodied in a law: if any one finds fault with the established laws
respecting testaments, both as to other matters and especially in what
relates to marriage, and asserts that the legislator, if he were alive
and present, would not compel him to obey--that is to say, would
not compel those who are by our law required to marry or be given in
marriage, to do either--and some kinsman or guardian dispute this, the
reply is that the legislator left fifteen of the guardians of the law to
be arbiters and fathers of orphans, male or female, and to them let the
disputants have recourse, and by their aid determine any matters of the
kind, admitting their decision to be final. but if any one thinks that
too great power is thus given to the guardians of the law, let him bring
his adversaries into the court of the select judges, and there have
the points in dispute determined. and he who loses the cause shall have
censure and blame from the legislator, which, by a man of sense, is felt
to be a penalty far heavier than a great loss of money.

thus will orphan children have a second birth. after their first birth
we spoke of their nurture and education, and after their second birth,
when they have lost their parents, we ought to take measures that the
misfortune of orphanhood may be as little sad to them as possible. in
the first place, we say that the guardians of the law are lawgivers and
fathers to them, not inferior to their natural fathers. moreover, they
shall take charge of them year by year as of their own kindred; and we
have given both to them and to the children's own guardians as suitable
admonition concerning the nurture of orphans. and we seem to have spoken
opportunely in our former discourse, when we said that the souls of the
dead have the power after death of taking an interest in human affairs,
about which there are many tales and traditions, long indeed, but true;
and seeing that they are so many and so ancient, we must believe them,
and we must also believe the lawgivers, who tell us that these things
are true, if they are not to be regarded as utter fools. but if these
things are really so, in the first place men should have a fear of the
gods above, who regard the loneliness of the orphans; and in the second
place of the souls of the departed, who by nature incline to take an
especial care of their own children, and are friendly to those who
honour, and unfriendly to those who dishonour them. men should also fear
the souls of the living who are aged and high in honour; wherever a city
is well ordered and prosperous, their descendants cherish them, and so
live happily; old persons are quick to see and hear all that relates to
them, and are propitious to those who are just in the fulfilment of such
duties, and they punish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate,
considering that they are the greatest and most sacred of trusts. to all
which matters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind, if
he has any, and take heed of the nurture and education of the orphans,
seeking in every possible way to do them good, for he is making a
contribution to his own good and that of his children. he who obeys the
tale which precedes the law, and does no wrong to an orphan, will never
experience the wrath of the legislator. but he who is disobedient, and
wrongs any one who is bereft of father or mother, shall pay twice the
penalty which he would have paid if he had wronged one whose parents had
been alive. as touching other legislation concerning guardians in their
relation to orphans, or concerning magistrates and their superintendence
of the guardians, if they did not possess examples of the manner in
which children of freemen would be brought up in the bringing up of
their own children, and of the care of their property in the care of
their own, or if they had not just laws fairly stated about these very
things--there would have been reason in making laws for them, under the
idea that they were a peculiar class, and we might distinguish and make
separate rules for the life of those who are orphans and of those who
are not orphans. but as the case stands, the condition of orphans with
us is not different from the case of those who have a father, though in
regard to honour and dishonour, and the attention given to them, the two
are not usually placed upon a level. wherefore, touching the legislation
about orphans, the law speaks in serious accents, both of persuasion and
threatening, and such a threat as the following will be by no means
out of place: he who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex, and
he among the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence of this
guardian has been assigned, shall love the unfortunate orphan as though
he were his own child, and he shall be as careful and diligent in the
management of his possessions as he would be if they were his own, or
even more careful and diligent. let every one who has the care of an
orphan observe this law. but any one who acts contrary to the law on
these matters, if he be a guardian of the child, may be fined by a
magistrate, or, if he be himself a magistrate, the guardian may bring
him before the court of select judges, and punish him, if convicted, by
exacting a fine of double the amount of that inflicted by the court. and
if a guardian appears to the relations of the orphan, or to any other
citizen, to act negligently or dishonestly, let them bring him before
the same court, and whatever damages are given against him, let him pay
fourfold, and let half belong to the orphan and half to him who procured
the conviction. if any orphan arrives at years of discretion, and thinks
that he has been ill-used by his guardians, let him within five years
of the expiration of the guardianship be allowed to bring them to trial;
and if any of them be convicted, the court shall determine what he shall
pay or suffer. and if a magistrate shall appear to have wronged the
orphan by neglect, and he be convicted, let the court determine what
he shall suffer or pay to the orphan, and if there be dishonesty in
addition to neglect, besides paying the fine, let him be deposed from
his office of guardian of the law, and let the state appoint another
guardian of the law for the city and for the country in his room.

greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise between
fathers and sons, on the part either of fathers who will be of opinion
that the legislator should enact that they may, if they wish, lawfully
renounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face of the
world, or of sons who think that they should be allowed to indict their
fathers on the charge of imbecility when they are disabled by disease
or old age. these things only happen, as a matter of fact, where the
natures of men are utterly bad; for where only half is bad, as, for
example, if the father be not bad, but the son be bad, or conversely,
no great calamity is the result of such an amount of hatred as this. in
another state, a son disowned by his father would not of necessity cease
to be a citizen, but in our state, of which these are to be the laws,
the disinherited must necessarily emigrate into another country, for
no addition can be made even of a single family to the 5040 households;
and, therefore, he who deserves to suffer these things must be renounced
not only by his father, who is a single person, but by the whole family,
and what is done in these cases must be regulated by some such law as
the following: he who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind, justly
or unjustly, to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten and
brought up, shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose; but first
of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen, extending to cousins,
and in like manner his son's kinsmen by the mother's side, and in their
presence he shall accuse his son, setting forth that he deserves at the
hands of them all to be dismissed from the family; and the son shall be
allowed to address them in a similar manner, and show that he does not
deserve to suffer any of these things. and if the father persuades them,
and obtains the suffrages of more than half of his kindred, exclusive
of the father and mother and the offender himself--i say, if he obtains
more than half the suffrages of all the other grown-up members of the
family, of both sexes, the father shall be permitted to put away his
son, but not otherwise. and if any other citizen is willing to adopt
the son who is put away, no law shall hinder him; for the characters of
young men are subject to many changes in the course of their lives. and
if he has been put away, and in a period of ten years no one is
willing to adopt him, let those who have the care of the superabundant
population which is sent out into colonies, see to him, in order that
he may be suitably provided for in the colony. and if disease or age or
harshness of temper, or all these together, makes a man to be more out
of his mind than the rest of the world are--but this is not observable,
except to those who live with him--and he, being master of his property,
is the ruin of the house, and his son doubts and hesitates about
indicting his father for insanity, let the law in that case ordain that
he shall first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tell
them of his father's misfortune, and they shall duly look into the
matter, and take counsel as to whether he shall indict him or not. and
if they advise him to proceed, they shall be both his witnesses and his
advocates; and if the father is cast, he shall henceforth be incapable
of ordering the least particular of his life; let him be as a child
dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days. and if a man and
his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of temper, ten of the
guardians of the law, who are impartial, and ten of the women who
regulate marriages, shall look to the matter, and if they are able to
reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled; but if their souls
are too much tossed with passion, they shall endeavour to find other
partners. now they are not likely to have very gentle tempers; and,
therefore, we must endeavour to associate with them deeper and softer
natures. those who have no children, or only a few, at the time of
their separation, should choose their new partners with a view to the
procreation of children; but those who have a sufficient number of
children should separate and marry again in order that they may have
some one to grow old with and that the pair may take care of one another
in age. if a woman dies, leaving children, male or female, the law will
advise rather than compel the husband to bring up the children without
introducing into the house a stepmother. but if he have no children,
then he shall be compelled to marry until he has begotten a sufficient
number of sons to his family and to the state. and if a man dies leaving
a sufficient number of children, the mother of his children shall remain
with them and bring them up. but if she appears to be too young to live
virtuously without a husband, let her relations communicate with the
women who superintend marriage, and let both together do what they think
best in these matters; if there is a lack of children, let the choice be
made with a view to having them; two children, one of either sex, shall
be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law. when a child is admitted
to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged by them,
but there is need of a decision as to which parent the child is to
follow--in case a female slave have intercourse with a male slave, or
with a freeman or freedman, the offspring shall always belong to the
master of the female slave. again, if a free woman have intercourse with
a male slave, the offspring shall belong to the master of the slave; but
if a child be born either of a slave by her master, or of his mistress
by a slave--and this be proven--the offspring of the woman and its
father shall be sent away by the women who superintend marriage into
another country, and the guardians of the law shall send away the
offspring of the man and its mother.

neither god, nor a man who has understanding, will ever advise any
one to neglect his parents. to a discourse concerning the honour and
dishonour of parents, a prelude such as the following, about the service
of the gods, will be a suitable introduction: there are ancient customs
about the gods which are universal, and they are of two kinds: some of
the gods we see with our eyes and we honour them, of others we honour
the images, raising statues of them which we adore; and though they
are lifeless, yet we imagine that the living gods have a good will and
gratitude to us on this account. now, if a man has a father or mother,
or their fathers or mothers treasured up in his house stricken in years,
let him consider that no statue can be more potent to grant his requests
than they are, who are sitting at his hearth, if only he knows how to
show true service to them.

cleinias: and what do you call the true mode of service?

athenian: i will tell you, o my friend, for such things are worth
listening to.

cleinias: proceed.

athenian: oedipus, as tradition says, when dishonoured by his sons,
invoked on them curses which every one declares to have been heard and
ratified by the gods, and amyntor in his wrath invoked curses on his son
phoenix, and theseus upon hippolytus, and innumerable others have also
called down wrath upon their children, whence it is clear that the gods
listen to the imprecations of parents; for the curses of parents are,
as they ought to be, mighty against their children as no others are. and
shall we suppose that the prayers of a father or mother who is specially
dishonoured by his or her children, are heard by the gods in accordance
with nature; and that if a parent is honoured by them, and in the
gladness of his heart earnestly entreats the gods in his prayers to do
them good, he is not equally heard, and that they do not minister to his
request? if not, they would be very unjust ministers of good, and that
we affirm to be contrary to their nature.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: may we not think, as i was saying just now, that we can
possess no image which is more honoured by the gods, than that of a
father or grandfather, or of a mother stricken in years? whom when a man
honours, the heart of the god rejoices, and he is ready to answer their
prayers. and, truly, the figure of an ancestor is a wonderful thing,
far higher than that of a lifeless image. for the living, when they are
honoured by us, join in our prayers, and when they are dishonoured,
they utter imprecations against us; but lifeless objects do neither. and
therefore, if a man makes a right use of his father and grandfather and
other aged relations, he will have images which above all others will
win him the favour of the gods.

cleinias: excellent.

athenian: every man of any understanding fears and respects the prayers
of parents, knowing well that many times and to many persons they have
been accomplished. now these things being thus ordered by nature, good
men think it a blessing from heaven if their parents live to old age and
reach the utmost limit of human life, or if taken away before their time
they are deeply regretted by them; but to bad men parents are always
a cause of terror. wherefore let every man honour with every sort of
lawful honour his own parents, agreeably to what has now been said. but
if this prelude be an unmeaning sound in the ears of any one, let the
law follow, which may be rightly imposed in these terms: if any one in
this city be not sufficiently careful of his parents, and do not regard
and gratify in every respect their wishes more than those of his sons
and of his other offspring or of himself--let him who experiences this
sort of treatment either come himself, or send some one to inform the
three eldest guardians of the law, and three of the women who have the
care of marriages; and let them look to the matter and punish youthful
evil-doers with stripes and bonds if they are under thirty years of age,
that is to say, if they be men, or if they be women, let them undergo
the same punishment up to forty years of age. but if, when they are
still more advanced in years, they continue the same neglect of their
parents, and do any hurt to any of them, let them be brought before
a court in which every single one of the eldest citizens shall be the
judges, and if the offender be convicted, let the court determine what
he ought to pay or suffer, and any penalty may be imposed on him which
a man can pay or suffer. if the person who has been wronged be unable
to inform the magistrates, let any freeman who hears of his case inform,
and if he do not, he shall be deemed base, and shall be liable to have a
suit for damage brought against him by any one who likes. and if a slave
inform, he shall receive freedom; and if he be the slave of the injurer
or injured party, he shall be set free by the magistrates, or if he
belong to any other citizen, the public shall pay a price on his behalf
to the owner; and let the magistrates take heed that no one wrongs him
out of revenge, because he has given information.

cases in which one man injures another by poisons, and which prove
fatal, have been already discussed; but about other cases in which a
person intentionally and of malice harms another with meats, or drinks,
or ointments, nothing has as yet been determined. for there are two
kinds of poisons used among men, which cannot clearly be distinguished.
there is the kind just now explicitly mentioned, which injures bodies
by the use of other bodies according to a natural law; there is also
another kind which persuades the more daring class that they can do
injury by sorceries, and incantations, and magic knots, as they are
termed, and makes others believe that they above all persons are injured
by the powers of the magician. now it is not easy to know the nature of
all these things; nor if a man do know can he readily persuade others to
believe him. and when men are disturbed in their minds at the sight of
waxen images fixed either at their doors, or in a place where three
ways meet, or on the sepulchres of parents, there is no use in trying to
persuade them that they should despise all such things because they have
no certain knowledge about them. but we must have a law in two parts,
concerning poisoning, in whichever of the two ways the attempt is made,
and we must entreat, and exhort, and advise men not to have recourse to
such practises, by which they scare the multitude out of their wits, as
if they were children, compelling the legislator and the judge to heal
the fears which the sorcerer arouses, and to tell them in the first
place, that he who attempts to poison or enchant others knows not what
he is doing, either as regards the body (unless he has a knowledge of
medicine), or as regards his enchantments (unless he happens to be a
prophet or diviner). let the law, then, run as follows about poisoning
or witchcraft: he who employs poison to do any injury, not fatal, to a
man himself, or to his servants, or any injury, whether fatal or not,
to his cattle or his bees, if he be a physician, and be convicted of
poisoning, shall be punished with death; or if he be a private person,
the court shall determine what he is to pay or suffer. but he who
seems to be the sort of man who injures others by magic knots, or
enchantments, or incantations, or any of the like practices, if he be
a prophet or diviner, let him die; and if, not being a prophet, he be
convicted of witchcraft, as in the previous case, let the court fix what
he ought to pay or suffer.

when a man does another any injury by theft or violence, for the greater
injury let him pay greater damages to the injured man, and less for the
smaller injury; but in all cases, whatever the injury may have been, as
much as will compensate the loss. and besides the compensation of the
wrong, let a man pay a further penalty for the chastisement of his
offence: he who has done the wrong instigated by the folly of another,
through the lightheartedness of youth or the like, shall pay a lighter
penalty; but he who has injured another through his own folly, when
overcome by pleasure or pain, in cowardly fear, or lust, or envy, or
implacable anger, shall endure a heavier punishment. not that he is
punished because he did wrong, for that which is done can never be
undone, but in order that in future times, he, and those who see him
corrected, may utterly hate injustice, or at any rate abate much of
their evil-doing. having an eye to all these things, the law, like a
good archer, should aim at the right measure of punishment, and in all
cases at the deserved punishment. in the attainment of this the judge
shall be a fellow-worker with the legislator, whenever the law leaves
to him to determine what the offender shall suffer or pay; and the
legislator, like a painter, shall give a rough sketch of the cases in
which the law is to be applied. this is what we must do, megillus and
cleinias, in the best and fairest manner that we can, saying what the
punishments are to be of all actions of theft and violence, and giving
laws of such a kind as the gods and sons of gods would have us give.

if a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city, but his relations
shall keep him at home in any way which they can; or if not, let them
pay a penalty--he who is of the highest class shall pay a penalty of one
hundred drachmas, whether he be a slave or a freeman whom he neglects;
and he of the second class shall pay four-fifths of a mina; and he of
the third class three-fifths; and he of the fourth class two-fifths. now
there are many sorts of madness, some arising out of disease, which we
have already mentioned; and there are other kinds, which originate in an
evil and passionate temperament, and are increased by bad education;
out of a slight quarrel this class of madmen will often raise a storm of
abuse against one another, and nothing of that sort ought to be allowed
to occur in a well-ordered state. let this, then, be the law about
abuse, which shall relate to all cases: no one shall speak evil of
another; and when a man disputes with another he shall teach and
learn of the disputant and the company, but he shall abstain from
evil-speaking; for out of the imprecations which men utter against one
another, and the feminine habit of casting aspersions on one another,
and using foul names, out of words light as air, in very deed the
greatest enmities and hatreds spring up. for the speaker gratifies his
anger, which is an ungracious element of his nature; and nursing up his
wrath by the entertainment of evil thoughts, and exacerbating that part
of his soul which was formerly civilised by education, he lives in a
state of savageness and moroseness, and pays a bitter penalty for
his anger. and in such cases almost all men take to saying something
ridiculous about their opponent, and there is no man who is in the
habit of laughing at another who does not miss virtue and earnestness
altogether, or lose the better half of greatness. wherefore let no one
utter any taunting word at a temple, or at the public sacrifices, or at
the games, or in the agora, or in a court of justice, or in any public
assembly. and let the magistrate who presides on these occasions
chastise an offender, and he shall be blameless; but if he fails in
doing so, he shall not claim the prize of virtue; for he is one who
heeds not the laws, and does not do what the legislator commands. and if
in any other place any one indulges in these sort of revilings, whether
he has begun the quarrel or is only retaliating, let any elder who is
present support the law, and control with blows those who indulge in
passion, which is another great evil; and if he do not, let him be
liable to pay the appointed penalty. and we say now, that he who deals
in reproaches against others cannot reproach them without attempting to
ridicule them; and this, when done in a moment of anger, is what we make
matter of reproach against him. but then, do we admit into our state
the comic writers who are so fond of making mankind ridiculous, if they
attempt in a good-natured manner to turn the laugh against our citizens?
or do we draw the distinction of jest and earnest, and allow a man
to make use of ridicule in jest and without anger about any thing or
person; though as we were saying, not if he be angry and have a set
purpose? we forbid earnest--that is unalterably fixed; but we have still
to say who are to be sanctioned or not to be sanctioned by the law in
the employment of innocent humour. a comic poet, or maker of iambic or
satirical lyric verse, shall not be permitted to ridicule any of the
citizens, either by word or likeness, either in anger or without anger.
and if any one is disobedient, the judges shall either at once expel him
from the country, or he shall pay a fine of three minae, which shall be
dedicated to the god who presides over the contests. those only who have
received permission shall be allowed to write verses at one another, but
they shall be without anger and in jest; in anger and in serious earnest
they shall not be allowed. the decision of this matter shall be left to
the superintendent of the general education of the young, and whatever
he may license, the writer shall be allowed to produce, and whatever he
rejects let not the poet himself exhibit, or ever teach anybody else,
slave or freeman, under the penalty of being dishonoured, and held
disobedient to the laws.

now he is not to be pitied who is hungry, or who suffers any bodily
pain, but he who is temperate, or has some other virtue, or part of a
virtue, and at the same time suffers from misfortune; it would be an
extraordinary thing if such an one, whether slave or freeman, were
utterly forsaken and fell into the extremes of poverty in any tolerably
well-ordered city or government. wherefore the legislator may safely
make a law applicable to such cases in the following terms: let there
be no beggars in our state; and if anybody begs, seeking to pick up a
livelihood by unavailing prayers, let the wardens of the agora turn him
out of the agora, and the wardens of the city out of the city, and
the wardens of the country send him out of any other parts of the land
across the border, in order that the land may be cleared of this sort of
animal.

if a slave of either sex injure anything, which is not his or her own,
through inexperience, or some improper practice, and the person who
suffers damage be not himself in part to blame, the master of the slave
who has done the harm shall either make full satisfaction, or give up
the slave who has done the injury. but if the master argue that the
charge has arisen by collusion between the injured party and the
injurer, with the view of obtaining the slave, let him sue the person,
who says that he has been injured, for malpractices. and if he gain a
conviction, let him receive double the value which the court fixes as
the price of the slave; and if he lose his suit, let him make amends for
the injury, and give up the slave. and if a beast of burden, or horse,
or dog, or any other animal, injure the property of a neighbour, the
owner shall in like manner pay for the injury.

if any man refuses to be a witness, he who wants him shall summon him,
and he who is summoned shall come to the trial; and if he knows and is
willing to bear witness, let him bear witness, but if he says he does
not know let him swear by the three divinities zeus, and apollo, and
themis, that he does not, and have no more to do with the cause. and
he who is summoned to give witness and does not answer to his summoner,
shall be liable for the harm which ensues according to law. and if a
person calls up as a witness any one who is acting as a judge, let him
give his witness, but he shall not afterwards vote in the cause. a free
woman may give her witness and plead, if she be more than forty years of
age, and may bring an action if she have no husband; but if her husband
be alive she shall only be allowed to bear witness. a slave of either
sex and a child shall be allowed to give evidence and to plead, but only
in cases of murder; and they must produce sufficient sureties that they
will certainly remain until the trial, in case they should be charged
with false witness. and either of the parties in a cause may bring an
accusation of perjury against witnesses, touching their evidence in
whole or in part, if he asserts that such evidence has been given; but
the accusation must be brought previous to the final decision of the
cause. the magistrates shall preserve the accusations of false witness,
and have them kept under the seal of both parties, and produce them on
the day when the trial for false witness takes place. if a man be twice
convicted of false witness, he shall not be required, and if thrice, he
shall not be allowed to bear witness; and if he dare to witness after he
has been convicted three times, let any one who pleases inform against
him to the magistrates, and let the magistrates hand him over to the
court, and if he be convicted he shall be punished with death. and in
any case in which the evidence is rightly found to be false, and yet to
have given the victory to him who wins the suit, and more than half the
witnesses are condemned, the decision which was gained by these means
shall be rescinded, and there shall be a discussion and a decision as
to whether the suit was determined by that false evidence or not; and
in whichever way the decision may be given, the previous suit shall be
determined accordingly.

there are many noble things in human life, but to most of them attach
evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them. is not justice noble,
which has been the civiliser of humanity? how then can the advocate
of justice be other than noble? and yet upon this profession which is
presented to us under the fair name of art has come an evil reputation.
in the first place, we are told that by ingenious pleas and the help
of an advocate the law enables a man to win a particular cause, whether
just or unjust; and that both the art, and the power of speech which is
thereby imparted, are at the service of him who is willing to pay for
them. now in our state this so-called art, whether really an art or only
an experience and practice destitute of any art, ought if possible never
to come into existence, or if existing among us should listen to the
request of the legislator and go away into another land, and not speak
contrary to justice. if the offenders obey we say no more; but for those
who disobey, the voice of the law is as follows: if any one thinks that
he will pervert the power of justice in the minds of the judges, and
unseasonably litigate or advocate, let any one who likes indict him for
malpractices of law and dishonest advocacy, and let him be judged in the
court of select judges; and if he be convicted, let the court determine
whether he may be supposed to act from a love of money or from
contentiousness. and if he is supposed to act from contentiousness, the
court shall fix a time during which he shall not be allowed to institute
or plead a cause; and if he is supposed to act as he does from love of
money, in case he be a stranger, he shall leave the country, and never
return under penalty of death; but if he be a citizen, he shall die,
because he is a lover of money, in whatever manner gained; and equally,
if he be judged to have acted more than once from contentiousness, he
shall die.




book xii.

if a herald or an ambassador carry a false message from our city to any
other, or bring back a false message from the city to which he is sent,
or be proved to have brought back, whether from friends or enemies, in
his capacity of herald or ambassador, what they have never said, let him
be indicted for having violated, contrary to the law, the commands and
duties imposed upon him by hermes and zeus, and let there be a penalty
fixed, which he shall suffer or pay if he be convicted.

theft is a mean, and robbery a shameless thing; and none of the sons of
zeus delight in fraud and violence, or ever practised either. wherefore
let no one be deluded by poets or mythologers into a mistaken belief
of such things, nor let him suppose, when he thieves or is guilty
of violence, that he is doing nothing base, but only what the gods
themselves do. for such tales are untrue and improbable; and he who
steals or robs contrary to the law, is never either a god or the son of
a god; of this the legislator ought to be better informed than all the
poets put together. happy is he and may he be for ever happy, who is
persuaded and listens to our words; but he who disobeys shall have to
contend against the following law: if a man steal anything belonging
to the public, whether that which he steals be much or little, he shall
have the same punishment. for he who steals a little steals with the
same wish as he who steals much, but with less power, and he who
takes up a greater amount, not having deposited it, is wholly unjust.
wherefore the law is not disposed to inflict a less penalty on the one
than on the other because his theft is less, but on the ground that the
thief may possibly be in one case still curable, and may in another case
be incurable. if any one convict in a court of law a stranger or a slave
of a theft of public property, let the court determine what punishment
he shall suffer, or what penalty he shall pay, bearing in mind that he
is probably not incurable. but the citizen who has been brought up
as our citizens will have been, if he be found guilty of robbing his
country by fraud or violence, whether he be caught in the act or not,
shall be punished with death; for he is incurable.

now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws are
required; the great principle of all is that no one of either sex should
be without a commander; nor should the mind of any one be accustomed to
do anything, either in jest or earnest, of his own motion, but in war
and in peace he should look to and follow his leader, even in the least
things being under his guidance; for example, he should stand or move,
or exercise, or wash, or take his meals, or get up in the night to keep
guard and deliver messages when he is bidden; and in the hour of danger
he should not pursue and not retreat except by order of his superior;
and in a word, not teach the soul or accustom her to know or understand
how to do anything apart from others. of all soldiers the life should
be always and in all things as far as possible in common and together;
there neither is nor ever will be a higher, or better, or more
scientific principle than this for the attainment of salvation and
victory in war. and we ought in time of peace from youth upwards to
practise this habit of commanding others, and of being commanded by
others; anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of the beasts
who are subject to man. i may add that all dances ought to be performed
with a view to military excellence; and agility and ease should be
cultivated for the same object, and also endurance of the want of meats
and drinks, and of winter cold and summer heat, and of hard couches;
and, above all, care should be taken not to destroy the peculiar
qualities of the head and the feet by surrounding them with extraneous
coverings, and so hindering their natural growth of hair and soles. for
these are the extremities, and of all the parts of the body, whether
they are preserved or not is of the greatest consequence; the one is
the servant of the whole body, and the other the master, in whom all the
ruling senses are by nature set. let the young men imagine that he hears
in what has preceded the praises of the military life; the law shall
be as follows: he shall serve in war who is on the roll or appointed
to some special service, and if any one is absent from cowardice, and
without the leave of the generals, he shall be indicted before the
military commanders for failure of service when the army comes home; and
the soldiers shall be his judges; the heavy-armed, and the cavalry, and
the other arms of the service shall form separate courts; and they shall
bring the heavy-armed before the heavy-armed, and the horsemen before
the horsemen, and the others in like manner before their peers; and he
who is found guilty shall never be allowed to compete for any prize of
valour, or indict another for not serving on an expedition, or be
an accuser at all in any military matters. moreover, the court shall
further determine what punishment he shall suffer, or what penalty he
shall pay. when the suits for failure of service are completed, the
leaders of the several kinds of troops shall again hold an assembly, and
they shall adjudge the prizes of valour; and he who likes searching
for judgment in his own branch of the service, saying nothing about any
former expedition, nor producing any proof or witnesses to confirm
his statement, but speaking only of the present occasion. the crown of
victory shall be an olive wreath which the victor shall offer up at
the temple of any war-god whom he likes, adding an inscription for a
testimony to last during life, that such an one has received the first,
the second, or the third prize. if any one goes on an expedition, and
returns home before the appointed time, when the generals have not
withdrawn the army, he shall be indicted for desertion before the same
persons who took cognizance of failure of service, and if he be found
guilty, the same punishment shall be inflicted on him. now every man
who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful of bringing false
witness against any one, either intentionally or unintentionally, if
he can help; for justice is truly said to be an honourable maiden, and
falsehood is naturally repugnant to honour and justice. a witness ought
to be very careful not to sin against justice, as for example in what
relates to the throwing away of arms--he must distinguish the throwing
them away when necessary, and not make that a reproach, or bring
an action against some innocent person on that account. to make the
distinction may be difficult; but still the law must attempt to define
the different kinds in some way. let me endeavour to explain my meaning
by an ancient tale: if patroclus had been brought to the tent still
alive but without his arms (and this has happened to innumerable
persons), the original arms, which the poet says were presented to
peleus by the gods as a nuptial gift when he married thetis, remaining
in the hands of hector, then the base spirits of that day might have
reproached the son of menoetius with having cast away his arms. again,
there is the case of those who have been thrown down precipices and lost
their arms; and of those who at sea, and in stormy places, have been
suddenly overwhelmed by floods of water; and there are numberless things
of this kind which one might adduce by way of extenuation, and with the
view of justifying a misfortune which is easily misrepresented. we must,
therefore, endeavour to divide to the best of our power the greater and
more serious evil from the lesser. and a distinction may be drawn in the
use of terms of reproach. a man does not always deserve to be called the
thrower away of his shield; he may be only the loser of his arms.
for there is a great or rather absolute difference between him who is
deprived of his arms by a sufficient force, and him who voluntarily lets
his shield go. let the law then be as follows: if a person having arms
is overtaken by the enemy and does not turn round and defend himself,
but lets them go voluntarily or throws them away, choosing a base
life and a swift escape rather than a courageous and noble and blessed
death--in such a case of the throwing away of arms let justice be done,
but the judge need take no note of the case just now mentioned; for
the bad men ought always to be punished, in the hope that he may be
improved, but not the unfortunate, for there is no advantage in that.
and what shall be the punishment suited to him who has thrown away his
weapons of defence? tradition says that caeneus, the thessalian, was
changed by a god from a woman into a man; but the converse miracle
cannot now be wrought, or no punishment would be more proper than that
the man who throws away his shield should be changed into a woman. this
however is impossible, and therefore let us make a law as nearly like
this as we can--that he who loves his life too well shall be in no
danger for the remainder of his days, but shall live for ever under the
stigma of cowardice. and let the law be in the following terms: when a
man is found guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war, no
general or military officer shall allow him to serve as a soldier, or
give him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers; and the officer
who gives the coward any place, shall suffer a penalty which the public
examiner shall exact of him; and if he be of the highest class, he shall
pay a thousand drachmae; or if he be of the second class, five minae; or
if he be of the third, three minae; or if he be of the fourth class,
one mina. and he who is found guilty of cowardice, shall not only be
dismissed from manly dangers, which is a disgrace appropriate to his
nature, but he shall pay a thousand drachmae, if he be of the highest
class, and five minae if he be of the second class, and three if he
be of the third class, and a mina, like the preceding, if he be of the
fourth class.

what regulations will be proper about examiners, seeing that some of our
magistrates are elected by lot, and for a year, and some for a longer
time and from selected persons? of such magistrates, who will be a
sufficient censor or examiner, if any of them, weighed down by the
pressure of office or his own inability to support the dignity of his
office, be guilty of any crooked practice? it is by no means easy to
find a magistrate who excels other magistrates in virtue, but still we
must endeavour to discover some censor or examiner who is more than
man. for the truth is, that there are many elements of dissolution in a
state, as there are also in a ship, or in an animal; they all have their
cords, and girders, and sinews--one nature diffused in many places, and
called by many names; and the office of examiner is a most important
element in the preservation and dissolution of states. for if the
examiners are better than the magistrates, and their duty is fulfilled
justly and without blame, then the whole state and country flourishes
and is happy; but if the examination of the magistrates is carried on
in a wrong way, then, by the relaxation of that justice which is the
uniting principle of all constitutions, every power in the state is rent
asunder from every other; they no longer incline in the same direction,
but fill the city with faction, and make many cities out of one, and
soon bring all to destruction. wherefore the examiners ought to be
admirable in every sort of virtue. let us invent a mode of creating
them, which shall be as follows: every year, after the summer solstice,
the whole city shall meet in the common precincts of helios and apollo,
and shall present to the god three men out of their own number in the
manner following: each citizen shall select, not himself, but some other
citizen whom he deems in every way the best, and who is not less
than fifty years of age. and out of the selected persons who have the
greatest number of votes, they shall make a further selection until they
reduce them to one-half, if they are an even number; but if they are not
an even number, they shall subtract the one who has the smallest number
of votes, and make them an even number, and then leave the half which
have the greater number of votes. and if two persons have an equal
number of votes, and thus increase the number beyond one-half, they
shall withdraw the younger of the two and do away the excess; and then
including all the rest they shall again vote, until there are left three
having an unequal number of votes. but if all the three, or two out of
the three, have equal votes, let them commit the election to good fate
and fortune, and separate off by lot the first, and the second, and the
third; these they shall crown with an olive wreath and give them the
prize of excellence, at the same time proclaiming to all the world
that the city of the magnetes, by the providence of the gods, is again
preserved, and presents to the sun and to apollo her three best men as
first-fruits, to be a common offering to them, according to the ancient
law, as long as their lives answer to the judgment formed of them. and
these shall appoint in their first year twelve examiners, to continue
until each has completed seventy-five years, to whom three shall
afterwards be added yearly; and let these divide all the magistracies
into twelve parts, and prove the holders of them by every sort of test
to which a freeman may be subjected; and let them live while they hold
office in the precinct of helios and apollo, in which they were chosen,
and let each one form a judgment of some things individually, and of
others in company with his colleagues; and let him place a writing in
the agora about each magistracy, and what the magistrate ought to suffer
or pay, according to the decision of the examiners. and if a magistrate
does not admit that he has been justly judged, let him bring the
examiners before the select judges, and if he be acquitted by their
decision, let him, if he will, accuse the examiners themselves; if,
however, he be convicted, and have been condemned to death by the
examiners, let him die (and of course he can only die once): but any
other penalties which admit of being doubled let him suffer twice over.

and now let us pass under review the examiners themselves; what will
their examination be, and how conducted? during the life of these men,
whom the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue, they
shall have the first seat at all public assemblies, and at all hellenic
sacrifices and sacred missions, and other public and holy ceremonies in
which they share. the chiefs of each sacred mission shall be selected
from them, and they only of all the citizens shall be adorned with a
crown of laurel; they shall all be priests of apollo and helios; and one
of them, who is judged first of the priests created in that year, shall
be high priest; and they shall write up his name in each year to be a
measure of time as long as the city lasts; and after their death they
shall be laid out and carried to the grave and entombed in a manner
different from the other citizens. they shall be decked in a robe all
of white, and there shall be no crying or lamentation over them; but a
chorus of fifteen maidens, and another of boys, shall stand around the
bier on either side, hymning the praises of the departed priests in
alternate responses, declaring their blessedness in song all day long;
and at dawn a hundred of the youths who practise gymnastic exercises,
and whom the relations of the departed shall choose, shall carry the
bier to the sepulchre, the young men marching first, dressed in the garb
of warriors--the cavalry with their horses, the heavy-armed with their
arms, and the others in like manner. and boys near the bier and in front
of it shall sing their national hymn, and maidens shall follow behind,
and with them the women who have passed the age of child-bearing;
next, although they are interdicted from other burials, let priests
and priestesses follow, unless the pythian oracle forbid them; for this
burial is free from pollution. the place of burial shall be an oblong
vaulted chamber underground, constructed of tufa, which will last for
ever, having stone couches placed side by side. and here they will lay
the blessed person, and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of
earth and plant a grove of trees around on every side but one; and on
that side the sepulchre shall be allowed to extend for ever, and a new
mound will not be required. every year they shall have contests in music
and gymnastics, and in horsemanship, in honour of the dead. these are
the honours which shall be given to those who at the examination are
found blameless; but if any of them, trusting to the scrutiny being
over, should, after the judgment has been given, manifest the wickedness
of human nature, let the law ordain that he who pleases shall indict
him, and let the cause be tried in the following manner. in the first
place, the court shall be composed of the guardians of the law, and to
them the surviving examiners shall be added, as well as the court of
select judges; and let the pursuer lay his indictment in this form--he
shall say that so-and-so is unworthy of the prize of virtue and of his
office; and if the defendant be convicted let him be deprived of his
office, and of the burial, and of the other honours given him. but if
the prosecutor do not obtain the fifth part of the votes, let him, if
he be of the first-class, pay twelve minae, and eight if he be of the
second class, and six if he be of the third class, and two minae if he
be of the fourth class.

the so-called decision of rhadamanthus is worthy of all admiration. he
knew that the men of his own time believed and had no doubt that there
were gods, which was a reasonable belief in those days, because most men
were the sons of gods, and according to tradition he was one himself. he
appears to have thought that he ought to commit judgment to no man, but
to the gods only, and in this way suits were simply and speedily decided
by him. for he made the two parties take an oath respecting the points
in dispute, and so got rid of the matter speedily and safely. but now
that a certain portion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence
of the gods, and others imagine that they have no care of us, and the
opinion of most men, and of the worst men, is that in return for a small
sacrifice and a few flattering words they will be their accomplices in
purloining large sums and save them from many terrible punishments, the
way of rhadamanthus is no longer suited to the needs of justice; for as
the opinions of men about the gods are changed, the laws should also
be changed--in the granting of suits a rational legislation ought to do
away with the oaths of the parties on either side--he who obtains leave
to bring an action should write down the charges, but should not add
an oath; and the defendant in like manner should give his denial to the
magistrates in writing, and not swear; for it is a dreadful thing to
know, when many lawsuits are going on in a state, that almost half the
people who meet one another quite unconcernedly at the public meals and
in other companies and relations of private life are perjured. let the
law, then, be as follows: a judge who is about to give judgment shall
take an oath, and he who is choosing magistrates for the state shall
either vote on oath or with a voting tablet which he brings from
a temple; so too the judge of dances and of all music, and the
superintendents and umpires of gymnastic and equestrian contests, and
any matters in which, as far as men can judge, there is nothing to be
gained by a false oath; but all cases in which a denial confirmed by
an oath clearly results in a great advantage to the taker of the oath,
shall be decided without the oath of the parties to the suit, and the
presiding judges shall not permit either of them to use an oath for the
sake of persuading, nor to call down curses on himself and his race, nor
to use unseemly supplications or womanish laments. but they shall ever
be teaching and learning what is just in auspicious words; and he who
does otherwise shall be supposed to speak beside the point, and the
judges shall again bring him back to the question at issue. on the other
hand, strangers in their dealings with strangers shall as at present
have power to give and receive oaths, for they will not often grow old
in the city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to be the sons
and heirs of the land.

as to the initiation of private suits, let the manner of deciding causes
between all citizens be the same as in cases in which any freeman is
disobedient to the state in minor matters, of which the penalty is not
stripes, imprisonment, or death. but as regards attendance at choruses
or processions or other shows, and as regards public services, whether
the celebration of sacrifice in peace, or the payment of contributions
in war--in all these cases, first comes the necessity of providing a
remedy for the loss; and by those who will not obey, there shall be
security given to the officers whom the city and the law empower to
exact the sum due; and if they forfeit their security, let the goods
which they have pledged be sold and the money given to the city; but
if they ought to pay a larger sum, the several magistrates shall impose
upon the disobedient a suitable penalty, and bring them before the
court, until they are willing to do what they are ordered.

now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil only, and
has no foreign trade, must consider what it will do about the emigration
of its own people to other countries, and the reception of strangers
from elsewhere. about these matters the legislator has to consider,
and he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as he can. the
intercourse of cities with one another is apt to create a confusion of
manners; strangers are always suggesting novelties to strangers. when
states are well governed by good laws the mixture causes the greatest
possible injury; but seeing that most cities are the reverse of
well-ordered, the confusion which arises in them from the reception
of strangers, and from the citizens themselves rushing off into other
cities, when any one either young or old desires to travel anywhere
abroad at whatever time, is of no consequence. on the other hand, the
refusal of states to receive others, and for their own citizens never
to go to other places, is an utter impossibility, and to the rest of
the world is likely to appear ruthless and uncivilised; it is a practice
adopted by people who use harsh words, such as xenelasia or banishment
of strangers, and who have harsh and morose ways, as men think. and to
be thought or not to be thought well of by the rest of the world is no
light matter; for the many are not so far wrong in their judgment of who
are bad and who are good, as they are removed from the nature of
virtue in themselves. even bad men have a divine instinct which guesses
rightly, and very many who are utterly depraved form correct notions
and judgments of the differences between the good and bad. and the
generality of cities are quite right in exhorting us to value a
good reputation in the world, for there is no truth greater and more
important than this--that he who is really good (i am speaking of the
men who would be perfect) seeks for reputation with, but not without,
the reality of goodness. and our cretan colony ought also to acquire the
fairest and noblest reputation for virtue from other men; and there is
every reason to expect that, if the reality answers to the idea, she
will be one of the few well-ordered cities which the sun and the other
gods behold. wherefore, in the matter of journeys to other countries and
the reception of strangers, we enact as follows: in the first place, let
no one be allowed to go anywhere at all into a foreign country who is
less than forty years of age; and no one shall go in a private capacity,
but only in some public one, as a herald, or on an embassy, or on a
sacred mission. going abroad on an expedition or in war is not to be
included among travels of the class authorised by the state. to apollo
at delphi and to zeus at olympia and to nemea and to the isthmus,
citizens should be sent to take part in the sacrifices and games there
dedicated to the gods; and they should send as many as possible, and the
best and fairest that can be found, and they will make the city renowned
at holy meetings in time of peace, procuring a glory which shall be the
converse of that which is gained in war; and when they come home they
shall teach the young that the institutions of other states are inferior
to their own. and they shall send spectators of another sort, if they
have the consent of the guardians, being such citizens as desire to look
a little more at leisure at the doings of other men; and these no law
shall hinder. for a city which has no experience of good and bad men or
intercourse with them, can never be thoroughly and perfectly civilised,
nor, again, can the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by
habit only, and without an intelligent understanding of them. and there
always are in the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond
price, and who spring up quite as much in ill-ordered as in well-ordered
cities. these are they whom the citizens of a well-ordered city should
be ever seeking out, going forth over sea and over land to find him who
is incorruptible--that he may establish more firmly institutions in
his own state which are good already, and amend what is deficient; for
without this examination and enquiry a city will never continue perfect
any more than if the examination is ill-conducted.

cleinias: how can we have an examination and also a good one?

athenian: in this way: in the first place, our spectator shall be of not
less than fifty years of age; he must be a man of reputation, especially
in war, if he is to exhibit to other cities a model of the guardians of
the law, but when he is more than sixty years of age he shall no longer
continue in his office of spectator. and when he has carried on his
inspection during as many out of the ten years of his office as he
pleases, on his return home let him go to the assembly of those who
review the laws. this shall be a mixed body of young and old men, who
shall be required to meet daily between the hour of dawn and the rising
of the sun. they shall consist, in the first place, of the priests
who have obtained the rewards of virtue; and, in the second place,
of guardians of the law, the ten eldest being chosen; the general
superintendent of education shall also be a member, as well as the last
appointed as those who have been released from the office; and each of
them shall take with him as his companion a young man, whomsoever he
chooses, between the ages of thirty and forty. these shall be always
holding conversation and discourse about the laws of their own city
or about any specially good ones which they may hear to be existing
elsewhere; also about kinds of knowledge which may appear to be of use
and will throw light upon the examination, or of which the want will
make the subject of laws dark and uncertain to them. any knowledge of
this sort which the elders approve, the younger men shall learn with all
diligence; and if any one of those who have been invited appear to be
unworthy, the whole assembly shall blame him who invited him. the rest
of the city shall watch over those among the young men who distinguish
themselves, having an eye upon them, and especially honouring them if
they succeed, but dishonouring them above the rest if they turn out
to be inferior. this is the assembly to which he who has visited the
institutions of other men, on his return home shall straightway go,
and if he have discovered any one who has anything to say about the
enactment of laws or education or nurture, or if he have himself made
any observations, let him communicate his discoveries to the whole
assembly. and if he be seen to have come home neither better nor worse,
let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm; and if he be much
better, let him be praised so much the more; and not only while he lives
but after his death let the assembly honour him with fitting honours.
but if on his return home he appear to have been corrupted, pretending
to be wise when he is not, let him hold no communication with any one,
whether young or old; and if he will hearken to the rulers, then he
shall be permitted to live as a private individual; but if he will not,
let him die, if he be convicted in a court of law of interfering about
education and the laws. and if he deserve to be indicted, and none of
the magistrates indict him, let that be counted as a disgrace to them
when the rewards of virtue are decided.

let such be the character of the person who goes abroad, and let him go
abroad under these conditions. in the next place, the stranger who comes
from abroad should be received in a friendly spirit. now there are four
kinds of strangers, of whom we must make some mention--the first is he
who comes and stays throughout the summer; this class are like birds of
passage, taking wing in pursuit of commerce, and flying over the sea
to other cities, while the season lasts; he shall be received in
market-places and harbours and public buildings, near the city but
outside, by those magistrates who are appointed to superintend these
matters; and they shall take care that a stranger, whoever he be, duly
receives justice; but he shall not be allowed to make any innovation.
they shall hold the intercourse with him which is necessary, and this
shall be as little as possible. the second kind is just a spectator who
comes to see with his eyes and hear with his ears the festivals of the
muses; such ought to have entertainment provided them at the temples by
hospitable persons, and the priests and ministers of the temples
should see and attend to them. but they should not remain more than a
reasonable time; let them see and hear that for the sake of which they
came, and then go away, neither having suffered nor done any harm. the
priests shall be their judges, if any of them receive or do any wrong up
to the sum of fifty drachmae, but if any greater charge be brought,
in such cases the suit shall come before the wardens of the agora. the
third kind of stranger is he who comes on some public business from
another land, and is to be received with public honours. he is to be
received only by the generals and commanders of horse and foot, and the
host by whom he is entertained, in conjunction with the prytanes, shall
have the sole charge of what concerns him. there is a fourth class of
persons answering to our spectators, who come from another land to look
at ours. in the first place, such visits will be rare, and the visitor
should be at least fifty years of age; he may possibly be wanting to
see something that is rich and rare in other states, or himself to show
something in like manner to another city. let such an one, then, go
unbidden to the doors of the wise and rich, being one of them himself:
let him go, for example, to the house of the superintendent of
education, confident that he is a fitting guest of such a host, or let
him go to the house of some of those who have gained the prize of virtue
and hold discourse with them, both learning from them, and also teaching
them; and when he has seen and heard all, he shall depart, as a friend
taking leave of friends, and be honoured by them with gifts and suitable
tributes of respect. these are the customs, according to which our
city should receive all strangers of either sex who come from other
countries, and should send forth her own citizens, showing respect to
zeus, the god of hospitality, not forbidding strangers at meals and
sacrifices, as is the manner which prevails among the children of the
nile, nor driving them away by savage proclamations.

when a man becomes surety, let him give the security in a distinct form,
acknowledging the whole transaction in a written document, and in the
presence of not less than three witnesses if the sum be under a thousand
drachmae, and of not less than five witnesses if the sum be above a
thousand drachmae. the agent of a dishonest or untrustworthy seller
shall himself be responsible; both the agent and the principal shall
be equally liable. if a person wishes to find anything in the house of
another, he shall enter naked, or wearing only a short tunic and without
a girdle, having first taken an oath by the customary gods that he
expects to find it there; he shall then make his search, and the other
shall throw open his house and allow him to search things both sealed
and unsealed. and if a person will not allow the searcher to make his
search, he who is prevented shall go to law with him, estimating the
value of the goods after which he is searching, and if the other be
convicted he shall pay twice the value of the article. if the master
be absent from home, the dwellers in the house shall let him search the
unsealed property, and on the sealed property the searcher shall set
another seal, and shall appoint any one whom he likes to guard them
during five days; and if the master of the house be absent during a
longer time, he shall take with him the wardens of the city, and so make
his search, opening the sealed property as well as the unsealed, and
then, together with the members of the family and the wardens of the
city, he shall seal them up again as they were before. there shall be
a limit of time in the case of disputed things, and he who has had
possession of them during a certain time shall no longer be liable to be
disturbed. as to houses and lands there can be no dispute in this state
of ours; but if a man has any other possessions which he has used and
openly shown in the city and in the agora and in the temples, and no one
has put in a claim to them, and some one says that he was looking for
them during this time, and the possessor is proved to have made no
concealment, if they have continued for a year, the one having the goods
and the other looking for them, the claim of the seeker shall not be
allowed after the expiration of the year; or if he does not use or show
the lost property in the market or in the city, but only in the country,
and no one offers himself as the owner during five years, at the
expiration of the five years the claim shall be barred for ever after;
or if he uses them in the city but within the house, then the appointed
time of claiming the goods shall be three years, or ten years if he
has them in the country in private. and if he has them in another land,
there shall be no limit of time or prescription, but whenever the owner
finds them he may claim them.

if any one prevents another by force from being present at a trial,
whether a principal party or his witnesses; if the person prevented be
a slave, whether his own or belonging to another, the suit shall be
incomplete and invalid; but if he who is prevented be a freeman, besides
the suit being incomplete, the other who has prevented him shall be
imprisoned for a year, and shall be prosecuted for kidnapping by any
one who pleases. and if any one hinders by force a rival competitor in
gymnastic or music, or any other sort of contest, from being present
at the contest, let him who has a mind inform the presiding judges, and
they shall liberate him who is desirous of competing; and if they are
not able, and he who hinders the other from competing wins the prize,
then they shall give the prize of victory to him who is prevented, and
inscribe him as the conqueror in any temples which he pleases; and he
who hinders the other shall not be permitted to make any offering or
inscription having reference to that contest, and in any case he shall
be liable for damages, whether he be defeated or whether he conquer.

if any one knowingly receives anything which has been stolen, he shall
undergo the same punishment as the thief, and if a man receives an exile
he shall be punished with death. every man should regard the friend and
enemy of the state as his own friend and enemy; and if any one makes
peace or war with another on his own account, and without the authority
of the state, he, like the receiver of the exile, shall undergo the
penalty of death. and if any fraction of the city declare war or peace
against any, the generals shall indict the authors of this proceeding,
and if they are convicted death shall be the penalty. those who serve
their country ought to serve without receiving gifts, and there ought to
be no excusing or approving the saying, 'men should receive gifts as the
reward of good, but not of evil deeds'; for to know which we are doing,
and to stand fast by our knowledge, is no easy matter. the safest course
is to obey the law which says, 'do no service for a bribe,' and let him
who disobeys, if he be convicted, simply die. with a view to taxation,
for various reasons, every man ought to have had his property valued:
and the tribesmen should likewise bring a register of the yearly
produce to the wardens of the country, that in this way there may be
two valuations; and the public officers may use annually whichever on
consideration they deem the best, whether they prefer to take a certain
portion of the whole value, or of the annual revenue, after subtracting
what is paid to the common tables.

touching offerings to the gods, a moderate man should observe moderation
in what he offers. now the land and the hearth of the house of all men
is sacred to all gods; wherefore let no man dedicate them a second time
to the gods. gold and silver, whether possessed by private persons or in
temples, are in other cities provocative of envy, and ivory, the product
of a dead body, is not a proper offering; brass and iron, again, are
instruments of war; but of wood let a man bring what offering he likes,
provided it be a single block, and in like manner of stone, to the
public temples; of woven work let him not offer more than one woman can
execute in a month. white is a colour suitable to the gods, especially
in woven works, but dyes should only be used for the adornments of war.
the most divine of gifts are birds and images, and they should be such
as one painter can execute in a single day. and let all other offerings
follow a similar rule.

now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which the nature
and number have been described, and laws have been given about all the
most important contracts as far as this was possible, the next thing
will be to have justice done. the first of the courts shall consist of
elected judges, who shall be chosen by the plaintiff and the defendant
in common: these shall be called arbiters rather than judges. and in
the second court there shall be judges of the villages and tribes
corresponding to the twelvefold division of the land, and before these
the litigants shall go to contend for greater damages, if the suit be
not decided before the first judges; the defendant, if he be defeated
the second time, shall pay a fifth more than the damages mentioned in
the indictment; and if he find fault with his judges and would try a
third time, let him carry the suit before the select judges, and if he
be again defeated, let him pay the whole of the damages and half as much
again. and the plaintiff, if when defeated before the first judges he
persist in going on to the second, shall if he wins receive in addition
to the damages a fifth part more, and if defeated he shall pay a like
sum; but if he is not satisfied with the previous decision, and will
insist on proceeding to a third court, then if he win he shall receive
from the defendant the amount of the damages and, as i said before,
half as much again, and the plaintiff, if he lose, shall pay half of the
damages claimed. now the assignment by lot of judges to courts and the
completion of the number of them, and the appointment of servants to the
different magistrates, and the times at which the several causes
should be heard, and the votings and delays, and all the things that
necessarily concern suits, and the order of causes, and the time in
which answers have to be put in and parties are to appear--of these and
other things akin to these we have indeed already spoken, but there
is no harm in repeating what is right twice or thrice: all lesser and
easier matters which the elder legislator has omitted may be supplied by
the younger one. private courts will be sufficiently regulated in this
way, and the public and state courts, and those which the magistrates
must use in the administration of their several offices, exist in many
other states. many very respectable institutions of this sort have
been framed by good men, and from them the guardians of the law may
by reflection derive what is necessary for the order of our new state,
considering and correcting them, and bringing them to the test of
experience, until every detail appears to be satisfactorily determined;
and then putting the final seal upon them, and making them irreversible,
they shall use them for ever afterwards. as to what relates to the
silence of judges and the abstinence from words of evil omen and the
reverse, and the different notions of the just and good and honourable
which exist in our own as compared with other states, they have been
partly mentioned already, and another part of them will be mentioned
hereafter as we draw near the end. to all these matters he who would be
an equal judge shall justly look, and he shall possess writings about
them that he may learn them. for of all kinds of knowledge the knowledge
of good laws has the greatest power of improving the learner; otherwise
there would be no meaning in the divine and admirable law possessing
a name akin to mind (nous, nomos). and of all other words, such as the
praises and censures of individuals which occur in poetry and also in
prose, whether written down or uttered in daily conversation, whether
men dispute about them in the spirit of contention or weakly assent
to them, as is often the case--of all these the one sure test is the
writings of the legislator, which the righteous judge ought to have in
his mind as the antidote of all other words, and thus make himself
and the city stand upright, procuring for the good the continuance and
increase of justice, and for the bad, on the other hand, a
conversion from ignorance and intemperance, and in general from all
unrighteousness, as far as their evil minds can be healed, but to those
whose web of life is in reality finished, giving death, which is the
only remedy for souls in their condition, as i may say truly again and
again. and such judges and chiefs of judges will be worthy of receiving
praise from the whole city.

when the suits of the year are completed the following laws shall
regulate their execution: in the first place, the judge shall assign to
the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who loses, with
the exception of mere necessaries, and the assignment shall be made
through the herald immediately after each decision in the hearing of
the judges; and when the month arrives following the month in which the
courts are sitting, (unless the gainer of the suit has been previously
satisfied) the court shall follow up the case, and hand over to the
winner the goods of the loser; but if they find that he has not the
means of paying, and the sum deficient is not less than a drachma, the
insolvent person shall not have any right of going to law with any other
man until he have satisfied the debt of the winning party; but other
persons shall still have the right of bringing suits against him. and if
any one after he is condemned refuses to acknowledge the authority
which condemned him, let the magistrates who are thus deprived of their
authority bring him before the court of the guardians of the law, and if
he be cast, let him be punished with death, as a subverter of the whole
state and of the laws.

thus a man is born and brought up, and after this manner he begets and
brings up his own children, and has his share of dealings with
other men, and suffers if he has done wrong to any one, and receives
satisfaction if he has been wronged, and so at length in due time he
grows old under the protection of the laws, and his end comes in the
order of nature. concerning the dead of either sex, the religious
ceremonies which may fittingly be performed, whether appertaining to the
gods of the under-world or of this, shall be decided by the interpreters
with absolute authority. their sepulchres are not to be in places which
are fit for cultivation, and there shall be no monuments in such spots,
either large or small, but they shall occupy that part of the country
which is naturally adapted for receiving and concealing the bodies of
the dead with as little hurt as possible to the living. no man, living
or dead, shall deprive the living of the sustenance which the earth,
their foster-parent, is naturally inclined to provide for them. and
let not the mound be piled higher than would be the work of five men
completed in five days; nor shall the stone which is placed over the
spot be larger than would be sufficient to receive the praises of the
dead included in four heroic lines. nor shall the laying out of the
dead in the house continue for a longer time than is sufficient to
distinguish between him who is in a trance only and him who is really
dead, and speaking generally, the third day after death will be a fair
time for carrying out the body to the sepulchre. now we must believe the
legislator when he tells us that the soul is in all respects superior to
the body, and that even in life what makes each one of us to be what we
are is only the soul; and that the body follows us about in the likeness
of each of us, and therefore, when we are dead, the bodies of the dead
are quite rightly said to be our shades or images; for the true and
immortal being of each one of us which is called the soul goes on her
way to other gods, before them to give an account--which is an inspiring
hope to the good, but very terrible to the bad, as the laws of our
fathers tell us; and they also say that not much can be done in the way
of helping a man after he is dead. but the living--he should be helped
by all his kindred, that while in life he may be the holiest and justest
of men, and after death may have no great sins to be punished in the
world below. if this be true, a man ought not to waste his substance
under the idea that all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process
of burial is connected with him; he should consider that the son, or
brother, or the beloved one, whoever he may be, whom he thinks he
is laying in the earth, has gone away to complete and fulfil his own
destiny, and that his duty is rightly to order the present, and to spend
moderately on the lifeless altar of the gods below. but the legislator
does not intend moderation to be taken in the sense of meanness. let the
law, then, be as follows: the expenditure on the entire funeral of him
who is of the highest class, shall not exceed five minae; and for him
who is of the second class, three minae, and for him who is of the third
class, two minae, and for him who is of the fourth class, one mina,
will be a fair limit of expense. the guardians of the law ought to
take especial care of the different ages of life, whether childhood, or
manhood, or any other age. and at the end of all, let there be some one
guardian of the law presiding, who shall be chosen by the friends of
the deceased to superintend, and let it be glory to him to manage with
fairness and moderation what relates to the dead, and a discredit to him
if they are not well managed. let the laying out and other ceremonies be
in accordance with custom, but to the statesman who adopts custom as his
law we must give way in certain particulars. it would be monstrous for
example that he should command any man to weep or abstain from weeping
over the dead; but he may forbid cries of lamentation, and not allow the
voice of the mourner to be heard outside the house; also, he may forbid
the bringing of the dead body into the open streets, or the processions
of mourners in the streets, and may require that before daybreak they
should be outside the city. let these, then, be our laws relating to
such matters, and let him who obeys be free from penalty; but he who
disobeys even a single guardian of the law shall be punished by them all
with a fitting penalty. other modes of burial, or again the denial of
burial, which is to be refused in the case of robbers of temples and
parricides and the like, have been devised and are embodied in the
preceding laws, so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearly at
an end; but in all cases the end does not consist in doing something or
acquiring something or establishing something--the end will be attained
and finally accomplished, when we have provided for the perfect and
lasting continuance of our institutions; until then our creation is
incomplete.

cleinias: that is very good, stranger; but i wish you would tell me more
clearly what you mean.

athenian: o cleinias, many things of old time were well said and sung;
and the saying about the fates was one of them.

cleinias: what is it?

athenian: the saying that lachesis or the giver of the lots is the first
of them, and that clotho or the spinster is the second of them, and that
atropos or the unchanging one is the third of them; and that she is
the preserver of the things which we have spoken, and which have been
compared in a figure to things woven by fire, they both (i.e. atropos
and the fire) producing the quality of unchangeableness. i am speaking
of the things which in a state and government give not only health and
salvation to the body, but law, or rather preservation of the law, in
the soul; and, if i am not mistaken, this seems to be still wanting
in our laws: we have still to see how we can implant in them this
irreversible nature.

cleinias: it will be no small matter if we can only discover how such a
nature can be implanted in anything.

athenian: but it certainly can be; so much i clearly see.

cleinias: then let us not think of desisting until we have imparted this
quality to our laws; for it is ridiculous, after a great deal of labour
has been spent, to place a thing at last on an insecure foundation.

athenian: i approve of your suggestion, and am quite of the same mind
with you.

cleinias: very good: and now what, according to you, is to be the
salvation of our government and of our laws, and how is it to be
effected?

athenian: were we not saying that there must be in our city a council
which was to be of this sort: the ten oldest guardians of the law, and
all those who have obtained prizes of virtue, were to meet in the same
assembly, and the council was also to include those who had visited
foreign countries in the hope of hearing something that might be of use
in the preservation of the laws, and who, having come safely home, and
having been tested in these same matters, had proved themselves to be
worthy to take part in the assembly--each of the members was to select
some young man of not less than thirty years of age, he himself judging
in the first instance whether the young man was worthy by nature and
education, and then suggesting him to the others, and if he seemed to
them also to be worthy they were to adopt him; but if not, the decision
at which they arrived was to be kept a secret from the citizens at
large, and, more especially, from the rejected candidate. the meeting of
the council was to be held early in the morning, when everybody was most
at leisure from all other business, whether public or private--was not
something of this sort said by us before?

cleinias: true.

athenian: then, returning to the council, i would say further, that
if we let it down to be the anchor of the state, our city, having
everything which is suitable to her, will preserve all that we wish to
preserve.

cleinias: what do you mean?

athenian: now is the time for me to speak the truth in all earnestness.

cleinias: well said, and i hope that you will fulfil your intention.

athenian: know, cleinias, that everything, in all that it does, has a
natural saviour, as of an animal the soul and the head are the chief
saviours.

cleinias: once more, what do you mean?

athenian: the well-being of those two is obviously the preservation of
every living thing.

cleinias: how is that?

athenian: the soul, besides other things, contains mind, and the head,
besides other things, contains sight and hearing; and the mind, mingling
with the noblest of the senses, and becoming one with them, may be truly
called the salvation of all.

cleinias: yes, quite so.

athenian: yes, indeed; but with what is that intellect concerned which,
mingling with the senses, is the salvation of ships in storms as well as
in fair weather? in a ship, when the pilot and the sailors unite their
perceptions with the piloting mind, do they not save both themselves and
their craft?

cleinias: very true.

athenian: we do not want many illustrations about such matters: what aim
would the general of an army, or what aim would a physician propose to
himself, if he were seeking to attain salvation?

cleinias: very good.

athenian: does not the general aim at victory and superiority in war,
and do not the physician and his assistants aim at producing health in
the body?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and a physician who is ignorant about the body, that is to
say, who knows not that which we just now called health, or a general
who knows not victory, or any others who are ignorant of the particulars
of the arts which we mentioned, cannot be said to have understanding
about any of these matters.

cleinias: they cannot.

athenian: and what would you say of the state? if a person proves to be
ignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look, ought he, in the
first place, to be called a ruler at all; and further, will he ever be
able to preserve that of which he does not even know the aim?

cleinias: impossible.

athenian: and therefore, if our settlement of the country is to be
perfect, we ought to have some institution, which, as i was saying,
will tell what is the aim of the state, and will inform us how we are
to attain this, and what law or what man will advise us to that end. any
state which has no such institution is likely to be devoid of mind and
sense, and in all her actions will proceed by mere chance.

cleinias: very true.

athenian: in which, then, of the parts or institutions of the state is
any such guardian power to be found? can we say?

cleinias: i am not quite certain, stranger; but i have a suspicion that
you are referring to the assembly which you just now said was to meet at
night.

athenian: you understand me perfectly, cleinias; and we must assume, as
the argument implies, that this council possesses all virtue; and the
beginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many things, but
to look steadily at one thing, and on this to fix all our aims.

cleinias: quite true.

athenian: then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful in states
going astray--the reason is that their legislators have such different
aims; nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down as their rule
of justice, that certain individuals should bear rule in the state,
whether they be good or bad, and others that the citizens should be
rich, not caring whether they are the slaves of other men or not. the
tendency of others, again, is towards freedom; and some legislate with
a view to two things at once--they want to be at the same time free and
the lords of other states; but the wisest men, as they deem themselves
to be, look to all these and similar aims, and there is no one of them
which they exclusively honour, and to which they would have all things
look.

cleinias: then, stranger, our former assertion will hold; for we were
saying that laws generally should look to one thing only; and this, as
we admitted, was rightly said to be virtue.

athenian: yes.

cleinias: and we said that virtue was of four kinds?

athenian: quite true.

cleinias: and that mind was the leader of the four, and that to her the
three other virtues and all other things ought to have regard?

athenian: you follow me capitally, cleinias, and i would ask you to
follow me to the end, for we have already said that the mind of the
pilot, the mind of the physician and of the general look to that
one thing to which they ought to look; and now we may turn to mind
political, of which, as of a human creature, we will ask a question: o
wonderful being, and to what are you looking? the physician is able
to tell his single aim in life, but you, the superior, as you declare
yourself to be, of all intelligent beings, when you are asked are not
able to tell. can you, megillus, and you, cleinias, say distinctly what
is the aim of mind political, in return for the many explanations of
things which i have given you?

cleinias: we cannot, stranger.

athenian: well, but ought we not to desire to see it, and to see where
it is to be found?

cleinias: for example, where?

athenian: for example, we were saying that there are four kinds of
virtue, and as there are four of them, each of them must be one.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and further, all four of them we call one; for we say that
courage is virtue, and that prudence is virtue, and the same of the two
others, as if they were in reality not many but one, that is, virtue.

cleinias: quite so.

athenian: there is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differ
from one another, and have received two names, and so of the rest. but
there is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and the
rest of them by the single name of virtue.

cleinias: how do you mean?

athenian: i have no difficulty in explaining what i mean. let us
distribute the subject into questions and answers.

cleinias: once more, what do you mean?

athenian: ask me what is that one thing which i call virtue, and then
again speak of as two, one part being courage and the other wisdom. i
will tell you how that occurs: one of them has to do with fear; in this
the beasts also participate, and quite young children--i mean courage;
for a courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason. but
without reason there never has been, or is, or will be a wise and
understanding soul; it is of a different nature.

cleinias: that is true.

athenian: i have now told you in what way the two are different, and
do you in return tell me in what way they are one and the same. suppose
that i ask you in what way the four are one, and when you have answered
me, you will have a right to ask of me in return in what way they are
four; and then let us proceed to enquire whether in the case of things
which have a name and also a definition to them, true knowledge consists
in knowing the name only and not the definition. can he who is good
for anything be ignorant of all this without discredit where great and
glorious truths are concerned?

cleinias: i suppose not.

athenian: and is there anything greater to the legislator and the
guardian of the law, and to him who thinks that he excels all other men
in virtue, and has won the palm of excellence, than these very qualities
of which we are now speaking--courage, temperance, wisdom, justice?

cleinias: how can there be anything greater?

athenian: and ought not the interpreters, the teachers, the lawgivers,
the guardians of the other citizens, to excel the rest of mankind,
and perfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evil
actions require to be punished and reproved, what is the nature of
virtue and vice? or shall some poet who has found his way into the city,
or some chance person who pretends to be an instructor of youth, show
himself to be better than him who has won the prize for every virtue?
and can we wonder that when the guardians are not adequate in speech
or action, and have no adequate knowledge of virtue, the city being
unguarded should experience the common fate of cities in our day?

cleinias: wonder! no.

athenian: well, then, must we do as we said? or can we give our
guardians a more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than
the many have? or is there any way in which our city can be made to
resemble the head and senses of rational beings because possessing such
a guardian power?

cleinias: what, stranger, is the drift of your comparison?

athenian: do we not see that the city is the trunk, and are not the
younger guardians, who are chosen for their natural gifts, placed in the
head of the state, having their souls all full of eyes, with which
they look about the whole city? they keep watch and hand over their
perceptions to the memory, and inform the elders of all that happens in
the city; and those whom we compared to the mind, because they have many
wise thoughts--that is to say, the old men--take counsel, and making use
of the younger men as their ministers, and advising with them--in this
way both together truly preserve the whole state: shall this or some
other be the order of our state? are all our citizens to be equal in
acquirements, or shall there be special persons among them who have
received a more careful training and education?

cleinias: that they should be equal, my good sir, is impossible.

athenian: then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than any
which has preceded.

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: and must not that of which we are in need be the one to which
we were just now alluding?

cleinias: very true.

athenian: did we not say that the workman or guardian, if he be perfect
in every respect, ought not only to be able to see the many aims, but he
should press onward to the one? this he should know, and knowing, order
all things with a view to it.

cleinias: true.

athenian: and can any one have a more exact way of considering or
contemplating anything, than the being able to look at one idea gathered
from many different things?

cleinias: perhaps not.

athenian: not 'perhaps not,' but 'certainly not,' my good sir, is the
right answer. there never has been a truer method than this discovered
by any man.

cleinias: i bow to your authority, stranger; let us proceed in the way
which you propose.

athenian: then, as would appear, we must compel the guardians of our
divine state to perceive, in the first place, what that principle is
which is the same in all the four--the same, as we affirm, in courage
and in temperance, and in justice and in prudence, and which, being one,
we call as we ought, by the single name of virtue. to this, my friends,
we will, if you please, hold fast, and not let go until we have
sufficiently explained what that is to which we are to look, whether to
be regarded as one, or as a whole, or as both, or in whatever way. are
we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition, if we cannot tell whether
virtue is many, or four, or one? certainly, if we take counsel among
ourselves, we shall in some way contrive that this principle has a place
amongst us; but if you have made up your mind that we should let the
matter alone, we will.

cleinias: we must not, stranger, by the god of strangers i swear that we
must not, for in our opinion you speak most truly; but we should like to
know how you will accomplish your purpose.

athenian: wait a little before you ask; and let us, first of all, be
quite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be accomplished.

cleinias: certainly, it ought to be, if it can be.

athenian: well, and about the good and the honourable, are we to take
the same view? are our guardians only to know that each of them is many,
or also how and in what way they are one?

cleinias: they must consider also in what sense they are one.

athenian: and are they to consider only, and to be unable to set forth
what they think?

cleinias: certainly not; that would be the state of a slave.

athenian: and may not the same be said of all good things--that the true
guardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them, and to be able
to interpret them in words, and carry them out in action, judging of
what is and of what is not well, according to nature?

cleinias: certainly.

athenian: is not the knowledge of the gods which we have set forth with
so much zeal one of the noblest sorts of knowledge--to know that they
are, and know how great is their power, as far as in man lies? we do
indeed excuse the mass of the citizens, who only follow the voice of
the laws, but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour to
obtain every possible evidence that there is respecting the gods; our
city is forbidden and not allowed to choose as a guardian of the law, or
to place in the select order of virtue, him who is not an inspired man,
and has not laboured at these things.

cleinias: it is certainly just, as you say, that he who is indolent
about such matters or incapable should be rejected, and that things
honourable should be put away from him.

athenian: are we assured that there are two things which lead men to
believe in the gods, as we have already stated?

cleinias: what are they?

athenian: one is the argument about the soul, which has been already
mentioned--that it is the eldest and most divine of all things, to which
motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence; the other was an
argument from the order of the motion of the stars, and of all things
under the dominion of the mind which ordered the universe. if a man look
upon the world not lightly or ignorantly, there was never any one so
godless who did not experience an effect opposite to that which the many
imagine. for they think that those who handle these matters by the help
of astronomy, and the accompanying arts of demonstration, may become
godless, because they see, as far as they can see, things happening by
necessity, and not by an intelligent will accomplishing good.

cleinias: but what is the fact?

athenian: just the opposite, as i said, of the opinion which once
prevailed among men, that the sun and stars are without soul. even in
those days men wondered about them, and that which is now ascertained
was then conjectured by some who had a more exact knowledge of
them--that if they had been things without soul, and had no mind, they
could never have moved with numerical exactness so wonderful; and even
at that time some ventured to hazard the conjecture that mind was the
orderer of the universe. but these same persons again mistaking the
nature of the soul, which they conceived to be younger and not older
than the body, once more overturned the world, or rather, i should say,
themselves; for the bodies which they saw moving in heaven all appeared
to be full of stones, and earth, and many other lifeless substances, and
to these they assigned the causes of all things. such studies gave
rise to much atheism and perplexity, and the poets took occasion to be
abusive--comparing the philosophers to she-dogs uttering vain howlings,
and talking other nonsense of the same sort. but now, as i said, the
case is reversed.

cleinias: how so?

athenian: no man can be a true worshipper of the gods who does not know
these two principles--that the soul is the eldest of all things which
are born, and is immortal and rules over all bodies; moreover, as i have
now said several times, he who has not contemplated the mind of nature
which is said to exist in the stars, and gone through the previous
training, and seen the connexion of music with these things, and
harmonized them all with laws and institutions, is not able to give a
reason of such things as have a reason. and he who is unable to acquire
this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen, can hardly be a
good ruler of a whole state; but he should be the subordinate of other
rulers. wherefore, cleinias and megillus, let us consider whether we
may not add to all the other laws which we have discussed this further
one--that the nocturnal assembly of the magistrates, which has also
shared in the whole scheme of education proposed by us, shall be a guard
set according to law for the salvation of the state. shall we propose
this?

cleinias: certainly, my good friend, we will if the thing is in any
degree possible.

athenian: let us make a common effort to gain such an object; for i
too will gladly share in the attempt. of these matters i have had much
experience, and have often considered them, and i dare say that i shall
be able to find others who will also help.

cleinias: i agree, stranger, that we should proceed along the road in
which god is guiding us; and how we can proceed rightly has now to be
investigated and explained.

athenian: o megillus and cleinias, about these matters we cannot
legislate further until the council is constituted; when that is done,
then we will determine what authority they shall have of their own; but
the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only be given
rightly in a long discourse.

cleinias: what do you mean, and what new thing is this?

athenian: in the first place, a list would have to be made out of those
who by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are well
fitted for the duty of a guardian. in the next place, it will not be
easy for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn, or become
the disciple of one who has already made the discovery. furthermore, to
write down the times at which, and during which, they ought to receive
the several kinds of instruction, would be a vain thing; for the
learners themselves do not know what is learned to advantage until the
knowledge which is the result of learning has found a place in the soul
of each. and so these details, although they could not be truly said
to be secret, might be said to be incapable of being stated beforehand,
because when stated they would have no meaning.

cleinias: what then are we to do, stranger, under these circumstances?

athenian: as the proverb says, the answer is no secret, but open to all
of us: we must risk the whole on the chance of throwing, as they say,
thrice six or thrice ace, and i am willing to share with you the danger
by stating and explaining to you my views about education and nurture,
which is the question coming to the surface again. the danger is not a
slight or ordinary one, and i would advise you, cleinias, in particular,
to see to the matter; for if you order rightly the city of the magnetes,
or whatever name god may give it, you will obtain the greatest glory;
or at any rate you will be thought the most courageous of men in the
estimation of posterity. dear companions, if this our divine assembly
can only be established, to them we will hand over the city; none of the
present company of legislators, as i may call them, would hesitate about
that. and the state will be perfected and become a waking reality, which
a little while ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only,
mingling together reason and mind in one image, in the hope that our
citizens might be duly mingled and rightly educated; and being educated,
and dwelling in the citadel of the land, might become perfect guardians,
such as we have never seen in all our previous life, by reason of the
saving virtue which is in them.

megillus: dear cleinias, after all that has been said, either we must
detain the stranger, and by supplications and in all manner of ways

introduction.

of all the works of plato the symposium is the most perfect in form,
and may be truly thought to contain more than any commentator has ever
dreamed of; or, as goethe said of one of his own writings, more than the
author himself knew. for in philosophy as in prophecy glimpses of the
future may often be conveyed in words which could hardly have been
understood or interpreted at the time when they were uttered (compare
symp.)--which were wiser than the writer of them meant, and could not
have been expressed by him if he had been interrogated about them.
yet plato was not a mystic, nor in any degree affected by the eastern
influences which afterwards overspread the alexandrian world. he was
not an enthusiast or a sentimentalist, but one who aspired only to
see reasoned truth, and whose thoughts are clearly explained in his
language. there is no foreign element either of egypt or of asia to
be found in his writings. and more than any other platonic work the
symposium is greek both in style and subject, having a beauty 'as of
a statue,' while the companion dialogue of the phaedrus is marked by
a sort of gothic irregularity. more too than in any other of his
dialogues, plato is emancipated from former philosophies. the genius of
greek art seems to triumph over the traditions of pythagorean, eleatic,
or megarian systems, and 'the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy' has
at least a superficial reconcilement. (rep.)

an unknown person who had heard of the discourses in praise of love
spoken by socrates and others at the banquet of agathon is desirous of
having an authentic account of them, which he thinks that he can
obtain from apollodorus, the same excitable, or rather 'mad' friend of
socrates, who is afterwards introduced in the phaedo. he had imagined
that the discourses were recent. there he is mistaken: but they are
still fresh in the memory of his informant, who had just been repeating
them to glaucon, and is quite prepared to have another rehearsal of them
in a walk from the piraeus to athens. although he had not been present
himself, he had heard them from the best authority. aristodemus, who
is described as having been in past times a humble but inseparable
attendant of socrates, had reported them to him (compare xen. mem.).

the narrative which he had heard was as follows:--

aristodemus meeting socrates in holiday attire, is invited by him to
a banquet at the house of agathon, who had been sacrificing in
thanksgiving for his tragic victory on the day previous. but no sooner
has he entered the house than he finds that he is alone; socrates has
stayed behind in a fit of abstraction, and does not appear until the
banquet is half over. on his appearing he and the host jest a little;
the question is then asked by pausanias, one of the guests, 'what shall
they do about drinking? as they had been all well drunk on the day
before, and drinking on two successive days is such a bad thing.' this
is confirmed by the authority of eryximachus the physician, who further
proposes that instead of listening to the flute-girl and her 'noise'
they shall make speeches in honour of love, one after another, going
from left to right in the order in which they are reclining at the
table. all of them agree to this proposal, and phaedrus, who is
the 'father' of the idea, which he has previously communicated to
eryximachus, begins as follows:--

he descants first of all upon the antiquity of love, which is proved by
the authority of the poets; secondly upon the benefits which love gives
to man. the greatest of these is the sense of honour and dishonour.
the lover is ashamed to be seen by the beloved doing or suffering any
cowardly or mean act. and a state or army which was made up only of
lovers and their loves would be invincible. for love will convert the
veriest coward into an inspired hero.

and there have been true loves not only of men but of women also. such
was the love of alcestis, who dared to die for her husband, and in
recompense of her virtue was allowed to come again from the dead. but
orpheus, the miserable harper, who went down to hades alive, that he
might bring back his wife, was mocked with an apparition only, and
the gods afterwards contrived his death as the punishment of his
cowardliness. the love of achilles, like that of alcestis, was
courageous and true; for he was willing to avenge his lover patroclus,
although he knew that his own death would immediately follow: and
the gods, who honour the love of the beloved above that of the lover,
rewarded him, and sent him to the islands of the blest.

pausanias, who was sitting next, then takes up the tale:--he says that
phaedrus should have distinguished the heavenly love from the earthly,
before he praised either. for there are two loves, as there are two
aphrodites--one the daughter of uranus, who has no mother and is the
elder and wiser goddess, and the other, the daughter of zeus and dione,
who is popular and common. the first of the two loves has a noble
purpose, and delights only in the intelligent nature of man, and is
faithful to the end, and has no shadow of wantonness or lust. the second
is the coarser kind of love, which is a love of the body rather than of
the soul, and is of women and boys as well as of men. now the actions of
lovers vary, like every other sort of action, according to the manner of
their performance. and in different countries there is a difference of
opinion about male loves. some, like the boeotians, approve of them;
others, like the ionians, and most of the barbarians, disapprove of
them; partly because they are aware of the political dangers which ensue
from them, as may be seen in the instance of harmodius and aristogeiton.
at athens and sparta there is an apparent contradiction about them. for
at times they are encouraged, and then the lover is allowed to play all
sorts of fantastic tricks; he may swear and forswear himself (and 'at
lovers' perjuries they say jove laughs'); he may be a servant, and lie
on a mat at the door of his love, without any loss of character; but
there are also times when elders look grave and guard their young
relations, and personal remarks are made. the truth is that some of
these loves are disgraceful and others honourable. the vulgar love of
the body which takes wing and flies away when the bloom of youth is
over, is disgraceful, and so is the interested love of power or wealth;
but the love of the noble mind is lasting. the lover should be tested,
and the beloved should not be too ready to yield. the rule in our
country is that the beloved may do the same service to the lover in the
way of virtue which the lover may do to him.

a voluntary service to be rendered for the sake of virtue and wisdom is
permitted among us; and when these two customs--one the love of youth,
the other the practice of virtue and philosophy--meet in one, then the
lovers may lawfully unite. nor is there any disgrace to a disinterested
lover in being deceived: but the interested lover is doubly disgraced,
for if he loses his love he loses his character; whereas the noble
love of the other remains the same, although the object of his love is
unworthy: for nothing can be nobler than love for the sake of virtue.
this is that love of the heavenly goddess which is of great price to
individuals and cities, making them work together for their improvement.

the turn of aristophanes comes next; but he has the hiccough, and
therefore proposes that eryximachus the physician shall cure him
or speak in his turn. eryximachus is ready to do both, and after
prescribing for the hiccough, speaks as follows:--

he agrees with pausanias in maintaining that there are two kinds of
love; but his art has led him to the further conclusion that the empire
of this double love extends over all things, and is to be found in
animals and plants as well as in man. in the human body also there are
two loves; and the art of medicine shows which is the good and which is
the bad love, and persuades the body to accept the good and reject the
bad, and reconciles conflicting elements and makes them friends. every
art, gymnastic and husbandry as well as medicine, is the reconciliation
of opposites; and this is what heracleitus meant, when he spoke of a
harmony of opposites: but in strictness he should rather have spoken of
a harmony which succeeds opposites, for an agreement of disagreements
there cannot be. music too is concerned with the principles of love in
their application to harmony and rhythm. in the abstract, all is simple,
and we are not troubled with the twofold love; but when they are applied
in education with their accompaniments of song and metre, then the
discord begins. then the old tale has to be repeated of fair urania and
the coarse polyhymnia, who must be indulged sparingly, just as in my
own art of medicine care must be taken that the taste of the epicure be
gratified without inflicting upon him the attendant penalty of disease.

there is a similar harmony or disagreement in the course of the seasons
and in the relations of moist and dry, hot and cold, hoar frost and
blight; and diseases of all sorts spring from the excesses or disorders
of the element of love. the knowledge of these elements of love and
discord in the heavenly bodies is termed astronomy, in the relations of
men towards gods and parents is called divination. for divination is the
peacemaker of gods and men, and works by a knowledge of the tendencies
of merely human loves to piety and impiety. such is the power of love;
and that love which is just and temperate has the greatest power, and
is the source of all our happiness and friendship with the gods and with
one another. i dare say that i have omitted to mention many things which
you, aristophanes, may supply, as i perceive that you are cured of the
hiccough.

aristophanes is the next speaker:--

he professes to open a new vein of discourse, in which he begins by
treating of the origin of human nature. the sexes were originally three,
men, women, and the union of the two; and they were made round--having
four hands, four feet, two faces on a round neck, and the rest to
correspond. terrible was their strength and swiftness; and they were
essaying to scale heaven and attack the gods. doubt reigned in the
celestial councils; the gods were divided between the desire of quelling
the pride of man and the fear of losing the sacrifices. at last zeus hit
upon an expedient. let us cut them in two, he said; then they will only
have half their strength, and we shall have twice as many sacrifices. he
spake, and split them as you might split an egg with an hair; and when
this was done, he told apollo to give their faces a twist and re-arrange
their persons, taking out the wrinkles and tying the skin in a knot
about the navel. the two halves went about looking for one another, and
were ready to die of hunger in one another's arms. then zeus invented an
adjustment of the sexes, which enabled them to marry and go their way
to the business of life. now the characters of men differ accordingly
as they are derived from the original man or the original woman, or the
original man-woman. those who come from the man-woman are lascivious and
adulterous; those who come from the woman form female attachments; those
who are a section of the male follow the male and embrace him, and in
him all their desires centre. the pair are inseparable and live together
in pure and manly affection; yet they cannot tell what they want of one
another. but if hephaestus were to come to them with his instruments
and propose that they should be melted into one and remain one here and
hereafter, they would acknowledge that this was the very expression of
their want. for love is the desire of the whole, and the pursuit of the
whole is called love. there was a time when the two sexes were only one,
but now god has halved them,--much as the lacedaemonians have cut up
the arcadians,--and if they do not behave themselves he will divide
them again, and they will hop about with half a nose and face in basso
relievo. wherefore let us exhort all men to piety, that we may obtain
the goods of which love is the author, and be reconciled to god, and
find our own true loves, which rarely happens in this world. and now i
must beg you not to suppose that i am alluding to pausanias and agathon
(compare protag.), for my words refer to all mankind everywhere.

some raillery ensues first between aristophanes and eryximachus, and
then between agathon, who fears a few select friends more than any
number of spectators at the theatre, and socrates, who is disposed to
begin an argument. this is speedily repressed by phaedrus, who reminds
the disputants of their tribute to the god. agathon's speech follows:--

he will speak of the god first and then of his gifts: he is the fairest
and blessedest and best of the gods, and also the youngest, having had
no existence in the old days of iapetus and cronos when the gods were
at war. the things that were done then were done of necessity and not
of love. for love is young and dwells in soft places,--not like ate
in homer, walking on the skulls of men, but in their hearts and
souls, which are soft enough. he is all flexibility and grace, and his
habitation is among the flowers, and he cannot do or suffer wrong; for
all men serve and obey him of their own free will, and where there is
love there is obedience, and where obedience, there is justice; for
none can be wronged of his own free will. and he is temperate as well as
just, for he is the ruler of the desires, and if he rules them he must
be temperate. also he is courageous, for he is the conqueror of the lord
of war. and he is wise too; for he is a poet, and the author of poesy in
others. he created the animals; he is the inventor of the arts; all the
gods are his subjects; he is the fairest and best himself, and the cause
of what is fairest and best in others; he makes men to be of one mind
at a banquet, filling them with affection and emptying them of
disaffection; the pilot, helper, defender, saviour of men, in whose
footsteps let every man follow, chanting a strain of love. such is the
discourse, half playful, half serious, which i dedicate to the god.

the turn of socrates comes next. he begins by remarking satirically
that he has not understood the terms of the original agreement, for he
fancied that they meant to speak the true praises of love, but now he
finds that they only say what is good of him, whether true or false. he
begs to be absolved from speaking falsely, but he is willing to speak
the truth, and proposes to begin by questioning agathon. the result of
his questions may be summed up as follows:--

love is of something, and that which love desires is not that which love
is or has; for no man desires that which he is or has. and love is of
the beautiful, and therefore has not the beautiful. and the beautiful
is the good, and therefore, in wanting and desiring the beautiful, love
also wants and desires the good. socrates professes to have asked the
same questions and to have obtained the same answers from diotima, a
wise woman of mantinea, who, like agathon, had spoken first of love and
then of his works. socrates, like agathon, had told her that love is a
mighty god and also fair, and she had shown him in return that love was
neither, but in a mean between fair and foul, good and evil, and not a
god at all, but only a great demon or intermediate power (compare the
speech of eryximachus) who conveys to the gods the prayers of men, and
to men the commands of the gods.

socrates asks: who are his father and mother? to this diotima replies
that he is the son of plenty and poverty, and partakes of the nature of
both, and is full and starved by turns. like his mother he is poor and
squalid, lying on mats at doors (compare the speech of pausanias);
like his father he is bold and strong, and full of arts and resources.
further, he is in a mean between ignorance and knowledge:--in this he
resembles the philosopher who is also in a mean between the wise and the
ignorant. such is the nature of love, who is not to be confused with the
beloved.

but love desires the beautiful; and then arises the question, what does
he desire of the beautiful? he desires, of course, the possession of
the beautiful;--but what is given by that? for the beautiful let us
substitute the good, and we have no difficulty in seeing the possession
of the good to be happiness, and love to be the desire of happiness,
although the meaning of the word has been too often confined to one
kind of love. and love desires not only the good, but the everlasting
possession of the good. why then is there all this flutter and
excitement about love? because all men and women at a certain age are
desirous of bringing to the birth. and love is not of beauty only, but
of birth in beauty; this is the principle of immortality in a mortal
creature. when beauty approaches, then the conceiving power is benign
and diffuse; when foulness, she is averted and morose.

but why again does this extend not only to men but also to animals?
because they too have an instinct of immortality. even in the same
individual there is a perpetual succession as well of the parts of the
material body as of the thoughts and desires of the mind; nay, even
knowledge comes and goes. there is no sameness of existence, but the new
mortality is always taking the place of the old. this is the reason why
parents love their children--for the sake of immortality; and this is
why men love the immortality of fame. for the creative soul creates not
children, but conceptions of wisdom and virtue, such as poets and other
creators have invented. and the noblest creations of all are those of
legislators, in honour of whom temples have been raised. who would not
sooner have these children of the mind than the ordinary human ones?
(compare bacon's essays, 8:--'certainly the best works and of greatest
merit for the public have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men;
which both in affection and means have married and endowed the public.')

i will now initiate you, she said, into the greater mysteries; for he
who would proceed in due course should love first one fair form, and
then many, and learn the connexion of them; and from beautiful bodies
he should proceed to beautiful minds, and the beauty of laws and
institutions, until he perceives that all beauty is of one kindred; and
from institutions he should go on to the sciences, until at last the
vision is revealed to him of a single science of universal beauty, and
then he will behold the everlasting nature which is the cause of all,
and will be near the end. in the contemplation of that supreme being of
love he will be purified of earthly leaven, and will behold beauty, not
with the bodily eye, but with the eye of the mind, and will bring forth
true creations of virtue and wisdom, and be the friend of god and heir
of immortality.

such, phaedrus, is the tale which i heard from the stranger of mantinea,
and which you may call the encomium of love, or what you please.

the company applaud the speech of socrates, and aristophanes is about to
say something, when suddenly a band of revellers breaks into the court,
and the voice of alcibiades is heard asking for agathon. he is led
in drunk, and welcomed by agathon, whom he has come to crown with
a garland. he is placed on a couch at his side, but suddenly, on
recognizing socrates, he starts up, and a sort of conflict is carried
on between them, which agathon is requested to appease. alcibiades then
insists that they shall drink, and has a large wine-cooler filled,
which he first empties himself, and then fills again and passes on to
socrates. he is informed of the nature of the entertainment; and is
ready to join, if only in the character of a drunken and disappointed
lover he may be allowed to sing the praises of socrates:--

he begins by comparing socrates first to the busts of silenus, which
have images of the gods inside them; and, secondly, to marsyas the
flute-player. for socrates produces the same effect with the voice which
marsyas did with the flute. he is the great speaker and enchanter
who ravishes the souls of men; the convincer of hearts too, as he has
convinced alcibiades, and made him ashamed of his mean and miserable
life. socrates at one time seemed about to fall in love with him; and he
thought that he would thereby gain a wonderful opportunity of receiving
lessons of wisdom. he narrates the failure of his design. he has
suffered agonies from him, and is at his wit's end. he then proceeds to
mention some other particulars of the life of socrates; how they were at
potidaea together, where socrates showed his superior powers of enduring
cold and fatigue; how on one occasion he had stood for an entire day and
night absorbed in reflection amid the wonder of the spectators; how on
another occasion he had saved alcibiades' life; how at the battle
of delium, after the defeat, he might be seen stalking about like a
pelican, rolling his eyes as aristophanes had described him in the
clouds. he is the most wonderful of human beings, and absolutely unlike
anyone but a satyr. like the satyr in his language too; for he uses the
commonest words as the outward mask of the divinest truths.

when alcibiades has done speaking, a dispute begins between him
and agathon and socrates. socrates piques alcibiades by a pretended
affection for agathon. presently a band of revellers appears, who
introduce disorder into the feast; the sober part of the company,
eryximachus, phaedrus, and others, withdraw; and aristodemus, the
follower of socrates, sleeps during the whole of a long winter's night.
when he wakes at cockcrow the revellers are nearly all asleep. only
socrates, aristophanes, and agathon hold out; they are drinking from a
large goblet, which they pass round, and socrates is explaining to the
two others, who are half-asleep, that the genius of tragedy is the same
as that of comedy, and that the writer of tragedy ought to be a writer
of comedy also. and first aristophanes drops, and then, as the day is
dawning, agathon. socrates, having laid them to rest, takes a bath and
goes to his daily avocations until the evening. aristodemus follows.

...

if it be true that there are more things in the symposium of plato than
any commentator has dreamed of, it is also true that many things have
been imagined which are not really to be found there. some writings
hardly admit of a more distinct interpretation than a musical
composition; and every reader may form his own accompaniment of thought
or feeling to the strain which he hears. the symposium of plato is a
work of this character, and can with difficulty be rendered in any words
but the writer's own. there are so many half-lights and cross-lights,
so much of the colour of mythology, and of the manner of sophistry
adhering--rhetoric and poetry, the playful and the serious, are so
subtly intermingled in it, and vestiges of old philosophy so curiously
blend with germs of future knowledge, that agreement among interpreters
is not to be expected. the expression 'poema magis putandum quam
comicorum poetarum,' which has been applied to all the writings of
plato, is especially applicable to the symposium.

the power of love is represented in the symposium as running through all
nature and all being: at one end descending to animals and plants, and
attaining to the highest vision of truth at the other. in an age
when man was seeking for an expression of the world around him, the
conception of love greatly affected him. one of the first distinctions
of language and of mythology was that of gender; and at a later period
the ancient physicist, anticipating modern science, saw, or thought
that he saw, a sex in plants; there were elective affinities among the
elements, marriages of earth and heaven. (aesch. frag. dan.) love became
a mythic personage whom philosophy, borrowing from poetry, converted
into an efficient cause of creation. the traces of the existence of
love, as of number and figure, were everywhere discerned; and in the
pythagorean list of opposites male and female were ranged side by side
with odd and even, finite and infinite.

but plato seems also to be aware that there is a mystery of love in man
as well as in nature, extending beyond the mere immediate relation of
the sexes. he is conscious that the highest and noblest things in the
world are not easily severed from the sensual desires, or may even be
regarded as a spiritualized form of them. we may observe that socrates
himself is not represented as originally unimpassioned, but as one who
has overcome his passions; the secret of his power over others partly
lies in his passionate but self-controlled nature. in the phaedrus and
symposium love is not merely the feeling usually so called, but the
mystical contemplation of the beautiful and the good. the same passion
which may wallow in the mire is capable of rising to the loftiest
heights--of penetrating the inmost secret of philosophy. the highest
love is the love not of a person, but of the highest and purest
abstraction. this abstraction is the far-off heaven on which the eye of
the mind is fixed in fond amazement. the unity of truth, the consistency
of the warring elements of the world, the enthusiasm for knowledge when
first beaming upon mankind, the relativity of ideas to the human
mind, and of the human mind to ideas, the faith in the invisible,
the adoration of the eternal nature, are all included, consciously or
unconsciously, in plato's doctrine of love.

the successive speeches in praise of love are characteristic of the
speakers, and contribute in various degrees to the final result; they
are all designed to prepare the way for socrates, who gathers up the
threads anew, and skims the highest points of each of them. but they are
not to be regarded as the stages of an idea, rising above one another
to a climax. they are fanciful, partly facetious performances, 'yet also
having a certain measure of seriousness,' which the successive speakers
dedicate to the god. all of them are rhetorical and poetical rather than
dialectical, but glimpses of truth appear in them. when eryximachus says
that the principles of music are simple in themselves, but confused
in their application, he touches lightly upon a difficulty which has
troubled the moderns as well as the ancients in music, and may be
extended to the other applied sciences. that confusion begins in the
concrete, was the natural feeling of a mind dwelling in the world of
ideas. when pausanias remarks that personal attachments are inimical
to despots. the experience of greek history confirms the truth of his
remark. when aristophanes declares that love is the desire of the whole,
he expresses a feeling not unlike that of the german philosopher, who
says that 'philosophy is home sickness.' when agathon says that no man
'can be wronged of his own free will,' he is alluding playfully to a
serious problem of greek philosophy (compare arist. nic. ethics). so
naturally does plato mingle jest and earnest, truth and opinion in the
same work.

the characters--of phaedrus, who has been the cause of more
philosophical discussions than any other man, with the exception of
simmias the theban (phaedrus); of aristophanes, who disguises under
comic imagery a serious purpose; of agathon, who in later life is
satirized by aristophanes in the thesmophoriazusae, for his effeminate
manners and the feeble rhythms of his verse; of alcibiades, who is the
same strange contrast of great powers and great vices, which meets us
in history--are drawn to the life; and we may suppose the less-known
characters of pausanias and eryximachus to be also true to the
traditional recollection of them (compare phaedr., protag.; and compare
sympos. with phaedr.). we may also remark that aristodemus is called
'the little' in xenophon's memorabilia (compare symp.).

the speeches have been said to follow each other in pairs: phaedrus and
pausanias being the ethical, eryximachus and aristophanes the physical
speakers, while in agathon and socrates poetry and philosophy blend
together. the speech of phaedrus is also described as the mythological,
that of pausanias as the political, that of eryximachus as the
scientific, that of aristophanes as the artistic (!), that of socrates
as the philosophical. but these and similar distinctions are not found
in plato;--they are the points of view of his critics, and seem to
impede rather than to assist us in understanding him.

when the turn of socrates comes round he cannot be allowed to disturb
the arrangement made at first. with the leave of phaedrus he asks a few
questions, and then he throws his argument into the form of a speech
(compare gorg., protag.). but his speech is really the narrative of a
dialogue between himself and diotima. and as at a banquet good manners
would not allow him to win a victory either over his host or any of
the guests, the superiority which he gains over agathon is ingeniously
represented as having been already gained over himself by her. the
artifice has the further advantage of maintaining his accustomed
profession of ignorance (compare menex.). even his knowledge of the
mysteries of love, to which he lays claim here and elsewhere (lys.), is
given by diotima.

the speeches are attested to us by the very best authority. the madman
apollodorus, who for three years past has made a daily study of the
actions of socrates--to whom the world is summed up in the words 'great
is socrates'--he has heard them from another 'madman,' aristodemus,
who was the 'shadow' of socrates in days of old, like him going about
barefooted, and who had been present at the time. 'would you desire
better witness?' the extraordinary narrative of alcibiades is
ingeniously represented as admitted by socrates, whose silence when he
is invited to contradict gives consent to the narrator. we may observe,
by the way, (1) how the very appearance of aristodemus by himself is
a sufficient indication to agathon that socrates has been left behind;
also, (2) how the courtesy of agathon anticipates the excuse which
socrates was to have made on aristodemus' behalf for coming uninvited;
(3) how the story of the fit or trance of socrates is confirmed by the
mention which alcibiades makes of a similar fit of abstraction occurring
when he was serving with the army at potidaea; like (4) the drinking
powers of socrates and his love of the fair, which receive a similar
attestation in the concluding scene; or the attachment of aristodemus,
who is not forgotten when socrates takes his departure. (5) we may
notice the manner in which socrates himself regards the first five
speeches, not as true, but as fanciful and exaggerated encomiums of the
god love; (6) the satirical character of them, shown especially in
the appeals to mythology, in the reasons which are given by zeus for
reconstructing the frame of man, or by the boeotians and eleans
for encouraging male loves; (7) the ruling passion of socrates for
dialectics, who will argue with agathon instead of making a speech, and
will only speak at all upon the condition that he is allowed to speak
the truth. we may note also the touch of socratic irony, (8) which
admits of a wide application and reveals a deep insight into the
world:--that in speaking of holy things and persons there is a general
understanding that you should praise them, not that you should speak the
truth about them--this is the sort of praise which socrates is unable to
give. lastly, (9) we may remark that the banquet is a real banquet after
all, at which love is the theme of discourse, and huge quantities of
wine are drunk.

the discourse of phaedrus is half-mythical, half-ethical; and he
himself, true to the character which is given him in the dialogue
bearing his name, is half-sophist, half-enthusiast. he is the critic
of poetry also, who compares homer and aeschylus in the insipid
and irrational manner of the schools of the day, characteristically
reasoning about the probability of matters which do not admit of
reasoning. he starts from a noble text: 'that without the sense of
honour and dishonour neither states nor individuals ever do any good
or great work.' but he soon passes on to more common-place topics. the
antiquity of love, the blessing of having a lover, the incentive which
love offers to daring deeds, the examples of alcestis and achilles, are
the chief themes of his discourse. the love of women is regarded by him
as almost on an equality with that of men; and he makes the singular
remark that the gods favour the return of love which is made by the
beloved more than the original sentiment, because the lover is of a
nobler and diviner nature.

there is something of a sophistical ring in the speech of phaedrus,
which recalls the first speech in imitation of lysias, occurring in the
dialogue called the phaedrus. this is still more marked in the speech of
pausanias which follows; and which is at once hyperlogical in form and
also extremely confused and pedantic. plato is attacking the logical
feebleness of the sophists and rhetoricians, through their pupils, not
forgetting by the way to satirize the monotonous and unmeaning rhythms
which prodicus and others were introducing into attic prose (compare
protag.). of course, he is 'playing both sides of the game,' as in the
gorgias and phaedrus; but it is not necessary in order to understand him
that we should discuss the fairness of his mode of proceeding. the
love of pausanias for agathon has already been touched upon in the
protagoras, and is alluded to by aristophanes. hence he is naturally the
upholder of male loves, which, like all the other affections or
actions of men, he regards as varying according to the manner of their
performance. like the sophists and like plato himself, though in a
different sense, he begins his discussion by an appeal to mythology,
and distinguishes between the elder and younger love. the value which
he attributes to such loves as motives to virtue and philosophy is at
variance with modern and christian notions, but is in accordance with
hellenic sentiment. the opinion of christendom has not altogether
condemned passionate friendships between persons of the same sex, but
has certainly not encouraged them, because though innocent in themselves
in a few temperaments they are liable to degenerate into fearful evil.
pausanias is very earnest in the defence of such loves; and he speaks of
them as generally approved among hellenes and disapproved by barbarians.
his speech is 'more words than matter,' and might have been composed by
a pupil of lysias or of prodicus, although there is no hint given that
plato is specially referring to them. as eryximachus says, 'he makes a
fair beginning, but a lame ending.'

plato transposes the two next speeches, as in the republic he would
transpose the virtues and the mathematical sciences. this is done partly
to avoid monotony, partly for the sake of making aristophanes 'the cause
of wit in others,' and also in order to bring the comic and tragic
poet into juxtaposition, as if by accident. a suitable 'expectation' of
aristophanes is raised by the ludicrous circumstance of his having the
hiccough, which is appropriately cured by his substitute, the physician
eryximachus. to eryximachus love is the good physician; he sees
everything as an intelligent physicist, and, like many professors of his
art in modern times, attempts to reduce the moral to the physical; or
recognises one law of love which pervades them both. there are loves
and strifes of the body as well as of the mind. like hippocrates the
asclepiad, he is a disciple of heracleitus, whose conception of the
harmony of opposites he explains in a new way as the harmony after
discord; to his common sense, as to that of many moderns as well as
ancients, the identity of contradictories is an absurdity. his notion of
love may be summed up as the harmony of man with himself in soul as well
as body, and of all things in heaven and earth with one another.

aristophanes is ready to laugh and make laugh before he opens his mouth,
just as socrates, true to his character, is ready to argue before he
begins to speak. he expresses the very genius of the old comedy, its
coarse and forcible imagery, and the licence of its language in speaking
about the gods. he has no sophistical notions about love, which
is brought back by him to its common-sense meaning of love between
intelligent beings. his account of the origin of the sexes has the
greatest (comic) probability and verisimilitude. nothing in aristophanes
is more truly aristophanic than the description of the human monster
whirling round on four arms and four legs, eight in all, with incredible
rapidity. yet there is a mixture of earnestness in this jest; three
serious principles seem to be insinuated:--first, that man cannot exist
in isolation; he must be reunited if he is to be perfected: secondly,
that love is the mediator and reconciler of poor, divided human nature:
thirdly, that the loves of this world are an indistinct anticipation of
an ideal union which is not yet realized.

the speech of agathon is conceived in a higher strain, and receives the
real, if half-ironical, approval of socrates. it is the speech of the
tragic poet and a sort of poem, like tragedy, moving among the gods of
olympus, and not among the elder or orphic deities. in the idea of the
antiquity of love he cannot agree; love is not of the olden time, but
present and youthful ever. the speech may be compared with that speech
of socrates in the phaedrus in which he describes himself as talking
dithyrambs. it is at once a preparation for socrates and a foil to him.
the rhetoric of agathon elevates the soul to 'sunlit heights,' but at
the same time contrasts with the natural and necessary eloquence of
socrates. agathon contributes the distinction between love and the works
of love, and also hints incidentally that love is always of beauty,
which socrates afterwards raises into a principle. while the
consciousness of discord is stronger in the comic poet aristophanes,
agathon, the tragic poet, has a deeper sense of harmony and
reconciliation, and speaks of love as the creator and artist.

all the earlier speeches embody common opinions coloured with a tinge of
philosophy. they furnish the material out of which socrates proceeds to
form his discourse, starting, as in other places, from mythology and
the opinions of men. from phaedrus he takes the thought that love is
stronger than death; from pausanias, that the true love is akin to
intellect and political activity; from eryximachus, that love is a
universal phenomenon and the great power of nature; from aristophanes,
that love is the child of want, and is not merely the love of the
congenial or of the whole, but (as he adds) of the good; from agathon,
that love is of beauty, not however of beauty only, but of birth
in beauty. as it would be out of character for socrates to make a
lengthened harangue, the speech takes the form of a dialogue between
socrates and a mysterious woman of foreign extraction. she elicits the
final truth from one who knows nothing, and who, speaking by the lips
of another, and himself a despiser of rhetoric, is proved also to be the
most consummate of rhetoricians (compare menexenus).

the last of the six discourses begins with a short argument which
overthrows not only agathon but all the preceding speakers by the help
of a distinction which has escaped them. extravagant praises have been
ascribed to love as the author of every good; no sort of encomium was
too high for him, whether deserved and true or not. but socrates has no
talent for speaking anything but the truth, and if he is to speak the
truth of love he must honestly confess that he is not a good at all: for
love is of the good, and no man can desire that which he has. this
piece of dialectics is ascribed to diotima, who has already urged
upon socrates the argument which he urges against agathon. that the
distinction is a fallacy is obvious; it is almost acknowledged to be so
by socrates himself. for he who has beauty or good may desire more of
them; and he who has beauty or good in himself may desire beauty and
good in others. the fallacy seems to arise out of a confusion between
the abstract ideas of good and beauty, which do not admit of degrees,
and their partial realization in individuals.

but diotima, the prophetess of mantineia, whose sacred and superhuman
character raises her above the ordinary proprieties of women, has taught
socrates far more than this about the art and mystery of love. she has
taught him that love is another aspect of philosophy. the same want in
the human soul which is satisfied in the vulgar by the procreation of
children, may become the highest aspiration of intellectual desire.
as the christian might speak of hungering and thirsting after
righteousness; or of divine loves under the figure of human (compare
eph. 'this is a great mystery, but i speak concerning christ and the
church'); as the mediaeval saint might speak of the 'fruitio dei;' as
dante saw all things contained in his love of beatrice, so plato would
have us absorb all other loves and desires in the love of knowledge.
here is the beginning of neoplatonism, or rather, perhaps, a proof (of
which there are many) that the so-called mysticism of the east was
not strange to the greek of the fifth century before christ. the first
tumult of the affections was not wholly subdued; there were longings of
a creature moving about in worlds not realized, which no art could
satisfy. to most men reason and passion appear to be antagonistic both
in idea and fact. the union of the greatest comprehension of knowledge
and the burning intensity of love is a contradiction in nature, which
may have existed in a far-off primeval age in the mind of some hebrew
prophet or other eastern sage, but has now become an imagination only.
yet this 'passion of the reason' is the theme of the symposium of plato.
and as there is no impossibility in supposing that 'one king, or son of
a king, may be a philosopher,' so also there is a probability that there
may be some few--perhaps one or two in a whole generation--in whom the
light of truth may not lack the warmth of desire. and if there be such
natures, no one will be disposed to deny that 'from them flow most of
the benefits of individuals and states;' and even from imperfect
combinations of the two elements in teachers or statesmen great good may
often arise.

yet there is a higher region in which love is not only felt, but
satisfied, in the perfect beauty of eternal knowledge, beginning with
the beauty of earthly things, and at last reaching a beauty in which
all existence is seen to be harmonious and one. the limited affection
is enlarged, and enabled to behold the ideal of all things. and here the
highest summit which is reached in the symposium is seen also to be the
highest summit which is attained in the republic, but approached from
another side; and there is 'a way upwards and downwards,' which is the
same and not the same in both. the ideal beauty of the one is the ideal
good of the other; regarded not with the eye of knowledge, but of faith
and desire; and they are respectively the source of beauty and the
source of good in all other things. and by the steps of a 'ladder
reaching to heaven' we pass from images of visible beauty (greek), and
from the hypotheses of the mathematical sciences, which are not yet
based upon the idea of good, through the concrete to the abstract, and,
by different paths arriving, behold the vision of the eternal (compare
symp. (greek) republic (greek) also phaedrus). under one aspect 'the
idea is love'; under another, 'truth.' in both the lover of wisdom is
the 'spectator of all time and of all existence.' this is a 'mystery'
in which plato also obscurely intimates the union of the spiritual and
fleshly, the interpenetration of the moral and intellectual faculties.

the divine image of beauty which resides within socrates has been
revealed; the silenus, or outward man, has now to be exhibited.
the description of socrates follows immediately after the speech of
socrates; one is the complement of the other. at the height of divine
inspiration, when the force of nature can no further go, by way of
contrast to this extreme idealism, alcibiades, accompanied by a troop of
revellers and a flute-girl, staggers in, and being drunk is able to tell
of things which he would have been ashamed to make known if he had been
sober. the state of his affections towards socrates, unintelligible to
us and perverted as they appear, affords an illustration of the power
ascribed to the loves of man in the speech of pausanias. he does not
suppose his feelings to be peculiar to himself: there are several other
persons in the company who have been equally in love with socrates,
and like himself have been deceived by him. the singular part of this
confession is the combination of the most degrading passion with the
desire of virtue and improvement. such an union is not wholly untrue to
human nature, which is capable of combining good and evil in a degree
beyond what we can easily conceive. in imaginative persons, especially,
the god and beast in man seem to part asunder more than is natural in
a well-regulated mind. the platonic socrates (for of the real socrates
this may be doubted: compare his public rebuke of critias for his
shameful love of euthydemus in xenophon, memorabilia) does not regard
the greatest evil of greek life as a thing not to be spoken of; but it
has a ridiculous element (plato's symp.), and is a subject for irony, no
less than for moral reprobation (compare plato's symp.). it is also used
as a figure of speech which no one interpreted literally (compare xen.
symp.). nor does plato feel any repugnance, such as would be felt in
modern times, at bringing his great master and hero into connexion with
nameless crimes. he is contented with representing him as a saint, who
has won 'the olympian victory' over the temptations of human nature. the
fault of taste, which to us is so glaring and which was recognized
by the greeks of a later age (athenaeus), was not perceived by plato
himself. we are still more surprised to find that the philosopher is
incited to take the first step in his upward progress (symp.) by the
beauty of young men and boys, which was alone capable of inspiring the
modern feeling of romance in the greek mind. the passion of love took
the spurious form of an enthusiasm for the ideal of beauty--a worship
as of some godlike image of an apollo or antinous. but the love of youth
when not depraved was a love of virtue and modesty as well as of beauty,
the one being the expression of the other; and in certain greek states,
especially at sparta and thebes, the honourable attachment of a youth to
an elder man was a part of his education. the 'army of lovers and their
beloved who would be invincible if they could be united by such a tie'
(symp.), is not a mere fiction of plato's, but seems actually to have
existed at thebes in the days of epaminondas and pelopidas, if we
may believe writers cited anonymously by plutarch, pelop. vit. it is
observable that plato never in the least degree excuses the depraved
love of the body (compare charm.; rep.; laws; symp.; and once more
xenophon, mem.), nor is there any greek writer of mark who condones or
approves such connexions. but owing partly to the puzzling nature of the
subject these friendships are spoken of by plato in a manner different
from that customary among ourselves. to most of them we should hesitate
to ascribe, any more than to the attachment of achilles and patroclus in
homer, an immoral or licentious character. there were many, doubtless,
to whom the love of the fair mind was the noblest form of friendship
(rep.), and who deemed the friendship of man with man to be higher
than the love of woman, because altogether separated from the bodily
appetites. the existence of such attachments may be reasonably
attributed to the inferiority and seclusion of woman, and the want of
a real family or social life and parental influence in hellenic cities;
and they were encouraged by the practice of gymnastic exercises, by the
meetings of political clubs, and by the tie of military companionship.
they were also an educational institution: a young person was specially
entrusted by his parents to some elder friend who was expected by them
to train their son in manly exercises and in virtue. it is not likely
that a greek parent committed him to a lover, any more than we should
to a schoolmaster, in the expectation that he would be corrupted by him,
but rather in the hope that his morals would be better cared for than
was possible in a great household of slaves.

it is difficult to adduce the authority of plato either for or against
such practices or customs, because it is not always easy to determine
whether he is speaking of 'the heavenly and philosophical love, or
of the coarse polyhymnia:' and he often refers to this (e.g. in the
symposium) half in jest, yet 'with a certain degree of seriousness.'
we observe that they entered into one part of greek literature, but not
into another, and that the larger part is free from such associations.
indecency was an element of the ludicrous in the old greek comedy, as
it has been in other ages and countries. but effeminate love was always
condemned as well as ridiculed by the comic poets; and in the new comedy
the allusions to such topics have disappeared. they seem to have been no
longer tolerated by the greater refinement of the age. false sentiment
is found in the lyric and elegiac poets; and in mythology 'the greatest
of the gods' (rep.) is not exempt from evil imputations. but the morals
of a nation are not to be judged of wholly by its literature. hellas
was not necessarily more corrupted in the days of the persian and
peloponnesian wars, or of plato and the orators, than england in the
time of fielding and smollett, or france in the nineteenth century. no
one supposes certain french novels to be a representation of ordinary
french life. and the greater part of greek literature, beginning
with homer and including the tragedians, philosophers, and, with the
exception of the comic poets (whose business was to raise a laugh
by whatever means), all the greater writers of hellas who have been
preserved to us, are free from the taint of indecency.

some general considerations occur to our mind when we begin to reflect
on this subject. (1) that good and evil are linked together in human
nature, and have often existed side by side in the world and in man to
an extent hardly credible. we cannot distinguish them, and are therefore
unable to part them; as in the parable 'they grow together unto the
harvest:' it is only a rule of external decency by which society can
divide them. nor should we be right in inferring from the prevalence of
any one vice or corruption that a state or individual was demoralized
in their whole character. not only has the corruption of the best been
sometimes thought to be the worst, but it may be remarked that this very
excess of evil has been the stimulus to good (compare plato, laws, where
he says that in the most corrupt cities individuals are to be found
beyond all praise). (2) it may be observed that evils which admit of
degrees can seldom be rightly estimated, because under the same name
actions of the most different degrees of culpability may be included. no
charge is more easily set going than the imputation of secret wickedness
(which cannot be either proved or disproved and often cannot be defined)
when directed against a person of whom the world, or a section of it, is
predisposed to think evil. and it is quite possible that the malignity
of greek scandal, aroused by some personal jealousy or party enmity, may
have converted the innocent friendship of a great man for a noble youth
into a connexion of another kind. such accusations were brought against
several of the leading men of hellas, e.g. cimon, alcibiades, critias,
demosthenes, epaminondas: several of the roman emperors were assailed
by similar weapons which have been used even in our own day against
statesmen of the highest character. (3) while we know that in this
matter there is a great gulf fixed between greek and christian ethics,
yet, if we would do justice to the greeks, we must also acknowledge that
there was a greater outspokenness among them than among ourselves about
the things which nature hides, and that the more frequent mention of
such topics is not to be taken as the measure of the prevalence of
offences, or as a proof of the general corruption of society. it is
likely that every religion in the world has used words or practised
rites in one age, which have become distasteful or repugnant to another.
we cannot, though for different reasons, trust the representations
either of comedy or satire; and still less of christian apologists.
(4) we observe that at thebes and lacedemon the attachment of an
elder friend to a beloved youth was often deemed to be a part of his
education; and was encouraged by his parents--it was only shameful if
it degenerated into licentiousness. such we may believe to have been the
tie which united asophychus and cephisodorus with the great epaminondas
in whose companionship they fell (plutarch, amat.; athenaeus on the
authority of theopompus). (5) a small matter: there appears to be a
difference of custom among the greeks and among ourselves, as between
ourselves and continental nations at the present time, in modes of
salutation. we must not suspect evil in the hearty kiss or embrace of
a male friend 'returning from the army at potidaea' any more than in
a similar salutation when practised by members of the same family. but
those who make these admissions, and who regard, not without pity, the
victims of such illusions in our own day, whose life has been blasted
by them, may be none the less resolved that the natural and healthy
instincts of mankind shall alone be tolerated (greek); and that the
lesson of manliness which we have inherited from our fathers shall not
degenerate into sentimentalism or effeminacy. the possibility of an
honourable connexion of this kind seems to have died out with greek
civilization. among the romans, and also among barbarians, such as the
celts and persians, there is no trace of such attachments existing in
any noble or virtuous form.

(compare hoeck's creta and the admirable and exhaustive article of meier
in ersch and grueber's cyclopedia on this subject; plutarch, amatores;
athenaeus; lysias contra simonem; aesch. c. timarchum.)

the character of alcibiades in the symposium is hardly less remarkable
than that of socrates, and agrees with the picture given of him in the
first of the two dialogues which are called by his name, and also with
the slight sketch of him in the protagoras. he is the impersonation of
lawlessness--'the lion's whelp, who ought not to be reared in the
city,' yet not without a certain generosity which gained the hearts of
men,--strangely fascinated by socrates, and possessed of a genius which
might have been either the destruction or salvation of athens. the
dramatic interest of the character is heightened by the recollection of
his after history. he seems to have been present to the mind of plato
in the description of the democratic man of the republic (compare also
alcibiades 1).

there is no criterion of the date of the symposium, except that which
is furnished by the allusion to the division of arcadia after the
destruction of mantinea. this took place in the year b.c. 384, which is
the forty-fourth year of plato's life. the symposium cannot therefore be
regarded as a youthful work. as mantinea was restored in the year 369,
the composition of the dialogue will probably fall between 384 and
369. whether the recollection of the event is more likely to have been
renewed at the destruction or restoration of the city, rather than at
some intermediate period, is a consideration not worth raising.

the symposium is connected with the phaedrus both in style and subject;
they are the only dialogues of plato in which the theme of love is
discussed at length. in both of them philosophy is regarded as a sort of
enthusiasm or madness; socrates is himself 'a prophet new inspired' with
bacchanalian revelry, which, like his philosophy, he characteristically
pretends to have derived not from himself but from others. the phaedo
also presents some points of comparison with the symposium. for there,
too, philosophy might be described as 'dying for love;' and there are
not wanting many touches of humour and fancy, which remind us of the
symposium. but while the phaedo and phaedrus look backwards and forwards
to past and future states of existence, in the symposium there is no
break between this world and another; and we rise from one to the other
by a regular series of steps or stages, proceeding from the particulars
of sense to the universal of reason, and from one universal to many,
which are finally reunited in a single science (compare rep.). at first
immortality means only the succession of existences; even knowledge
comes and goes. then follows, in the language of the mysteries, a higher
and a higher degree of initiation; at last we arrive at the perfect
vision of beauty, not relative or changing, but eternal and absolute;
not bounded by this world, or in or out of this world, but an aspect of
the divine, extending over all things, and having no limit of space or
time: this is the highest knowledge of which the human mind is capable.
plato does not go on to ask whether the individual is absorbed in the
sea of light and beauty or retains his personality. enough for him to
have attained the true beauty or good, without enquiring precisely into
the relation in which human beings stood to it. that the soul has such
a reach of thought, and is capable of partaking of the eternal nature,
seems to imply that she too is eternal (compare phaedrus). but plato
does not distinguish the eternal in man from the eternal in the world or
in god. he is willing to rest in the contemplation of the idea, which
to him is the cause of all things (rep.), and has no strength to go
further.

the symposium of xenophon, in which socrates describes himself as
a pander, and also discourses of the difference between sensual
and sentimental love, likewise offers several interesting points
of comparison. but the suspicion which hangs over other writings
of xenophon, and the numerous minute references to the phaedrus and
symposium, as well as to some of the other writings of plato, throw
a doubt on the genuineness of the work. the symposium of xenophon, if
written by him at all, would certainly show that he wrote against plato,
and was acquainted with his works. of this hostility there is no trace
in the memorabilia. such a rivalry is more characteristic of an imitator
than of an original writer. the (so-called) symposium of xenophon
may therefore have no more title to be regarded as genuine than the
confessedly spurious apology.

there are no means of determining the relative order in time of the
phaedrus, symposium, phaedo. the order which has been adopted in
this translation rests on no other principle than the desire to bring
together in a series the memorials of the life of socrates.




symposium


persons of the dialogue: apollodorus, who repeats to his companion
the dialogue which he had heard from aristodemus, and had already once
narrated to glaucon. phaedrus, pausanias, eryximachus, aristophanes,
agathon, socrates, alcibiades, a troop of revellers.

scene: the house of agathon.


concerning the things about which you ask to be informed i believe that
i am not ill-prepared with an answer. for the day before yesterday i
was coming from my own home at phalerum to the city, and one of my
acquaintance, who had caught a sight of me from behind, calling out
playfully in the distance, said: apollodorus, o thou phalerian (probably
a play of words on (greek), 'bald-headed.') man, halt! so i did as i
was bid; and then he said, i was looking for you, apollodorus, only just
now, that i might ask you about the speeches in praise of love, which
were delivered by socrates, alcibiades, and others, at agathon's supper.
phoenix, the son of philip, told another person who told me of them;
his narrative was very indistinct, but he said that you knew, and i wish
that you would give me an account of them. who, if not you, should be
the reporter of the words of your friend? and first tell me, he said,
were you present at this meeting?

your informant, glaucon, i said, must have been very indistinct indeed,
if you imagine that the occasion was recent; or that i could have been
of the party.

why, yes, he replied, i thought so.

impossible: i said. are you ignorant that for many years agathon has not
resided at athens; and not three have elapsed since i became acquainted
with socrates, and have made it my daily business to know all that he
says and does. there was a time when i was running about the world,
fancying myself to be well employed, but i was really a most wretched
being, no better than you are now. i thought that i ought to do anything
rather than be a philosopher.

well, he said, jesting apart, tell me when the meeting occurred.

in our boyhood, i replied, when agathon won the prize with his first
tragedy, on the day after that on which he and his chorus offered the
sacrifice of victory.

then it must have been a long while ago, he said; and who told you--did
socrates?

no indeed, i replied, but the same person who told phoenix;--he was a
little fellow, who never wore any shoes, aristodemus, of the deme of
cydathenaeum. he had been at agathon's feast; and i think that in
those days there was no one who was a more devoted admirer of socrates.
moreover, i have asked socrates about the truth of some parts of his
narrative, and he confirmed them. then, said glaucon, let us have the
tale over again; is not the road to athens just made for conversation?
and so we walked, and talked of the discourses on love; and therefore,
as i said at first, i am not ill-prepared to comply with your request,
and will have another rehearsal of them if you like. for to speak or to
hear others speak of philosophy always gives me the greatest pleasure,
to say nothing of the profit. but when i hear another strain, especially
that of you rich men and traders, such conversation displeases me; and
i pity you who are my companions, because you think that you are doing
something when in reality you are doing nothing. and i dare say that
you pity me in return, whom you regard as an unhappy creature, and very
probably you are right. but i certainly know of you what you only think
of me--there is the difference.

companion: i see, apollodorus, that you are just the same--always
speaking evil of yourself, and of others; and i do believe that you pity
all mankind, with the exception of socrates, yourself first of all, true
in this to your old name, which, however deserved, i know not how you
acquired, of apollodorus the madman; for you are always raging against
yourself and everybody but socrates.

apollodorus: yes, friend, and the reason why i am said to be mad, and
out of my wits, is just because i have these notions of myself and you;
no other evidence is required.

companion: no more of that, apollodorus; but let me renew my request
that you would repeat the conversation.

apollodorus: well, the tale of love was on this wise:--but perhaps i had
better begin at the beginning, and endeavour to give you the exact words
of aristodemus:

he said that he met socrates fresh from the bath and sandalled; and as
the sight of the sandals was unusual, he asked him whither he was going
that he had been converted into such a beau:--

to a banquet at agathon's, he replied, whose invitation to his sacrifice
of victory i refused yesterday, fearing a crowd, but promising that i
would come to-day instead; and so i have put on my finery, because he is
such a fine man. what say you to going with me unasked?

i will do as you bid me, i replied.

follow then, he said, and let us demolish the proverb:--

'to the feasts of inferior men the good unbidden go;'

instead of which our proverb will run:--

'to the feasts of the good the good unbidden go;'

and this alteration may be supported by the authority of homer himself,
who not only demolishes but literally outrages the proverb. for, after
picturing agamemnon as the most valiant of men, he makes menelaus, who
is but a fainthearted warrior, come unbidden (iliad) to the banquet of
agamemnon, who is feasting and offering sacrifices, not the better to
the worse, but the worse to the better.

i rather fear, socrates, said aristodemus, lest this may still be my
case; and that, like menelaus in homer, i shall be the inferior person,
who

'to the feasts of the wise unbidden goes.'

but i shall say that i was bidden of you, and then you will have to make
an excuse.

'two going together,'

he replied, in homeric fashion, one or other of them may invent an
excuse by the way (iliad).

this was the style of their conversation as they went along. socrates
dropped behind in a fit of abstraction, and desired aristodemus, who was
waiting, to go on before him. when he reached the house of agathon
he found the doors wide open, and a comical thing happened. a servant
coming out met him, and led him at once into the banqueting-hall in
which the guests were reclining, for the banquet was about to begin.
welcome, aristodemus, said agathon, as soon as he appeared--you are just
in time to sup with us; if you come on any other matter put it off, and
make one of us, as i was looking for you yesterday and meant to have
asked you, if i could have found you. but what have you done with
socrates?

i turned round, but socrates was nowhere to be seen; and i had to
explain that he had been with me a moment before, and that i came by his
invitation to the supper.

you were quite right in coming, said agathon; but where is he himself?

he was behind me just now, as i entered, he said, and i cannot think
what has become of him.

go and look for him, boy, said agathon, and bring him in; and do you,
aristodemus, meanwhile take the place by eryximachus.

the servant then assisted him to wash, and he lay down, and presently
another servant came in and reported that our friend socrates had
retired into the portico of the neighbouring house. 'there he is fixed,'
said he, 'and when i call to him he will not stir.'

how strange, said agathon; then you must call him again, and keep
calling him.

let him alone, said my informant; he has a way of stopping anywhere and
losing himself without any reason. i believe that he will soon appear;
do not therefore disturb him.

well, if you think so, i will leave him, said agathon. and then, turning
to the servants, he added, 'let us have supper without waiting for him.
serve up whatever you please, for there is no one to give you orders;
hitherto i have never left you to yourselves. but on this occasion
imagine that you are our hosts, and that i and the company are your
guests; treat us well, and then we shall commend you.' after this,
supper was served, but still no socrates; and during the meal agathon
several times expressed a wish to send for him, but aristodemus
objected; and at last when the feast was about half over--for the fit,
as usual, was not of long duration--socrates entered. agathon, who was
reclining alone at the end of the table, begged that he would take
the place next to him; that 'i may touch you,' he said, 'and have the
benefit of that wise thought which came into your mind in the portico,
and is now in your possession; for i am certain that you would not have
come away until you had found what you sought.'

how i wish, said socrates, taking his place as he was desired, that
wisdom could be infused by touch, out of the fuller into the emptier
man, as water runs through wool out of a fuller cup into an emptier one;
if that were so, how greatly should i value the privilege of reclining
at your side! for you would have filled me full with a stream of wisdom
plenteous and fair; whereas my own is of a very mean and questionable
sort, no better than a dream. but yours is bright and full of promise,
and was manifested forth in all the splendour of youth the day before
yesterday, in the presence of more than thirty thousand hellenes.

you are mocking, socrates, said agathon, and ere long you and i will
have to determine who bears off the palm of wisdom--of this dionysus
shall be the judge; but at present you are better occupied with supper.

socrates took his place on the couch, and supped with the rest; and then
libations were offered, and after a hymn had been sung to the god,
and there had been the usual ceremonies, they were about to commence
drinking, when pausanias said, and now, my friends, how can we drink
with least injury to ourselves? i can assure you that i feel severely
the effect of yesterday's potations, and must have time to recover; and
i suspect that most of you are in the same predicament, for you were
of the party yesterday. consider then: how can the drinking be made
easiest?

i entirely agree, said aristophanes, that we should, by all means, avoid
hard drinking, for i was myself one of those who were yesterday drowned
in drink.

i think that you are right, said eryximachus, the son of acumenus; but
i should still like to hear one other person speak: is agathon able to
drink hard?

i am not equal to it, said agathon.

then, said eryximachus, the weak heads like myself, aristodemus,
phaedrus, and others who never can drink, are fortunate in finding
that the stronger ones are not in a drinking mood. (i do not include
socrates, who is able either to drink or to abstain, and will not mind,
whichever we do.) well, as of none of the company seem disposed to drink
much, i may be forgiven for saying, as a physician, that drinking deep
is a bad practice, which i never follow, if i can help, and certainly
do not recommend to another, least of all to any one who still feels the
effects of yesterday's carouse.

i always do what you advise, and especially what you prescribe as a
physician, rejoined phaedrus the myrrhinusian, and the rest of the
company, if they are wise, will do the same.

it was agreed that drinking was not to be the order of the day, but that
they were all to drink only so much as they pleased.

then, said eryximachus, as you are all agreed that drinking is to be
voluntary, and that there is to be no compulsion, i move, in the next
place, that the flute-girl, who has just made her appearance, be told
to go away and play to herself, or, if she likes, to the women who are
within (compare prot.). to-day let us have conversation instead; and,
if you will allow me, i will tell you what sort of conversation. this
proposal having been accepted, eryximachus proceeded as follows:--

i will begin, he said, after the manner of melanippe in euripides,

'not mine the word'

which i am about to speak, but that of phaedrus. for often he says to me
in an indignant tone:--'what a strange thing it is, eryximachus, that,
whereas other gods have poems and hymns made in their honour, the great
and glorious god, love, has no encomiast among all the poets who are
so many. there are the worthy sophists too--the excellent prodicus for
example, who have descanted in prose on the virtues of heracles and
other heroes; and, what is still more extraordinary, i have met with a
philosophical work in which the utility of salt has been made the theme
of an eloquent discourse; and many other like things have had a like
honour bestowed upon them. and only to think that there should have been
an eager interest created about them, and yet that to this day no one
has ever dared worthily to hymn love's praises! so entirely has this
great deity been neglected.' now in this phaedrus seems to me to be
quite right, and therefore i want to offer him a contribution; also i
think that at the present moment we who are here assembled cannot do
better than honour the god love. if you agree with me, there will be
no lack of conversation; for i mean to propose that each of us in turn,
going from left to right, shall make a speech in honour of love. let him
give us the best which he can; and phaedrus, because he is sitting first
on the left hand, and because he is the father of the thought, shall
begin.

no one will vote against you, eryximachus, said socrates. how can i
oppose your motion, who profess to understand nothing but matters of
love; nor, i presume, will agathon and pausanias; and there can be
no doubt of aristophanes, whose whole concern is with dionysus and
aphrodite; nor will any one disagree of those whom i see around me. the
proposal, as i am aware, may seem rather hard upon us whose place is
last; but we shall be contented if we hear some good speeches first. let
phaedrus begin the praise of love, and good luck to him. all the company
expressed their assent, and desired him to do as socrates bade him.

aristodemus did not recollect all that was said, nor do i recollect all
that he related to me; but i will tell you what i thought most worthy of
remembrance, and what the chief speakers said.

phaedrus began by affirming that love is a mighty god, and wonderful
among gods and men, but especially wonderful in his birth. for he is the
eldest of the gods, which is an honour to him; and a proof of his claim
to this honour is, that of his parents there is no memorial; neither
poet nor prose-writer has ever affirmed that he had any. as hesiod
says:--

'first chaos came, and then broad-bosomed earth, the everlasting seat of
all that is, and love.'

in other words, after chaos, the earth and love, these two, came into
being. also parmenides sings of generation:

'first in the train of gods, he fashioned love.'

and acusilaus agrees with hesiod. thus numerous are the witnesses who
acknowledge love to be the eldest of the gods. and not only is he the
eldest, he is also the source of the greatest benefits to us. for i know
not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning life than a
virtuous lover, or to the lover than a beloved youth. for the principle
which ought to be the guide of men who would nobly live--that principle,
i say, neither kindred, nor honour, nor wealth, nor any other motive is
able to implant so well as love. of what am i speaking? of the sense of
honour and dishonour, without which neither states nor individuals ever
do any good or great work. and i say that a lover who is detected in
doing any dishonourable act, or submitting through cowardice when
any dishonour is done to him by another, will be more pained at being
detected by his beloved than at being seen by his father, or by his
companions, or by any one else. the beloved too, when he is found in
any disgraceful situation, has the same feeling about his lover. and if
there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be
made up of lovers and their loves (compare rep.), they would be the very
best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonour, and
emulating one another in honour; and when fighting at each other's side,
although a mere handful, they would overcome the world. for what lover
would not choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved,
either when abandoning his post or throwing away his arms? he would be
ready to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this. or who would
desert his beloved or fail him in the hour of danger? the veriest coward
would become an inspired hero, equal to the bravest, at such a time;
love would inspire him. that courage which, as homer says, the god
breathes into the souls of some heroes, love of his own nature infuses
into the lover.

love will make men dare to die for their beloved--love alone; and women
as well as men. of this, alcestis, the daughter of pelias, is a monument
to all hellas; for she was willing to lay down her life on behalf of her
husband, when no one else would, although he had a father and mother;
but the tenderness of her love so far exceeded theirs, that she made
them seem to be strangers in blood to their own son, and in name only
related to him; and so noble did this action of hers appear to the gods,
as well as to men, that among the many who have done virtuously she is
one of the very few to whom, in admiration of her noble action, they
have granted the privilege of returning alive to earth; such exceeding
honour is paid by the gods to the devotion and virtue of love. but
orpheus, the son of oeagrus, the harper, they sent empty away, and
presented to him an apparition only of her whom he sought, but herself
they would not give up, because he showed no spirit; he was only a
harp-player, and did not dare like alcestis to die for love, but was
contriving how he might enter hades alive; moreover, they afterwards
caused him to suffer death at the hands of women, as the punishment
of his cowardliness. very different was the reward of the true love of
achilles towards his lover patroclus--his lover and not his love (the
notion that patroclus was the beloved one is a foolish error into which
aeschylus has fallen, for achilles was surely the fairer of the two,
fairer also than all the other heroes; and, as homer informs us, he was
still beardless, and younger far). and greatly as the gods honour the
virtue of love, still the return of love on the part of the beloved to
the lover is more admired and valued and rewarded by them, for the lover
is more divine; because he is inspired by god. now achilles was quite
aware, for he had been told by his mother, that he might avoid death and
return home, and live to a good old age, if he abstained from slaying
hector. nevertheless he gave his life to revenge his friend, and dared
to die, not only in his defence, but after he was dead. wherefore the
gods honoured him even above alcestis, and sent him to the islands of
the blest. these are my reasons for affirming that love is the eldest
and noblest and mightiest of the gods; and the chiefest author and giver
of virtue in life, and of happiness after death.

this, or something like this, was the speech of phaedrus; and some other
speeches followed which aristodemus did not remember; the next which he
repeated was that of pausanias. phaedrus, he said, the argument has not
been set before us, i think, quite in the right form;--we should not be
called upon to praise love in such an indiscriminate manner. if there
were only one love, then what you said would be well enough; but since
there are more loves than one,--should have begun by determining which
of them was to be the theme of our praises. i will amend this defect;
and first of all i will tell you which love is deserving of praise, and
then try to hymn the praiseworthy one in a manner worthy of him. for we
all know that love is inseparable from aphrodite, and if there were
only one aphrodite there would be only one love; but as there are two
goddesses there must be two loves. and am i not right in asserting that
there are two goddesses? the elder one, having no mother, who is called
the heavenly aphrodite--she is the daughter of uranus; the younger, who
is the daughter of zeus and dione--her we call common; and the love
who is her fellow-worker is rightly named common, as the other love is
called heavenly. all the gods ought to have praise given to them, but
not without distinction of their natures; and therefore i must try to
distinguish the characters of the two loves. now actions vary according
to the manner of their performance. take, for example, that which we
are now doing, drinking, singing and talking--these actions are not in
themselves either good or evil, but they turn out in this or that way
according to the mode of performing them; and when well done they are
good, and when wrongly done they are evil; and in like manner not every
love, but only that which has a noble purpose, is noble and worthy
of praise. the love who is the offspring of the common aphrodite is
essentially common, and has no discrimination, being such as the meaner
sort of men feel, and is apt to be of women as well as of youths, and
is of the body rather than of the soul--the most foolish beings are the
objects of this love which desires only to gain an end, but never thinks
of accomplishing the end nobly, and therefore does good and evil quite
indiscriminately. the goddess who is his mother is far younger than
the other, and she was born of the union of the male and female, and
partakes of both. but the offspring of the heavenly aphrodite is derived
from a mother in whose birth the female has no part,--she is from the
male only; this is that love which is of youths, and the goddess being
older, there is nothing of wantonness in her. those who are inspired by
this love turn to the male, and delight in him who is the more valiant
and intelligent nature; any one may recognise the pure enthusiasts in
the very character of their attachments. for they love not boys, but
intelligent beings whose reason is beginning to be developed, much about
the time at which their beards begin to grow. and in choosing young men
to be their companions, they mean to be faithful to them, and pass their
whole life in company with them, not to take them in their inexperience,
and deceive them, and play the fool with them, or run away from one to
another of them. but the love of young boys should be forbidden by law,
because their future is uncertain; they may turn out good or bad, either
in body or soul, and much noble enthusiasm may be thrown away upon them;
in this matter the good are a law to themselves, and the coarser sort
of lovers ought to be restrained by force; as we restrain or attempt to
restrain them from fixing their affections on women of free birth. these
are the persons who bring a reproach on love; and some have been led to
deny the lawfulness of such attachments because they see the impropriety
and evil of them; for surely nothing that is decorously and lawfully
done can justly be censured. now here and in lacedaemon the rules about
love are perplexing, but in most cities they are simple and easily
intelligible; in elis and boeotia, and in countries having no gifts of
eloquence, they are very straightforward; the law is simply in favour of
these connexions, and no one, whether young or old, has anything to say
to their discredit; the reason being, as i suppose, that they are men
of few words in those parts, and therefore the lovers do not like the
trouble of pleading their suit. in ionia and other places, and generally
in countries which are subject to the barbarians, the custom is held
to be dishonourable; loves of youths share the evil repute in which
philosophy and gymnastics are held, because they are inimical to
tyranny; for the interests of rulers require that their subjects should
be poor in spirit (compare arist. politics), and that there should be no
strong bond of friendship or society among them, which love, above all
other motives, is likely to inspire, as our athenian tyrants learned by
experience; for the love of aristogeiton and the constancy of harmodius
had a strength which undid their power. and, therefore, the ill-repute
into which these attachments have fallen is to be ascribed to the evil
condition of those who make them to be ill-reputed; that is to say, to
the self-seeking of the governors and the cowardice of the governed; on
the other hand, the indiscriminate honour which is given to them in some
countries is attributable to the laziness of those who hold this opinion
of them. in our own country a far better principle prevails, but, as
i was saying, the explanation of it is rather perplexing. for, observe
that open loves are held to be more honourable than secret ones, and
that the love of the noblest and highest, even if their persons are
less beautiful than others, is especially honourable. consider, too,
how great is the encouragement which all the world gives to the lover;
neither is he supposed to be doing anything dishonourable; but if he
succeeds he is praised, and if he fail he is blamed. and in the pursuit
of his love the custom of mankind allows him to do many strange things,
which philosophy would bitterly censure if they were done from any
motive of interest, or wish for office or power. he may pray, and
entreat, and supplicate, and swear, and lie on a mat at the door, and
endure a slavery worse than that of any slave--in any other case friends
and enemies would be equally ready to prevent him, but now there is no
friend who will be ashamed of him and admonish him, and no enemy will
charge him with meanness or flattery; the actions of a lover have a
grace which ennobles them; and custom has decided that they are highly
commendable and that there no loss of character in them; and, what is
strangest of all, he only may swear and forswear himself (so men say),
and the gods will forgive his transgression, for there is no such thing
as a lover's oath. such is the entire liberty which gods and men have
allowed the lover, according to the custom which prevails in our part of
the world. from this point of view a man fairly argues that in athens
to love and to be loved is held to be a very honourable thing. but when
parents forbid their sons to talk with their lovers, and place them
under a tutor's care, who is appointed to see to these things, and their
companions and equals cast in their teeth anything of the sort which
they may observe, and their elders refuse to silence the reprovers
and do not rebuke them--any one who reflects on all this will, on the
contrary, think that we hold these practices to be most disgraceful.
but, as i was saying at first, the truth as i imagine is, that whether
such practices are honourable or whether they are dishonourable is not a
simple question; they are honourable to him who follows them honourably,
dishonourable to him who follows them dishonourably. there is dishonour
in yielding to the evil, or in an evil manner; but there is honour in
yielding to the good, or in an honourable manner. evil is the vulgar
lover who loves the body rather than the soul, inasmuch as he is not
even stable, because he loves a thing which is in itself unstable, and
therefore when the bloom of youth which he was desiring is over, he
takes wing and flies away, in spite of all his words and promises;
whereas the love of the noble disposition is life-long, for it becomes
one with the everlasting. the custom of our country would have both of
them proven well and truly, and would have us yield to the one sort of
lover and avoid the other, and therefore encourages some to pursue,
and others to fly; testing both the lover and beloved in contests and
trials, until they show to which of the two classes they respectively
belong. and this is the reason why, in the first place, a hasty
attachment is held to be dishonourable, because time is the true test of
this as of most other things; and secondly there is a dishonour in being
overcome by the love of money, or of wealth, or of political power,
whether a man is frightened into surrender by the loss of them, or,
having experienced the benefits of money and political corruption, is
unable to rise above the seductions of them. for none of these things
are of a permanent or lasting nature; not to mention that no generous
friendship ever sprang from them. there remains, then, only one way of
honourable attachment which custom allows in the beloved, and this is
the way of virtue; for as we admitted that any service which the lover
does to him is not to be accounted flattery or a dishonour to himself,
so the beloved has one way only of voluntary service which is not
dishonourable, and this is virtuous service.

for we have a custom, and according to our custom any one who does
service to another under the idea that he will be improved by him either
in wisdom, or in some other particular of virtue--such a voluntary
service, i say, is not to be regarded as a dishonour, and is not open
to the charge of flattery. and these two customs, one the love of youth,
and the other the practice of philosophy and virtue in general, ought to
meet in one, and then the beloved may honourably indulge the lover. for
when the lover and beloved come together, having each of them a law, and
the lover thinks that he is right in doing any service which he can to
his gracious loving one; and the other that he is right in showing any
kindness which he can to him who is making him wise and good; the one
capable of communicating wisdom and virtue, the other seeking to acquire
them with a view to education and wisdom, when the two laws of love are
fulfilled and meet in one--then, and then only, may the beloved yield
with honour to the lover. nor when love is of this disinterested sort is
there any disgrace in being deceived, but in every other case there is
equal disgrace in being or not being deceived. for he who is gracious to
his lover under the impression that he is rich, and is disappointed of
his gains because he turns out to be poor, is disgraced all the same:
for he has done his best to show that he would give himself up to any
one's 'uses base' for the sake of money; but this is not honourable. and
on the same principle he who gives himself to a lover because he is a
good man, and in the hope that he will be improved by his company, shows
himself to be virtuous, even though the object of his affection turn
out to be a villain, and to have no virtue; and if he is deceived he has
committed a noble error. for he has proved that for his part he will do
anything for anybody with a view to virtue and improvement, than which
there can be nothing nobler. thus noble in every case is the acceptance
of another for the sake of virtue. this is that love which is the
love of the heavenly godess, and is heavenly, and of great price to
individuals and cities, making the lover and the beloved alike eager in
the work of their own improvement. but all other loves are the offspring
of the other, who is the common goddess. to you, phaedrus, i offer this
my contribution in praise of love, which is as good as i could make
extempore.

pausanias came to a pause--this is the balanced way in which i have
been taught by the wise to speak; and aristodemus said that the turn of
aristophanes was next, but either he had eaten too much, or from some
other cause he had the hiccough, and was obliged to change turns with
eryximachus the physician, who was reclining on the couch below him.
eryximachus, he said, you ought either to stop my hiccough, or to speak
in my turn until i have left off.

i will do both, said eryximachus: i will speak in your turn, and do you
speak in mine; and while i am speaking let me recommend you to hold your
breath, and if after you have done so for some time the hiccough is
no better, then gargle with a little water; and if it still continues,
tickle your nose with something and sneeze; and if you sneeze once or
twice, even the most violent hiccough is sure to go. i will do as you
prescribe, said aristophanes, and now get on.

eryximachus spoke as follows: seeing that pausanias made a fair
beginning, and but a lame ending, i must endeavour to supply his
deficiency. i think that he has rightly distinguished two kinds of love.
but my art further informs me that the double love is not merely an
affection of the soul of man towards the fair, or towards anything, but
is to be found in the bodies of all animals and in productions of the
earth, and i may say in all that is; such is the conclusion which i seem
to have gathered from my own art of medicine, whence i learn how great
and wonderful and universal is the deity of love, whose empire extends
over all things, divine as well as human. and from medicine i will begin
that i may do honour to my art. there are in the human body these two
kinds of love, which are confessedly different and unlike, and being
unlike, they have loves and desires which are unlike; and the desire of
the healthy is one, and the desire of the diseased is another; and as
pausanias was just now saying that to indulge good men is honourable,
and bad men dishonourable:--so too in the body the good and healthy
elements are to be indulged, and the bad elements and the elements of
disease are not to be indulged, but discouraged. and this is what the
physician has to do, and in this the art of medicine consists: for
medicine may be regarded generally as the knowledge of the loves and
desires of the body, and how to satisfy them or not; and the best
physician is he who is able to separate fair love from foul, or to
convert one into the other; and he who knows how to eradicate and how to
implant love, whichever is required, and can reconcile the most hostile
elements in the constitution and make them loving friends, is a skilful
practitioner. now the most hostile are the most opposite, such as
hot and cold, bitter and sweet, moist and dry, and the like. and my
ancestor, asclepius, knowing how to implant friendship and accord in
these elements, was the creator of our art, as our friends the poets
here tell us, and i believe them; and not only medicine in every branch
but the arts of gymnastic and husbandry are under his dominion. any one
who pays the least attention to the subject will also perceive that in
music there is the same reconciliation of opposites; and i suppose that
this must have been the meaning of heracleitus, although his words are
not accurate; for he says that the one is united by disunion, like the
harmony of the bow and the lyre. now there is an absurdity saying that
harmony is discord or is composed of elements which are still in a state
of discord. but what he probably meant was, that harmony is composed of
differing notes of higher or lower pitch which disagreed once, but are
now reconciled by the art of music; for if the higher and lower notes
still disagreed, there could be no harmony,--clearly not. for harmony
is a symphony, and symphony is an agreement; but an agreement of
disagreements while they disagree there cannot be; you cannot harmonize
that which disagrees. in like manner rhythm is compounded of elements
short and long, once differing and now in accord; which accordance, as
in the former instance, medicine, so in all these other cases, music
implants, making love and unison to grow up among them; and thus music,
too, is concerned with the principles of love in their application to
harmony and rhythm. again, in the essential nature of harmony and rhythm
there is no difficulty in discerning love which has not yet become
double. but when you want to use them in actual life, either in the
composition of songs or in the correct performance of airs or metres
composed already, which latter is called education, then the difficulty
begins, and the good artist is needed. then the old tale has to be
repeated of fair and heavenly love--the love of urania the fair and
heavenly muse, and of the duty of accepting the temperate, and those
who are as yet intemperate only that they may become temperate, and of
preserving their love; and again, of the vulgar polyhymnia, who must
be used with circumspection that the pleasure be enjoyed, but may not
generate licentiousness; just as in my own art it is a great matter so
to regulate the desires of the epicure that he may gratify his tastes
without the attendant evil of disease. whence i infer that in music, in
medicine, in all other things human as well as divine, both loves ought
to be noted as far as may be, for they are both present.

the course of the seasons is also full of both these principles; and
when, as i was saying, the elements of hot and cold, moist and dry,
attain the harmonious love of one another and blend in temperance and
harmony, they bring to men, animals, and plants health and plenty, and
do them no harm; whereas the wanton love, getting the upper hand and
affecting the seasons of the year, is very destructive and injurious,
being the source of pestilence, and bringing many other kinds of
diseases on animals and plants; for hoar-frost and hail and blight
spring from the excesses and disorders of these elements of love, which
to know in relation to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies and the
seasons of the year is termed astronomy. furthermore all sacrifices and
the whole province of divination, which is the art of communion between
gods and men--these, i say, are concerned only with the preservation
of the good and the cure of the evil love. for all manner of impiety is
likely to ensue if, instead of accepting and honouring and reverencing
the harmonious love in all his actions, a man honours the other love,
whether in his feelings towards gods or parents, towards the living or
the dead. wherefore the business of divination is to see to these loves
and to heal them, and divination is the peacemaker of gods and men,
working by a knowledge of the religious or irreligious tendencies which
exist in human loves. such is the great and mighty, or rather omnipotent
force of love in general. and the love, more especially, which is
concerned with the good, and which is perfected in company with
temperance and justice, whether among gods or men, has the greatest
power, and is the source of all our happiness and harmony, and makes us
friends with the gods who are above us, and with one another. i dare say
that i too have omitted several things which might be said in praise
of love, but this was not intentional, and you, aristophanes, may now
supply the omission or take some other line of commendation; for i
perceive that you are rid of the hiccough.

yes, said aristophanes, who followed, the hiccough is gone; not,
however, until i applied the sneezing; and i wonder whether the harmony
of the body has a love of such noises and ticklings, for i no sooner
applied the sneezing than i was cured.

eryximachus said: beware, friend aristophanes, although you are going
to speak, you are making fun of me; and i shall have to watch and see
whether i cannot have a laugh at your expense, when you might speak in
peace.

you are right, said aristophanes, laughing. i will unsay my words; but
do you please not to watch me, as i fear that in the speech which i
am about to make, instead of others laughing with me, which is to the
manner born of our muse and would be all the better, i shall only be
laughed at by them.

do you expect to shoot your bolt and escape, aristophanes? well, perhaps
if you are very careful and bear in mind that you will be called to
account, i may be induced to let you off.

aristophanes professed to open another vein of discourse; he had a
mind to praise love in another way, unlike that either of pausanias or
eryximachus. mankind, he said, judging by their neglect of him, have
never, as i think, at all understood the power of love. for if they had
understood him they would surely have built noble temples and altars,
and offered solemn sacrifices in his honour; but this is not done, and
most certainly ought to be done: since of all the gods he is the best
friend of men, the helper and the healer of the ills which are the great
impediment to the happiness of the race. i will try to describe his
power to you, and you shall teach the rest of the world what i am
teaching you. in the first place, let me treat of the nature of man and
what has happened to it; for the original human nature was not like
the present, but different. the sexes were not two as they are now, but
originally three in number; there was man, woman, and the union of the
two, having a name corresponding to this double nature, which had once
a real existence, but is now lost, and the word 'androgynous' is only
preserved as a term of reproach. in the second place, the primeval man
was round, his back and sides forming a circle; and he had four hands
and four feet, one head with two faces, looking opposite ways, set on a
round neck and precisely alike; also four ears, two privy members,
and the remainder to correspond. he could walk upright as men now do,
backwards or forwards as he pleased, and he could also roll over and
over at a great pace, turning on his four hands and four feet, eight in
all, like tumblers going over and over with their legs in the air; this
was when he wanted to run fast. now the sexes were three, and such as i
have described them; because the sun, moon, and earth are three; and the
man was originally the child of the sun, the woman of the earth, and the
man-woman of the moon, which is made up of sun and earth, and they were
all round and moved round and round like their parents. terrible was
their might and strength, and the thoughts of their hearts were great,
and they made an attack upon the gods; of them is told the tale of otys
and ephialtes who, as homer says, dared to scale heaven, and would
have laid hands upon the gods. doubt reigned in the celestial councils.
should they kill them and annihilate the race with thunderbolts, as they
had done the giants, then there would be an end of the sacrifices and
worship which men offered to them; but, on the other hand, the gods
could not suffer their insolence to be unrestrained. at last, after a
good deal of reflection, zeus discovered a way. he said: 'methinks i
have a plan which will humble their pride and improve their manners; men
shall continue to exist, but i will cut them in two and then they will
be diminished in strength and increased in numbers; this will have the
advantage of making them more profitable to us. they shall walk upright
on two legs, and if they continue insolent and will not be quiet, i will
split them again and they shall hop about on a single leg.' he spoke and
cut men in two, like a sorb-apple which is halved for pickling, or
as you might divide an egg with a hair; and as he cut them one after
another, he bade apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn
in order that the man might contemplate the section of himself: he would
thus learn a lesson of humility. apollo was also bidden to heal their
wounds and compose their forms. so he gave a turn to the face and pulled
the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called
the belly, like the purses which draw in, and he made one mouth at
the centre, which he fastened in a knot (the same which is called the
navel); he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles,
much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last; he left a few,
however, in the region of the belly and navel, as a memorial of the
primeval state. after the division the two parts of man, each desiring
his other half, came together, and throwing their arms about one
another, entwined in mutual embraces, longing to grow into one, they
were on the point of dying from hunger and self-neglect, because they
did not like to do anything apart; and when one of the halves died and
the other survived, the survivor sought another mate, man or woman as
we call them,--being the sections of entire men or women,--and clung to
that. they were being destroyed, when zeus in pity of them invented a
new plan: he turned the parts of generation round to the front, for this
had not been always their position, and they sowed the seed no longer as
hitherto like grasshoppers in the ground, but in one another; and after
the transposition the male generated in the female in order that by the
mutual embraces of man and woman they might breed, and the race might
continue; or if man came to man they might be satisfied, and rest, and
go their ways to the business of life: so ancient is the desire of one
another which is implanted in us, reuniting our original nature, making
one of two, and healing the state of man. each of us when separated,
having one side only, like a flat fish, is but the indenture of a man,
and he is always looking for his other half. men who are a section
of that double nature which was once called androgynous are lovers of
women; adulterers are generally of this breed, and also adulterous women
who lust after men: the women who are a section of the woman do not care
for men, but have female attachments; the female companions are of this
sort. but they who are a section of the male follow the male, and while
they are young, being slices of the original man, they hang about men
and embrace them, and they are themselves the best of boys and youths,
because they have the most manly nature. some indeed assert that they
are shameless, but this is not true; for they do not act thus from any
want of shame, but because they are valiant and manly, and have a manly
countenance, and they embrace that which is like them. and these when
they grow up become our statesmen, and these only, which is a great
proof of the truth of what i am saving. when they reach manhood they
are lovers of youth, and are not naturally inclined to marry or beget
children,--if at all, they do so only in obedience to the law; but they
are satisfied if they may be allowed to live with one another unwedded;
and such a nature is prone to love and ready to return love, always
embracing that which is akin to him. and when one of them meets with his
other half, the actual half of himself, whether he be a lover of youth
or a lover of another sort, the pair are lost in an amazement of love
and friendship and intimacy, and one will not be out of the other's
sight, as i may say, even for a moment: these are the people who pass
their whole lives together; yet they could not explain what they desire
of one another. for the intense yearning which each of them has towards
the other does not appear to be the desire of lover's intercourse, but
of something else which the soul of either evidently desires and cannot
tell, and of which she has only a dark and doubtful presentiment.
suppose hephaestus, with his instruments, to come to the pair who are
lying side by side and to say to them, 'what do you people want of one
another?' they would be unable to explain. and suppose further, that
when he saw their perplexity he said: 'do you desire to be wholly one;
always day and night to be in one another's company? for if this is what
you desire, i am ready to melt you into one and let you grow together,
so that being two you shall become one, and while you live live a common
life as if you were a single man, and after your death in the world
below still be one departed soul instead of two--i ask whether this
is what you lovingly desire, and whether you are satisfied to attain
this?'--there is not a man of them who when he heard the proposal would
deny or would not acknowledge that this meeting and melting into one
another, this becoming one instead of two, was the very expression of
his ancient need (compare arist. pol.). and the reason is that human
nature was originally one and we were a whole, and the desire and
pursuit of the whole is called love. there was a time, i say, when we
were one, but now because of the wickedness of mankind god has dispersed
us, as the arcadians were dispersed into villages by the lacedaemonians
(compare arist. pol.). and if we are not obedient to the gods, there is
a danger that we shall be split up again and go about in basso-relievo,
like the profile figures having only half a nose which are sculptured
on monuments, and that we shall be like tallies. wherefore let us exhort
all men to piety, that we may avoid evil, and obtain the good, of which
love is to us the lord and minister; and let no one oppose him--he is
the enemy of the gods who opposes him. for if we are friends of the god
and at peace with him we shall find our own true loves, which rarely
happens in this world at present. i am serious, and therefore i must beg
eryximachus not to make fun or to find any allusion in what i am saying
to pausanias and agathon, who, as i suspect, are both of the manly
nature, and belong to the class which i have been describing. but my
words have a wider application--they include men and women everywhere;
and i believe that if our loves were perfectly accomplished, and each
one returning to his primeval nature had his original true love, then
our race would be happy. and if this would be best of all, the best
in the next degree and under present circumstances must be the nearest
approach to such an union; and that will be the attainment of a
congenial love. wherefore, if we would praise him who has given to
us the benefit, we must praise the god love, who is our greatest
benefactor, both leading us in this life back to our own nature, and
giving us high hopes for the future, for he promises that if we are
pious, he will restore us to our original state, and heal us and make
us happy and blessed. this, eryximachus, is my discourse of love, which,
although different to yours, i must beg you to leave unassailed by the
shafts of your ridicule, in order that each may have his turn; each, or
rather either, for agathon and socrates are the only ones left.

indeed, i am not going to attack you, said eryximachus, for i thought
your speech charming, and did i not know that agathon and socrates are
masters in the art of love, i should be really afraid that they would
have nothing to say, after the world of things which have been said
already. but, for all that, i am not without hopes.

socrates said: you played your part well, eryximachus; but if you were
as i am now, or rather as i shall be when agathon has spoken, you would,
indeed, be in a great strait.

you want to cast a spell over me, socrates, said agathon, in the hope
that i may be disconcerted at the expectation raised among the audience
that i shall speak well.

i should be strangely forgetful, agathon replied socrates, of the
courage and magnanimity which you showed when your own compositions were
about to be exhibited, and you came upon the stage with the actors and
faced the vast theatre altogether undismayed, if i thought that your
nerves could be fluttered at a small party of friends.

do you think, socrates, said agathon, that my head is so full of the
theatre as not to know how much more formidable to a man of sense a few
good judges are than many fools?

nay, replied socrates, i should be very wrong in attributing to you,
agathon, that or any other want of refinement. and i am quite aware that
if you happened to meet with any whom you thought wise, you would care
for their opinion much more than for that of the many. but then we,
having been a part of the foolish many in the theatre, cannot be
regarded as the select wise; though i know that if you chanced to be in
the presence, not of one of ourselves, but of some really wise man, you
would be ashamed of disgracing yourself before him--would you not?

yes, said agathon.

but before the many you would not be ashamed, if you thought that you
were doing something disgraceful in their presence?

here phaedrus interrupted them, saying: not answer him, my dear agathon;
for if he can only get a partner with whom he can talk, especially a
good-looking one, he will no longer care about the completion of our
plan. now i love to hear him talk; but just at present i must not forget
the encomium on love which i ought to receive from him and from every
one. when you and he have paid your tribute to the god, then you may
talk.

very good, phaedrus, said agathon; i see no reason why i should not
proceed with my speech, as i shall have many other opportunities of
conversing with socrates. let me say first how i ought to speak, and
then speak:--

the previous speakers, instead of praising the god love, or unfolding
his nature, appear to have congratulated mankind on the benefits which
he confers upon them. but i would rather praise the god first, and then
speak of his gifts; this is always the right way of praising everything.
may i say without impiety or offence, that of all the blessed gods he
is the most blessed because he is the fairest and best? and he is the
fairest: for, in the first place, he is the youngest, and of his youth
he is himself the witness, fleeing out of the way of age, who is swift
enough, swifter truly than most of us like:--love hates him and will not
come near him; but youth and love live and move together--like to like,
as the proverb says. many things were said by phaedrus about love in
which i agree with him; but i cannot agree that he is older than iapetus
and kronos:--not so; i maintain him to be the youngest of the gods, and
youthful ever. the ancient doings among the gods of which hesiod
and parmenides spoke, if the tradition of them be true, were done of
necessity and not of love; had love been in those days, there would have
been no chaining or mutilation of the gods, or other violence, but peace
and sweetness, as there is now in heaven, since the rule of love began.
love is young and also tender; he ought to have a poet like homer to
describe his tenderness, as homer says of ate, that she is a goddess and
tender:--

'her feet are tender, for she sets her steps, not on the ground but on
the heads of men:'

herein is an excellent proof of her tenderness,--that she walks not
upon the hard but upon the soft. let us adduce a similar proof of the
tenderness of love; for he walks not upon the earth, nor yet upon the
skulls of men, which are not so very soft, but in the hearts and souls
of both gods and men, which are of all things the softest: in them
he walks and dwells and makes his home. not in every soul without
exception, for where there is hardness he departs, where there is
softness there he dwells; and nestling always with his feet and in all
manner of ways in the softest of soft places, how can he be other than
the softest of all things? of a truth he is the tenderest as well as
the youngest, and also he is of flexile form; for if he were hard and
without flexure he could not enfold all things, or wind his way into and
out of every soul of man undiscovered. and a proof of his flexibility
and symmetry of form is his grace, which is universally admitted to be
in an especial manner the attribute of love; ungrace and love are always
at war with one another. the fairness of his complexion is revealed by
his habitation among the flowers; for he dwells not amid bloomless or
fading beauties, whether of body or soul or aught else, but in the place
of flowers and scents, there he sits and abides. concerning the beauty
of the god i have said enough; and yet there remains much more which i
might say. of his virtue i have now to speak: his greatest glory is that
he can neither do nor suffer wrong to or from any god or any man; for
he suffers not by force if he suffers; force comes not near him, neither
when he acts does he act by force. for all men in all things serve him
of their own free will, and where there is voluntary agreement, there,
as the laws which are the lords of the city say, is justice. and
not only is he just but exceedingly temperate, for temperance is the
acknowledged ruler of the pleasures and desires, and no pleasure ever
masters love; he is their master and they are his servants; and if he
conquers them he must be temperate indeed. as to courage, even the god
of war is no match for him; he is the captive and love is the lord,
for love, the love of aphrodite, masters him, as the tale runs; and the
master is stronger than the servant. and if he conquers the bravest of
all others, he must be himself the bravest. of his courage and justice
and temperance i have spoken, but i have yet to speak of his wisdom; and
according to the measure of my ability i must try to do my best. in the
first place he is a poet (and here, like eryximachus, i magnify my art),
and he is also the source of poesy in others, which he could not be if
he were not himself a poet. and at the touch of him every one becomes
a poet, even though he had no music in him before (a fragment of the
sthenoaoea of euripides.); this also is a proof that love is a good poet
and accomplished in all the fine arts; for no one can give to another
that which he has not himself, or teach that of which he has no
knowledge. who will deny that the creation of the animals is his doing?
are they not all the works of his wisdom, born and begotten of him?
and as to the artists, do we not know that he only of them whom love
inspires has the light of fame?--he whom love touches not walks
in darkness. the arts of medicine and archery and divination were
discovered by apollo, under the guidance of love and desire; so that he
too is a disciple of love. also the melody of the muses, the metallurgy
of hephaestus, the weaving of athene, the empire of zeus over gods and
men, are all due to love, who was the inventor of them. and so love set
in order the empire of the gods--the love of beauty, as is evident, for
with deformity love has no concern. in the days of old, as i began by
saying, dreadful deeds were done among the gods, for they were ruled
by necessity; but now since the birth of love, and from the love of
the beautiful, has sprung every good in heaven and earth. therefore,
phaedrus, i say of love that he is the fairest and best in himself, and
the cause of what is fairest and best in all other things. and there
comes into my mind a line of poetry in which he is said to be the god
who

'gives peace on earth and calms the stormy deep, who stills the winds
and bids the sufferer sleep.'

this is he who empties men of disaffection and fills them with
affection, who makes them to meet together at banquets such as these: in
sacrifices, feasts, dances, he is our lord--who sends courtesy and sends
away discourtesy, who gives kindness ever and never gives unkindness;
the friend of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the
gods; desired by those who have no part in him, and precious to those
who have the better part in him; parent of delicacy, luxury, desire,
fondness, softness, grace; regardful of the good, regardless of the
evil: in every word, work, wish, fear--saviour, pilot, comrade, helper;
glory of gods and men, leader best and brightest: in whose footsteps
let every man follow, sweetly singing in his honour and joining in that
sweet strain with which love charms the souls of gods and men. such
is the speech, phaedrus, half-playful, yet having a certain measure of
seriousness, which, according to my ability, i dedicate to the god.

when agathon had done speaking, aristodemus said that there was a
general cheer; the young man was thought to have spoken in a manner
worthy of himself, and of the god. and socrates, looking at eryximachus,
said: tell me, son of acumenus, was there not reason in my fears? and
was i not a true prophet when i said that agathon would make a wonderful
oration, and that i should be in a strait?

the part of the prophecy which concerns agathon, replied eryximachus,
appears to me to be true; but not the other part--that you will be in a
strait.

why, my dear friend, said socrates, must not i or any one be in a strait
who has to speak after he has heard such a rich and varied discourse? i
am especially struck with the beauty of the concluding words--who could
listen to them without amazement? when i reflected on the immeasurable
inferiority of my own powers, i was ready to run away for shame, if
there had been a possibility of escape. for i was reminded of gorgias,
and at the end of his speech i fancied that agathon was shaking at me
the gorginian or gorgonian head of the great master of rhetoric, which
was simply to turn me and my speech into stone, as homer says (odyssey),
and strike me dumb. and then i perceived how foolish i had been in
consenting to take my turn with you in praising love, and saying that
i too was a master of the art, when i really had no conception how
anything ought to be praised. for in my simplicity i imagined that the
topics of praise should be true, and that this being presupposed, out
of the true the speaker was to choose the best and set them forth in the
best manner. and i felt quite proud, thinking that i knew the nature of
true praise, and should speak well. whereas i now see that the intention
was to attribute to love every species of greatness and glory,
whether really belonging to him or not, without regard to truth or
falsehood--that was no matter; for the original proposal seems to have
been not that each of you should really praise love, but only that
you should appear to praise him. and so you attribute to love every
imaginable form of praise which can be gathered anywhere; and you say
that 'he is all this,' and 'the cause of all that,' making him appear
the fairest and best of all to those who know him not, for you cannot
impose upon those who know him. and a noble and solemn hymn of praise
have you rehearsed. but as i misunderstood the nature of the praise when
i said that i would take my turn, i must beg to be absolved from the
promise which i made in ignorance, and which (as euripides would say
(eurip. hyppolytus)) was a promise of the lips and not of the mind.
farewell then to such a strain: for i do not praise in that way; no,
indeed, i cannot. but if you like to hear the truth about love, i
am ready to speak in my own manner, though i will not make myself
ridiculous by entering into any rivalry with you. say then, phaedrus,
whether you would like to have the truth about love, spoken in any words
and in any order which may happen to come into my mind at the time. will
that be agreeable to you?

aristodemus said that phaedrus and the company bid him speak in
any manner which he thought best. then, he added, let me have your
permission first to ask agathon a few more questions, in order that i
may take his admissions as the premisses of my discourse.

i grant the permission, said phaedrus: put your questions. socrates then
proceeded as follows:--

in the magnificent oration which you have just uttered, i think that you
were right, my dear agathon, in proposing to speak of the nature of love
first and afterwards of his works--that is a way of beginning which i
very much approve. and as you have spoken so eloquently of his nature,
may i ask you further, whether love is the love of something or of
nothing? and here i must explain myself: i do not want you to say that
love is the love of a father or the love of a mother--that would be
ridiculous; but to answer as you would, if i asked is a father a father
of something? to which you would find no difficulty in replying, of a
son or daughter: and the answer would be right.

very true, said agathon.

and you would say the same of a mother?

he assented.

yet let me ask you one more question in order to illustrate my meaning:
is not a brother to be regarded essentially as a brother of something?

certainly, he replied.

that is, of a brother or sister?

yes, he said.

and now, said socrates, i will ask about love:--is love of something or
of nothing?

of something, surely, he replied.

keep in mind what this is, and tell me what i want to know--whether love
desires that of which love is.

yes, surely.

and does he possess, or does he not possess, that which he loves and
desires?

probably not, i should say.

nay, replied socrates, i would have you consider whether 'necessarily'
is not rather the word. the inference that he who desires something
is in want of something, and that he who desires nothing is in want of
nothing, is in my judgment, agathon, absolutely and necessarily true.
what do you think?

i agree with you, said agathon.

very good. would he who is great, desire to be great, or he who is
strong, desire to be strong?

that would be inconsistent with our previous admissions.

true. for he who is anything cannot want to be that which he is?

very true.

and yet, added socrates, if a man being strong desired to be strong, or
being swift desired to be swift, or being healthy desired to be healthy,
in that case he might be thought to desire something which he already
has or is. i give the example in order that we may avoid misconception.
for the possessors of these qualities, agathon, must be supposed to have
their respective advantages at the time, whether they choose or not; and
who can desire that which he has? therefore, when a person says, i am
well and wish to be well, or i am rich and wish to be rich, and i desire
simply to have what i have--to him we shall reply: 'you, my friend,
having wealth and health and strength, want to have the continuance of
them; for at this moment, whether you choose or no, you have them. and
when you say, i desire that which i have and nothing else, is not your
meaning that you want to have what you now have in the future?' he must
agree with us--must he not?

he must, replied agathon.

then, said socrates, he desires that what he has at present may be
preserved to him in the future, which is equivalent to saying that he
desires something which is non-existent to him, and which as yet he has
not got:

very true, he said.

then he and every one who desires, desires that which he has not
already, and which is future and not present, and which he has not, and
is not, and of which he is in want;--these are the sort of things which
love and desire seek?

very true, he said.

then now, said socrates, let us recapitulate the argument. first, is not
love of something, and of something too which is wanting to a man?

yes, he replied.

remember further what you said in your speech, or if you do not remember
i will remind you: you said that the love of the beautiful set in
order the empire of the gods, for that of deformed things there is no
love--did you not say something of that kind?

yes, said agathon.

yes, my friend, and the remark was a just one. and if this is true, love
is the love of beauty and not of deformity?

he assented.

and the admission has been already made that love is of something which
a man wants and has not?

true, he said.

then love wants and has not beauty?

certainly, he replied.

and would you call that beautiful which wants and does not possess
beauty?

certainly not.

then would you still say that love is beautiful?

agathon replied: i fear that i did not understand what i was saying.

you made a very good speech, agathon, replied socrates; but there is
yet one small question which i would fain ask:--is not the good also the
beautiful?

yes.

then in wanting the beautiful, love wants also the good?

i cannot refute you, socrates, said agathon:--let us assume that what
you say is true.

say rather, beloved agathon, that you cannot refute the truth; for
socrates is easily refuted.

and now, taking my leave of you, i would rehearse a tale of love which i
heard from diotima of mantineia (compare 1 alcibiades), a woman wise in
this and in many other kinds of knowledge, who in the days of old, when
the athenians offered sacrifice before the coming of the plague, delayed
the disease ten years. she was my instructress in the art of love, and
i shall repeat to you what she said to me, beginning with the admissions
made by agathon, which are nearly if not quite the same which i made
to the wise woman when she questioned me: i think that this will be
the easiest way, and i shall take both parts myself as well as i can
(compare gorgias). as you, agathon, suggested (supra), i must speak
first of the being and nature of love, and then of his works. first i
said to her in nearly the same words which he used to me, that love was
a mighty god, and likewise fair; and she proved to me as i proved to him
that, by my own showing, love was neither fair nor good. 'what do you
mean, diotima,' i said, 'is love then evil and foul?' 'hush,' she cried;
'must that be foul which is not fair?' 'certainly,' i said. 'and is that
which is not wise, ignorant? do you not see that there is a mean between
wisdom and ignorance?' 'and what may that be?' i said. 'right opinion,'
she replied; 'which, as you know, being incapable of giving a reason,
is not knowledge (for how can knowledge be devoid of reason? nor again,
ignorance, for neither can ignorance attain the truth), but is clearly
something which is a mean between ignorance and wisdom.' 'quite true,'
i replied. 'do not then insist,' she said, 'that what is not fair is of
necessity foul, or what is not good evil; or infer that because love
is not fair and good he is therefore foul and evil; for he is in a mean
between them.' 'well,' i said, 'love is surely admitted by all to be a
great god.' 'by those who know or by those who do not know?' 'by all.'
'and how, socrates,' she said with a smile, 'can love be acknowledged to
be a great god by those who say that he is not a god at all?' 'and who
are they?' i said. 'you and i are two of them,' she replied. 'how can
that be?' i said. 'it is quite intelligible,' she replied; 'for you
yourself would acknowledge that the gods are happy and fair--of course
you would--would you dare to say that any god was not?' 'certainly not,'
i replied. 'and you mean by the happy, those who are the possessors of
things good or fair?' 'yes.' 'and you admitted that love, because he
was in want, desires those good and fair things of which he is in want?'
'yes, i did.' 'but how can he be a god who has no portion in what is
either good or fair?' 'impossible.' 'then you see that you also deny the
divinity of love.'

'what then is love?' i asked; 'is he mortal?' 'no.' 'what then?' 'as in
the former instance, he is neither mortal nor immortal, but in a mean
between the two.' 'what is he, diotima?' 'he is a great spirit (daimon),
and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine and the
mortal.' 'and what,' i said, 'is his power?' 'he interprets,' she
replied, 'between gods and men, conveying and taking across to the gods
the prayers and sacrifices of men, and to men the commands and replies
of the gods; he is the mediator who spans the chasm which divides them,
and therefore in him all is bound together, and through him the arts of
the prophet and the priest, their sacrifices and mysteries and charms,
and all prophecy and incantation, find their way. for god mingles not
with man; but through love all the intercourse and converse of god
with man, whether awake or asleep, is carried on. the wisdom which
understands this is spiritual; all other wisdom, such as that of arts
and handicrafts, is mean and vulgar. now these spirits or intermediate
powers are many and diverse, and one of them is love.' 'and who,' i
said, 'was his father, and who his mother?' 'the tale,' she said, 'will
take time; nevertheless i will tell you. on the birthday of aphrodite
there was a feast of the gods, at which the god poros or plenty, who is
the son of metis or discretion, was one of the guests. when the feast
was over, penia or poverty, as the manner is on such occasions, came
about the doors to beg. now plenty who was the worse for nectar (there
was no wine in those days), went into the garden of zeus and fell into
a heavy sleep, and poverty considering her own straitened circumstances,
plotted to have a child by him, and accordingly she lay down at his side
and conceived love, who partly because he is naturally a lover of the
beautiful, and because aphrodite is herself beautiful, and also because
he was born on her birthday, is her follower and attendant. and as his
parentage is, so also are his fortunes. in the first place he is always
poor, and anything but tender and fair, as the many imagine him; and he
is rough and squalid, and has no shoes, nor a house to dwell in; on the
bare earth exposed he lies under the open heaven, in the streets, or at
the doors of houses, taking his rest; and like his mother he is always
in distress. like his father too, whom he also partly resembles, he is
always plotting against the fair and good; he is bold, enterprising,
strong, a mighty hunter, always weaving some intrigue or other, keen in
the pursuit of wisdom, fertile in resources; a philosopher at all times,
terrible as an enchanter, sorcerer, sophist. he is by nature neither
mortal nor immortal, but alive and flourishing at one moment when he is
in plenty, and dead at another moment, and again alive by reason of his
father's nature. but that which is always flowing in is always flowing
out, and so he is never in want and never in wealth; and, further, he
is in a mean between ignorance and knowledge. the truth of the matter
is this: no god is a philosopher or seeker after wisdom, for he is wise
already; nor does any man who is wise seek after wisdom. neither do the
ignorant seek after wisdom. for herein is the evil of ignorance, that he
who is neither good nor wise is nevertheless satisfied with himself:
he has no desire for that of which he feels no want.' 'but who then,
diotima,' i said, 'are the lovers of wisdom, if they are neither the
wise nor the foolish?' 'a child may answer that question,' she replied;
'they are those who are in a mean between the two; love is one of them.
for wisdom is a most beautiful thing, and love is of the beautiful; and
therefore love is also a philosopher or lover of wisdom, and being a
lover of wisdom is in a mean between the wise and the ignorant. and of
this too his birth is the cause; for his father is wealthy and wise, and
his mother poor and foolish. such, my dear socrates, is the nature of
the spirit love. the error in your conception of him was very natural,
and as i imagine from what you say, has arisen out of a confusion of
love and the beloved, which made you think that love was all beautiful.
for the beloved is the truly beautiful, and delicate, and perfect, and
blessed; but the principle of love is of another nature, and is such as
i have described.'

i said, 'o thou stranger woman, thou sayest well; but, assuming love to
be such as you say, what is the use of him to men?' 'that, socrates,'
she replied, 'i will attempt to unfold: of his nature and birth i have
already spoken; and you acknowledge that love is of the beautiful. but
some one will say: of the beautiful in what, socrates and diotima?--or
rather let me put the question more clearly, and ask: when a man loves
the beautiful, what does he desire?' i answered her 'that the beautiful
may be his.' 'still,' she said, 'the answer suggests a further question:
what is given by the possession of beauty?' 'to what you have asked,'
i replied, 'i have no answer ready.' 'then,' she said, 'let me put the
word "good" in the place of the beautiful, and repeat the question once
more: if he who loves loves the good, what is it then that he loves?'
'the possession of the good,' i said. 'and what does he gain who
possesses the good?' 'happiness,' i replied; 'there is less difficulty
in answering that question.' 'yes,' she said, 'the happy are made happy
by the acquisition of good things. nor is there any need to ask why a
man desires happiness; the answer is already final.' 'you are right.'
i said. 'and is this wish and this desire common to all? and do all men
always desire their own good, or only some men?--what say you?' 'all
men,' i replied; 'the desire is common to all.' 'why, then,' she
rejoined, 'are not all men, socrates, said to love, but only some of
them? whereas you say that all men are always loving the same things.'
'i myself wonder,' i said, 'why this is.' 'there is nothing to wonder
at,' she replied; 'the reason is that one part of love is separated
off and receives the name of the whole, but the other parts have other
names.' 'give an illustration,' i said. she answered me as follows:
'there is poetry, which, as you know, is complex and manifold. all
creation or passage of non-being into being is poetry or making, and the
processes of all art are creative; and the masters of arts are all poets
or makers.' 'very true.' 'still,' she said, 'you know that they are not
called poets, but have other names; only that portion of the art which
is separated off from the rest, and is concerned with music and metre,
is termed poetry, and they who possess poetry in this sense of the word
are called poets.' 'very true,' i said. 'and the same holds of love. for
you may say generally that all desire of good and happiness is only the
great and subtle power of love; but they who are drawn towards him
by any other path, whether the path of money-making or gymnastics or
philosophy, are not called lovers--the name of the whole is appropriated
to those whose affection takes one form only--they alone are said to
love, or to be lovers.' 'i dare say,' i replied, 'that you are right.'
'yes,' she added, 'and you hear people say that lovers are seeking for
their other half; but i say that they are seeking neither for the half
of themselves, nor for the whole, unless the half or the whole be also a
good. and they will cut off their own hands and feet and cast them away,
if they are evil; for they love not what is their own, unless perchance
there be some one who calls what belongs to him the good, and what
belongs to another the evil. for there is nothing which men love but
the good. is there anything?' 'certainly, i should say, that there is
nothing.' 'then,' she said, 'the simple truth is, that men love the
good.' 'yes,' i said. 'to which must be added that they love the
possession of the good?' 'yes, that must be added.' 'and not only the
possession, but the everlasting possession of the good?' 'that must be
added too.' 'then love,' she said, 'may be described generally as the
love of the everlasting possession of the good?' 'that is most true.'

'then if this be the nature of love, can you tell me further,' she said,
'what is the manner of the pursuit? what are they doing who show all
this eagerness and heat which is called love? and what is the object
which they have in view? answer me.' 'nay, diotima,' i replied, 'if i
had known, i should not have wondered at your wisdom, neither should i
have come to learn from you about this very matter.' 'well,' she said,
'i will teach you:--the object which they have in view is birth in
beauty, whether of body or soul.' 'i do not understand you,' i said;
'the oracle requires an explanation.' 'i will make my meaning clearer,'
she replied. 'i mean to say, that all men are bringing to the birth in
their bodies and in their souls. there is a certain age at which human
nature is desirous of procreation--procreation which must be in beauty
and not in deformity; and this procreation is the union of man and
woman, and is a divine thing; for conception and generation are an
immortal principle in the mortal creature, and in the inharmonious they
can never be. but the deformed is always inharmonious with the divine,
and the beautiful harmonious. beauty, then, is the destiny or goddess
of parturition who presides at birth, and therefore, when approaching
beauty, the conceiving power is propitious, and diffusive, and benign,
and begets and bears fruit: at the sight of ugliness she frowns and
contracts and has a sense of pain, and turns away, and shrivels up, and
not without a pang refrains from conception. and this is the reason why,
when the hour of conception arrives, and the teeming nature is full,
there is such a flutter and ecstasy about beauty whose approach is the
alleviation of the pain of travail. for love, socrates, is not, as you
imagine, the love of the beautiful only.' 'what then?' 'the love of
generation and of birth in beauty.' 'yes,' i said. 'yes, indeed,' she
replied. 'but why of generation?' 'because to the mortal creature,
generation is a sort of eternity and immortality,' she replied; 'and if,
as has been already admitted, love is of the everlasting possession
of the good, all men will necessarily desire immortality together with
good: wherefore love is of immortality.'

all this she taught me at various times when she spoke of love. and i
remember her once saying to me, 'what is the cause, socrates, of love,
and the attendant desire? see you not how all animals, birds, as well as
beasts, in their desire of procreation, are in agony when they take the
infection of love, which begins with the desire of union; whereto is
added the care of offspring, on whose behalf the weakest are ready to
battle against the strongest even to the uttermost, and to die for them,
and will let themselves be tormented with hunger or suffer anything
in order to maintain their young. man may be supposed to act thus from
reason; but why should animals have these passionate feelings? can you
tell me why?' again i replied that i did not know. she said to me: 'and
do you expect ever to become a master in the art of love, if you do not
know this?' 'but i have told you already, diotima, that my ignorance is
the reason why i come to you; for i am conscious that i want a teacher;
tell me then the cause of this and of the other mysteries of love.'
'marvel not,' she said, 'if you believe that love is of the immortal,
as we have several times acknowledged; for here again, and on the same
principle too, the mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to be
everlasting and immortal: and this is only to be attained by generation,
because generation always leaves behind a new existence in the place of
the old. nay even in the life of the same individual there is succession
and not absolute unity: a man is called the same, and yet in the short
interval which elapses between youth and age, and in which every animal
is said to have life and identity, he is undergoing a perpetual process
of loss and reparation--hair, flesh, bones, blood, and the whole body
are always changing. which is true not only of the body, but also of the
soul, whose habits, tempers, opinions, desires, pleasures, pains, fears,
never remain the same in any one of us, but are always coming and going;
and equally true of knowledge, and what is still more surprising to us
mortals, not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay,
so that in respect of them we are never the same; but each of them
individually experiences a like change. for what is implied in the word
"recollection," but the departure of knowledge, which is ever being
forgotten, and is renewed and preserved by recollection, and appears to
be the same although in reality new, according to that law of succession
by which all mortal things are preserved, not absolutely the same, but
by substitution, the old worn-out mortality leaving another new and
similar existence behind--unlike the divine, which is always the same
and not another? and in this way, socrates, the mortal body, or mortal
anything, partakes of immortality; but the immortal in another way.
marvel not then at the love which all men have of their offspring; for
that universal love and interest is for the sake of immortality.'

i was astonished at her words, and said: 'is this really true, o
thou wise diotima?' and she answered with all the authority of an
accomplished sophist: 'of that, socrates, you may be assured;--think
only of the ambition of men, and you will wonder at the senselessness of
their ways, unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of an
immortality of fame. they are ready to run all risks greater far than
they would have run for their children, and to spend money and undergo
any sort of toil, and even to die, for the sake of leaving behind them
a name which shall be eternal. do you imagine that alcestis would have
died to save admetus, or achilles to avenge patroclus, or your own
codrus in order to preserve the kingdom for his sons, if they had not
imagined that the memory of their virtues, which still survives among
us, would be immortal? nay,' she said, 'i am persuaded that all men do
all things, and the better they are the more they do them, in hope of
the glorious fame of immortal virtue; for they desire the immortal.

'those who are pregnant in the body only, betake themselves to women and
beget children--this is the character of their love; their offspring,
as they hope, will preserve their memory and giving them the blessedness
and immortality which they desire in the future. but souls which are
pregnant--for there certainly are men who are more creative in their
souls than in their bodies--conceive that which is proper for the soul
to conceive or contain. and what are these conceptions?--wisdom and
virtue in general. and such creators are poets and all artists who are
deserving of the name inventor. but the greatest and fairest sort of
wisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of states
and families, and which is called temperance and justice. and he who in
youth has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself inspired,
when he comes to maturity desires to beget and generate. he wanders
about seeking beauty that he may beget offspring--for in deformity he
will beget nothing--and naturally embraces the beautiful rather than
the deformed body; above all when he finds a fair and noble and
well-nurtured soul, he embraces the two in one person, and to such an
one he is full of speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of a
good man; and he tries to educate him; and at the touch of the beautiful
which is ever present to his memory, even when absent, he brings forth
that which he had conceived long before, and in company with him tends
that which he brings forth; and they are married by a far nearer tie and
have a closer friendship than those who beget mortal children, for the
children who are their common offspring are fairer and more immortal.
who, when he thinks of homer and hesiod and other great poets, would
not rather have their children than ordinary human ones? who would not
emulate them in the creation of children such as theirs, which have
preserved their memory and given them everlasting glory? or who would
not have such children as lycurgus left behind him to be the saviours,
not only of lacedaemon, but of hellas, as one may say? there is solon,
too, who is the revered father of athenian laws; and many others there
are in many other places, both among hellenes and barbarians, who have
given to the world many noble works, and have been the parents of virtue
of every kind; and many temples have been raised in their honour for the
sake of children such as theirs; which were never raised in honour of
any one, for the sake of his mortal children.

'these are the lesser mysteries of love, into which even you, socrates,
may enter; to the greater and more hidden ones which are the crown of
these, and to which, if you pursue them in a right spirit, they will
lead, i know not whether you will be able to attain. but i will do my
utmost to inform you, and do you follow if you can. for he who would
proceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautiful
forms; and first, if he be guided by his instructor aright, to love one
such form only--out of that he should create fair thoughts; and soon
he will of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the
beauty of another; and then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit,
how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form
is and the same! and when he perceives this he will abate his violent
love of the one, which he will despise and deem a small thing, and
will become a lover of all beautiful forms; in the next stage he will
consider that the beauty of the mind is more honourable than the beauty
of the outward form. so that if a virtuous soul have but a little
comeliness, he will be content to love and tend him, and will search out
and bring to the birth thoughts which may improve the young, until he
is compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws,
and to understand that the beauty of them all is of one family, and that
personal beauty is a trifle; and after laws and institutions he will
go on to the sciences, that he may see their beauty, being not like
a servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or institution,
himself a slave mean and narrow-minded, but drawing towards and
contemplating the vast sea of beauty, he will create many fair and noble
thoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom; until on that shore he
grows and waxes strong, and at last the vision is revealed to him of
a single science, which is the science of beauty everywhere. to this i
will proceed; please to give me your very best attention:

'he who has been instructed thus far in the things of love, and who has
learned to see the beautiful in due order and succession, when he comes
toward the end will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous beauty (and
this, socrates, is the final cause of all our former toils)--a nature
which in the first place is everlasting, not growing and decaying, or
waxing and waning; secondly, not fair in one point of view and foul
in another, or at one time or in one relation or at one place fair, at
another time or in another relation or at another place foul, as if fair
to some and foul to others, or in the likeness of a face or hands or any
other part of the bodily frame, or in any form of speech or knowledge,
or existing in any other being, as for example, in an animal, or
in heaven, or in earth, or in any other place; but beauty absolute,
separate, simple, and everlasting, which without diminution and without
increase, or any change, is imparted to the ever-growing and perishing
beauties of all other things. he who from these ascending under the
influence of true love, begins to perceive that beauty, is not far from
the end. and the true order of going, or being led by another, to the
things of love, is to begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards
for the sake of that other beauty, using these as steps only, and from
one going on to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair forms
to fair practices, and from fair practices to fair notions, until from
fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty, and at last
knows what the essence of beauty is. this, my dear socrates,' said the
stranger of mantineia, 'is that life above all others which man should
live, in the contemplation of beauty absolute; a beauty which if you
once beheld, you would see not to be after the measure of gold, and
garments, and fair boys and youths, whose presence now entrances you;
and you and many a one would be content to live seeing them only and
conversing with them without meat or drink, if that were possible--you
only want to look at them and to be with them. but what if man had eyes
to see the true beauty--the divine beauty, i mean, pure and clear and
unalloyed, not clogged with the pollutions of mortality and all the
colours and vanities of human life--thither looking, and holding
converse with the true beauty simple and divine? remember how in that
communion only, beholding beauty with the eye of the mind, he will be
enabled to bring forth, not images of beauty, but realities (for he
has hold not of an image but of a reality), and bringing forth and
nourishing true virtue to become the friend of god and be immortal, if
mortal man may. would that be an ignoble life?'

such, phaedrus--and i speak not only to you, but to all of you--were the
words of diotima; and i am persuaded of their truth. and being persuaded
of them, i try to persuade others, that in the attainment of this
end human nature will not easily find a helper better than love: and
therefore, also, i say that every man ought to honour him as i myself
honour him, and walk in his ways, and exhort others to do the same,
and praise the power and spirit of love according to the measure of my
ability now and ever.

the words which i have spoken, you, phaedrus, may call an encomium of
love, or anything else which you please.

when socrates had done speaking, the company applauded, and aristophanes
was beginning to say something in answer to the allusion which socrates
had made to his own speech, when suddenly there was a great knocking at
the door of the house, as of revellers, and the sound of a flute-girl
was heard. agathon told the attendants to go and see who were the
intruders. 'if they are friends of ours,' he said, 'invite them in, but
if not, say that the drinking is over.' a little while afterwards they
heard the voice of alcibiades resounding in the court; he was in a great
state of intoxication, and kept roaring and shouting 'where is agathon?
lead me to agathon,' and at length, supported by the flute-girl and some
of his attendants, he found his way to them. 'hail, friends,' he said,
appearing at the door crowned with a massive garland of ivy and violets,
his head flowing with ribands. 'will you have a very drunken man as
a companion of your revels? or shall i crown agathon, which was my
intention in coming, and go away? for i was unable to come yesterday,
and therefore i am here to-day, carrying on my head these ribands, that
taking them from my own head, i may crown the head of this fairest and
wisest of men, as i may be allowed to call him. will you laugh at me
because i am drunk? yet i know very well that i am speaking the truth,
although you may laugh. but first tell me; if i come in shall we have
the understanding of which i spoke (supra will you have a very drunken
man? etc.)? will you drink with me or not?'

the company were vociferous in begging that he would take his place
among them, and agathon specially invited him. thereupon he was led in
by the people who were with him; and as he was being led, intending to
crown agathon, he took the ribands from his own head and held them in
front of his eyes; he was thus prevented from seeing socrates, who made
way for him, and alcibiades took the vacant place between agathon and
socrates, and in taking the place he embraced agathon and crowned him.
take off his sandals, said agathon, and let him make a third on the same
couch.

by all means; but who makes the third partner in our revels? said
alcibiades, turning round and starting up as he caught sight of
socrates. by heracles, he said, what is this? here is socrates always
lying in wait for me, and always, as his way is, coming out at all sorts
of unsuspected places: and now, what have you to say for yourself, and
why are you lying here, where i perceive that you have contrived to find
a place, not by a joker or lover of jokes, like aristophanes, but by the
fairest of the company?

socrates turned to agathon and said: i must ask you to protect me,
agathon; for the passion of this man has grown quite a serious matter to
me. since i became his admirer i have never been allowed to speak to
any other fair one, or so much as to look at them. if i do, he goes wild
with envy and jealousy, and not only abuses me but can hardly keep his
hands off me, and at this moment he may do me some harm. please to see
to this, and either reconcile me to him, or, if he attempts violence,
protect me, as i am in bodily fear of his mad and passionate attempts.

there can never be reconciliation between you and me, said alcibiades;
but for the present i will defer your chastisement. and i must beg
you, agathon, to give me back some of the ribands that i may crown the
marvellous head of this universal despot--i would not have him complain
of me for crowning you, and neglecting him, who in conversation is the
conqueror of all mankind; and this not only once, as you were the day
before yesterday, but always. whereupon, taking some of the ribands, he
crowned socrates, and again reclined.

then he said: you seem, my friends, to be sober, which is a thing not to
be endured; you must drink--for that was the agreement under which i
was admitted--and i elect myself master of the feast until you are
well drunk. let us have a large goblet, agathon, or rather, he said,
addressing the attendant, bring me that wine-cooler. the wine-cooler
which had caught his eye was a vessel holding more than two quarts--this
he filled and emptied, and bade the attendant fill it again for
socrates. observe, my friends, said alcibiades, that this ingenious
trick of mine will have no effect on socrates, for he can drink any
quantity of wine and not be at all nearer being drunk. socrates drank
the cup which the attendant filled for him.

eryximachus said: what is this, alcibiades? are we to have neither
conversation nor singing over our cups; but simply to drink as if we
were thirsty?

alcibiades replied: hail, worthy son of a most wise and worthy sire!

the same to you, said eryximachus; but what shall we do?

that i leave to you, said alcibiades.

'the wise physician skilled our wounds to heal (from pope's homer, il.)'

shall prescribe and we will obey. what do you want?

well, said eryximachus, before you appeared we had passed a resolution
that each one of us in turn should make a speech in praise of love, and
as good a one as he could: the turn was passed round from left to right;
and as all of us have spoken, and you have not spoken but have well
drunken, you ought to speak, and then impose upon socrates any task
which you please, and he on his right hand neighbour, and so on.

that is good, eryximachus, said alcibiades; and yet the comparison of
a drunken man's speech with those of sober men is hardly fair; and
i should like to know, sweet friend, whether you really believe what
socrates was just now saying; for i can assure you that the very reverse
is the fact, and that if i praise any one but himself in his presence,
whether god or man, he will hardly keep his hands off me.

for shame, said socrates.

hold your tongue, said alcibiades, for by poseidon, there is no one else
whom i will praise when you are of the company.

well then, said eryximachus, if you like praise socrates.

what do you think, eryximachus? said alcibiades: shall i attack him and
inflict the punishment before you all?

what are you about? said socrates; are you going to raise a laugh at my
expense? is that the meaning of your praise?

i am going to speak the truth, if you will permit me.

i not only permit, but exhort you to speak the truth.

then i will begin at once, said alcibiades, and if i say anything which
is not true, you may interrupt me if you will, and say 'that is a lie,'
though my intention is to speak the truth. but you must not wonder if
i speak any how as things come into my mind; for the fluent and orderly
enumeration of all your singularities is not a task which is easy to a
man in my condition.

and now, my boys, i shall praise socrates in a figure which will appear
to him to be a caricature, and yet i speak, not to make fun of him, but
only for the truth's sake. i say, that he is exactly like the busts of
silenus, which are set up in the statuaries' shops, holding pipes and
flutes in their mouths; and they are made to open in the middle, and
have images of gods inside them. i say also that he is like marsyas the
satyr. you yourself will not deny, socrates, that your face is like that
of a satyr. aye, and there is a resemblance in other points too. for
example, you are a bully, as i can prove by witnesses, if you will not
confess. and are you not a flute-player? that you are, and a performer
far more wonderful than marsyas. he indeed with instruments used to
charm the souls of men by the power of his breath, and the players of
his music do so still: for the melodies of olympus (compare arist. pol.)
are derived from marsyas who taught them, and these, whether they are
played by a great master or by a miserable flute-girl, have a power
which no others have; they alone possess the soul and reveal the wants
of those who have need of gods and mysteries, because they are divine.
but you produce the same effect with your words only, and do not require
the flute: that is the difference between you and him. when we hear any
other speaker, even a very good one, he produces absolutely no effect
upon us, or not much, whereas the mere fragments of you and your words,
even at second-hand, and however imperfectly repeated, amaze and possess
the souls of every man, woman, and child who comes within hearing of
them. and if i were not afraid that you would think me hopelessly drunk,
i would have sworn as well as spoken to the influence which they have
always had and still have over me. for my heart leaps within me more
than that of any corybantian reveller, and my eyes rain tears when
i hear them. and i observe that many others are affected in the same
manner. i have heard pericles and other great orators, and i thought
that they spoke well, but i never had any similar feeling; my soul was
not stirred by them, nor was i angry at the thought of my own slavish
state. but this marsyas has often brought me to such a pass, that i
have felt as if i could hardly endure the life which i am leading (this,
socrates, you will admit); and i am conscious that if i did not shut my
ears against him, and fly as from the voice of the siren, my fate would
be like that of others,--he would transfix me, and i should grow old
sitting at his feet. for he makes me confess that i ought not to live as
i do, neglecting the wants of my own soul, and busying myself with the
concerns of the athenians; therefore i hold my ears and tear myself away
from him. and he is the only person who ever made me ashamed, which you
might think not to be in my nature, and there is no one else who does
the same. for i know that i cannot answer him or say that i ought not to
do as he bids, but when i leave his presence the love of popularity gets
the better of me. and therefore i run away and fly from him, and when i
see him i am ashamed of what i have confessed to him. many a time have
i wished that he were dead, and yet i know that i should be much more
sorry than glad, if he were to die: so that i am at my wit's end.

and this is what i and many others have suffered from the flute-playing
of this satyr. yet hear me once more while i show you how exact the
image is, and how marvellous his power. for let me tell you; none of you
know him; but i will reveal him to you; having begun, i must go on. see
you how fond he is of the fair? he is always with them and is always
being smitten by them, and then again he knows nothing and is ignorant
of all things--such is the appearance which he puts on. is he not like a
silenus in this? to be sure he is: his outer mask is the carved head
of the silenus; but, o my companions in drink, when he is opened, what
temperance there is residing within! know you that beauty and wealth and
honour, at which the many wonder, are of no account with him, and are
utterly despised by him: he regards not at all the persons who are
gifted with them; mankind are nothing to him; all his life is spent in
mocking and flouting at them. but when i opened him, and looked within
at his serious purpose, i saw in him divine and golden images of such
fascinating beauty that i was ready to do in a moment whatever socrates
commanded: they may have escaped the observation of others, but i saw
them. now i fancied that he was seriously enamoured of my beauty, and i
thought that i should therefore have a grand opportunity of hearing him
tell what he knew, for i had a wonderful opinion of the attractions of
my youth. in the prosecution of this design, when i next went to him, i
sent away the attendant who usually accompanied me (i will confess the
whole truth, and beg you to listen; and if i speak falsely, do you,
socrates, expose the falsehood). well, he and i were alone together, and
i thought that when there was nobody with us, i should hear him
speak the language which lovers use to their loves when they are by
themselves, and i was delighted. nothing of the sort; he conversed
as usual, and spent the day with me and then went away. afterwards i
challenged him to the palaestra; and he wrestled and closed with me
several times when there was no one present; i fancied that i might
succeed in this manner. not a bit; i made no way with him. lastly, as
i had failed hitherto, i thought that i must take stronger measures and
attack him boldly, and, as i had begun, not give him up, but see how
matters stood between him and me. so i invited him to sup with me, just
as if he were a fair youth, and i a designing lover. he was not easily
persuaded to come; he did, however, after a while accept the invitation,
and when he came the first time, he wanted to go away at once as soon as
supper was over, and i had not the face to detain him. the second
time, still in pursuance of my design, after we had supped, i went
on conversing far into the night, and when he wanted to go away, i
pretended that the hour was late and that he had much better remain. so
he lay down on the couch next to me, the same on which he had supped,
and there was no one but ourselves sleeping in the apartment. all this
may be told without shame to any one. but what follows i could hardly
tell you if i were sober. yet as the proverb says, 'in vino veritas,'
whether with boys, or without them (in allusion to two proverbs.); and
therefore i must speak. nor, again, should i be justified in concealing
the lofty actions of socrates when i come to praise him. moreover i
have felt the serpent's sting; and he who has suffered, as they say, is
willing to tell his fellow-sufferers only, as they alone will be likely
to understand him, and will not be extreme in judging of the sayings or
doings which have been wrung from his agony. for i have been bitten by a
more than viper's tooth; i have known in my soul, or in my heart, or in
some other part, that worst of pangs, more violent in ingenuous youth
than any serpent's tooth, the pang of philosophy, which will make a man
say or do anything. and you whom i see around me, phaedrus and agathon
and eryximachus and pausanias and aristodemus and aristophanes, all of
you, and i need not say socrates himself, have had experience of the
same madness and passion in your longing after wisdom. therefore listen
and excuse my doings then and my sayings now. but let the attendants and
other profane and unmannered persons close up the doors of their ears.

when the lamp was put out and the servants had gone away, i thought that
i must be plain with him and have no more ambiguity. so i gave him a
shake, and i said: 'socrates, are you asleep?' 'no,' he said. 'do
you know what i am meditating? 'what are you meditating?' he said. 'i
think,' i replied, 'that of all the lovers whom i have ever had you are
the only one who is worthy of me, and you appear to be too modest to
speak. now i feel that i should be a fool to refuse you this or any
other favour, and therefore i come to lay at your feet all that i have
and all that my friends have, in the hope that you will assist me in the
way of virtue, which i desire above all things, and in which i believe
that you can help me better than any one else. and i should certainly
have more reason to be ashamed of what wise men would say if i were to
refuse a favour to such as you, than of what the world, who are mostly
fools, would say of me if i granted it.' to these words he replied in
the ironical manner which is so characteristic of him:--'alcibiades, my
friend, you have indeed an elevated aim if what you say is true, and if
there really is in me any power by which you may become better; truly
you must see in me some rare beauty of a kind infinitely higher than any
which i see in you. and therefore, if you mean to share with me and to
exchange beauty for beauty, you will have greatly the advantage of me;
you will gain true beauty in return for appearance--like diomede, gold
in exchange for brass. but look again, sweet friend, and see whether you
are not deceived in me. the mind begins to grow critical when the bodily
eye fails, and it will be a long time before you get old.' hearing this,
i said: 'i have told you my purpose, which is quite serious, and do you
consider what you think best for you and me.' 'that is good,' he said;
'at some other time then we will consider and act as seems best about
this and about other matters.' whereupon, i fancied that he was smitten,
and that the words which i had uttered like arrows had wounded him, and
so without waiting to hear more i got up, and throwing my coat about him
crept under his threadbare cloak, as the time of year was winter, and
there i lay during the whole night having this wonderful monster in
my arms. this again, socrates, will not be denied by you. and yet,
notwithstanding all, he was so superior to my solicitations, so
contemptuous and derisive and disdainful of my beauty--which really, as
i fancied, had some attractions--hear, o judges; for judges you shall
be of the haughty virtue of socrates--nothing more happened, but in the
morning when i awoke (let all the gods and goddesses be my witnesses) i
arose as from the couch of a father or an elder brother.

what do you suppose must have been my feelings, after this rejection, at
the thought of my own dishonour? and yet i could not help wondering
at his natural temperance and self-restraint and manliness. i never
imagined that i could have met with a man such as he is in wisdom and
endurance. and therefore i could not be angry with him or renounce his
company, any more than i could hope to win him. for i well knew that if
ajax could not be wounded by steel, much less he by money; and my only
chance of captivating him by my personal attractions had failed. so
i was at my wit's end; no one was ever more hopelessly enslaved by
another. all this happened before he and i went on the expedition
to potidaea; there we messed together, and i had the opportunity of
observing his extraordinary power of sustaining fatigue. his endurance
was simply marvellous when, being cut off from our supplies, we were
compelled to go without food--on such occasions, which often happen in
time of war, he was superior not only to me but to everybody; there was
no one to be compared to him. yet at a festival he was the only person
who had any real powers of enjoyment; though not willing to drink, he
could if compelled beat us all at that,--wonderful to relate! no
human being had ever seen socrates drunk; and his powers, if i am not
mistaken, will be tested before long. his fortitude in enduring cold was
also surprising. there was a severe frost, for the winter in that region
is really tremendous, and everybody else either remained indoors, or if
they went out had on an amazing quantity of clothes, and were well shod,
and had their feet swathed in felt and fleeces: in the midst of this,
socrates with his bare feet on the ice and in his ordinary dress marched
better than the other soldiers who had shoes, and they looked daggers at
him because he seemed to despise them.

i have told you one tale, and now i must tell you another, which is
worth hearing,

'of the doings and sufferings of the enduring man'

while he was on the expedition. one morning he was thinking about
something which he could not resolve; he would not give it up, but
continued thinking from early dawn until noon--there he stood fixed
in thought; and at noon attention was drawn to him, and the rumour ran
through the wondering crowd that socrates had been standing and thinking
about something ever since the break of day. at last, in the evening
after supper, some ionians out of curiosity (i should explain that this
was not in winter but in summer), brought out their mats and slept in
the open air that they might watch him and see whether he would stand
all night. there he stood until the following morning; and with the
return of light he offered up a prayer to the sun, and went his way
(compare supra). i will also tell, if you please--and indeed i am bound
to tell--of his courage in battle; for who but he saved my life? now
this was the engagement in which i received the prize of valour: for i
was wounded and he would not leave me, but he rescued me and my arms;
and he ought to have received the prize of valour which the generals
wanted to confer on me partly on account of my rank, and i told them so,
(this, again, socrates will not impeach or deny), but he was more eager
than the generals that i and not he should have the prize. there was
another occasion on which his behaviour was very remarkable--in the
flight of the army after the battle of delium, where he served among the
heavy-armed,--i had a better opportunity of seeing him than at potidaea,
for i was myself on horseback, and therefore comparatively out of
danger. he and laches were retreating, for the troops were in flight,
and i met them and told them not to be discouraged, and promised to
remain with them; and there you might see him, aristophanes, as you
describe (aristoph. clouds), just as he is in the streets of athens,
stalking like a pelican, and rolling his eyes, calmly contemplating
enemies as well as friends, and making very intelligible to anybody,
even from a distance, that whoever attacked him would be likely to
meet with a stout resistance; and in this way he and his companion
escaped--for this is the sort of man who is never touched in war; those
only are pursued who are running away headlong. i particularly observed
how superior he was to laches in presence of mind. many are the marvels
which i might narrate in praise of socrates; most of his ways might
perhaps be paralleled in another man, but his absolute unlikeness to any
human being that is or ever has been is perfectly astonishing. you
may imagine brasidas and others to have been like achilles; or you may
imagine nestor and antenor to have been like pericles; and the same may
be said of other famous men, but of this strange being you will never be
able to find any likeness, however remote, either among men who now are
or who ever have been--other than that which i have already suggested of
silenus and the satyrs; and they represent in a figure not only himself,
but his words. for, although i forgot to mention this to you before,
his words are like the images of silenus which open; they are ridiculous
when you first hear them; he clothes himself in language that is like
the skin of the wanton satyr--for his talk is of pack-asses and smiths
and cobblers and curriers, and he is always repeating the same things
in the same words (compare gorg.), so that any ignorant or inexperienced
person might feel disposed to laugh at him; but he who opens the bust
and sees what is within will find that they are the only words which
have a meaning in them, and also the most divine, abounding in fair
images of virtue, and of the widest comprehension, or rather extending
to the whole duty of a good and honourable man.

this, friends, is my praise of socrates. i have added my blame of him
for his ill-treatment of me; and he has ill-treated not only me, but
charmides the son of glaucon, and euthydemus the son of diocles, and
many others in the same way--beginning as their lover he has ended by
making them pay their addresses to him. wherefore i say to you, agathon,
'be not deceived by him; learn from me and take warning, and do not be a
fool and learn by experience, as the proverb says.'

when alcibiades had finished, there was a laugh at his outspokenness;
for he seemed to be still in love with socrates. you are sober,
alcibiades, said socrates, or you would never have gone so far about
to hide the purpose of your satyr's praises, for all this long story is
only an ingenious circumlocution, of which the point comes in by the
way at the end; you want to get up a quarrel between me and agathon, and
your notion is that i ought to love you and nobody else, and that you
and you only ought to love agathon. but the plot of this satyric or
silenic drama has been detected, and you must not allow him, agathon, to
set us at variance.

i believe you are right, said agathon, and i am disposed to think that
his intention in placing himself between you and me was only to divide
us; but he shall gain nothing by that move; for i will go and lie on the
couch next to you.

yes, yes, replied socrates, by all means come here and lie on the couch
below me.

alas, said alcibiades, how i am fooled by this man; he is determined to
get the better of me at every turn. i do beseech you, allow agathon to
lie between us.

certainly not, said socrates, as you praised me, and i in turn ought to
praise my neighbour on the right, he will be out of order in praising me
again when he ought rather to be praised by me, and i must entreat you
to consent to this, and not be jealous, for i have a great desire to
praise the youth.

hurrah! cried agathon, i will rise instantly, that i may be praised by
socrates.

the usual way, said alcibiades; where socrates is, no one else has any
chance with the fair; and now how readily has he invented a specious
reason for attracting agathon to himself.

agathon arose in order that he might take his place on the couch by
socrates, when suddenly a band of revellers entered, and spoiled the
order of the banquet. some one who was going out having left the door
open, they had found their way in, and made themselves at home; great
confusion ensued, and every one was compelled to drink large quantities
of wine. aristodemus said that eryximachus, phaedrus, and others went
away--he himself fell asleep, and as the nights were long took a good
rest: he was awakened towards daybreak by a crowing of cocks, and
when he awoke, the others were either asleep, or had gone away; there
remained only socrates, aristophanes, and agathon, who were drinking out
of a large goblet which they passed round, and socrates was discoursing
to them. aristodemus was only half awake, and he did not hear the
beginning of the discourse; the chief thing which he remembered was
socrates compelling the other two to acknowledge that the genius of
comedy was the same with that of tragedy, and that the true artist in
tragedy was an artist in comedy also. to this they were constrained to
assent, being drowsy, and not quite following the argument. and first
of all aristophanes dropped off, then, when the day was already
dawning, agathon. socrates, having laid them to sleep, rose to depart;
aristodemus, as his manner was, following him. at the lyceum he took a
bath, and passed the day as usual. in the evening he retired to rest at
his own home.

introduction.

after an interval of some months or years, and at phlius, a town of
peloponnesus, the tale of the last hours of socrates is narrated to
echecrates and other phliasians by phaedo the 'beloved disciple.' the
dialogue necessarily takes the form of a narrative, because socrates has
to be described acting as well as speaking. the minutest particulars of
the event are interesting to distant friends, and the narrator has an
equal interest in them.

during the voyage of the sacred ship to and from delos, which has
occupied thirty days, the execution of socrates has been deferred.
(compare xen. mem.) the time has been passed by him in conversation with
a select company of disciples. but now the holy season is over, and the
disciples meet earlier than usual in order that they may converse with
socrates for the last time. those who were present, and those who might
have been expected to be present, are mentioned by name. there are
simmias and cebes (crito), two disciples of philolaus whom socrates
'by his enchantments has attracted from thebes' (mem.), crito the aged
friend, the attendant of the prison, who is as good as a friend--these
take part in the conversation. there are present also, hermogenes,
from whom xenophon derived his information about the trial of socrates
(mem.), the 'madman' apollodorus (symp.), euclid and terpsion from
megara (compare theaet.), ctesippus, antisthenes, menexenus, and some
other less-known members of the socratic circle, all of whom are silent
auditors. aristippus, cleombrotus, and plato are noted as absent. almost
as soon as the friends of socrates enter the prison xanthippe and her
children are sent home in the care of one of crito's servants.
socrates himself has just been released from chains, and is led by this
circumstance to make the natural remark that 'pleasure follows pain.'
(observe that plato is preparing the way for his doctrine of the
alternation of opposites.) 'aesop would have represented them in a fable
as a two-headed creature of the gods.' the mention of aesop reminds
cebes of a question which had been asked by evenus the poet (compare
apol.): 'why socrates, who was not a poet, while in prison had been
putting aesop into verse?'--'because several times in his life he had
been warned in dreams that he should practise music; and as he was about
to die and was not certain of what was meant, he wished to fulfil the
admonition in the letter as well as in the spirit, by writing verses as
well as by cultivating philosophy. tell this to evenus; and say that i
would have him follow me in death.' 'he is not at all the sort of man
to comply with your request, socrates.' 'why, is he not a philosopher?'
'yes.' 'then he will be willing to die, although he will not take his
own life, for that is held to be unlawful.'

cebes asks why suicide is thought not to be right, if death is to be
accounted a good? well, (1) according to one explanation, because man is
a prisoner, who must not open the door of his prison and run away--this
is the truth in a 'mystery.' or (2) rather, because he is not his own
property, but a possession of the gods, and has no right to make away
with that which does not belong to him. but why, asks cebes, if he is a
possession of the gods, should he wish to die and leave them? for he is
under their protection; and surely he cannot take better care of himself
than they take of him. simmias explains that cebes is really referring
to socrates, whom they think too unmoved at the prospect of leaving the
gods and his friends. socrates answers that he is going to other gods
who are wise and good, and perhaps to better friends; and he professes
that he is ready to defend himself against the charge of cebes.
the company shall be his judges, and he hopes that he will be more
successful in convincing them than he had been in convincing the court.

the philosopher desires death--which the wicked world will insinuate
that he also deserves: and perhaps he does, but not in any sense which
they are capable of understanding. enough of them: the real question
is, what is the nature of that death which he desires? death is
the separation of soul and body--and the philosopher desires such
a separation. he would like to be freed from the dominion of bodily
pleasures and of the senses, which are always perturbing his mental
vision. he wants to get rid of eyes and ears, and with the light of the
mind only to behold the light of truth. all the evils and impurities
and necessities of men come from the body. and death separates him from
these corruptions, which in life he cannot wholly lay aside. why then
should he repine when the hour of separation arrives? why, if he is dead
while he lives, should he fear that other death, through which alone he
can behold wisdom in her purity?

besides, the philosopher has notions of good and evil unlike those of
other men. for they are courageous because they are afraid of greater
dangers, and temperate because they desire greater pleasures. but he
disdains this balancing of pleasures and pains, which is the exchange
of commerce and not of virtue. all the virtues, including wisdom, are
regarded by him only as purifications of the soul. and this was the
meaning of the founders of the mysteries when they said, 'many are the
wand-bearers but few are the mystics.' (compare matt. xxii.: 'many are
called but few are chosen.') and in the hope that he is one of these
mystics, socrates is now departing. this is his answer to any one who
charges him with indifference at the prospect of leaving the gods and
his friends.

still, a fear is expressed that the soul upon leaving the body may
vanish away like smoke or air. socrates in answer appeals first of all
to the old orphic tradition that the souls of the dead are in the world
below, and that the living come from them. this he attempts to found
on a philosophical assumption that all opposites--e.g. less, greater;
weaker, stronger; sleeping, waking; life, death--are generated out of
each other. nor can the process of generation be only a passage from
living to dying, for then all would end in death. the perpetual sleeper
(endymion) would be no longer distinguished from the rest of mankind.
the circle of nature is not complete unless the living come from the
dead as well as pass to them.

the platonic doctrine of reminiscence is then adduced as a confirmation
of the pre-existence of the soul. some proofs of this doctrine are
demanded. one proof given is the same as that of the meno, and is
derived from the latent knowledge of mathematics, which may be elicited
from an unlearned person when a diagram is presented to him. again,
there is a power of association, which from seeing simmias may remember
cebes, or from seeing a picture of simmias may remember simmias. the
lyre may recall the player of the lyre, and equal pieces of wood or
stone may be associated with the higher notion of absolute equality. but
here observe that material equalities fall short of the conception of
absolute equality with which they are compared, and which is the measure
of them. and the measure or standard must be prior to that which is
measured, the idea of equality prior to the visible equals. and if prior
to them, then prior also to the perceptions of the senses which recall
them, and therefore either given before birth or at birth. but all men
have not this knowledge, nor have any without a process of reminiscence;
which is a proof that it is not innate or given at birth, unless indeed
it was given and taken away at the same instant. but if not given to
men in birth, it must have been given before birth--this is the only
alternative which remains. and if we had ideas in a former state, then
our souls must have existed and must have had intelligence in a former
state. the pre-existence of the soul stands or falls with the doctrine
of ideas.

it is objected by simmias and cebes that these arguments only prove a
former and not a future existence. socrates answers this objection by
recalling the previous argument, in which he had shown that the living
come from the dead. but the fear that the soul at departing may vanish
into air (especially if there is a wind blowing at the time) has not yet
been charmed away. he proceeds: when we fear that the soul will vanish
away, let us ask ourselves what is that which we suppose to be liable
to dissolution? is it the simple or the compound, the unchanging or the
changing, the invisible idea or the visible object of sense? clearly the
latter and not the former; and therefore not the soul, which in her own
pure thought is unchangeable, and only when using the senses descends
into the region of change. again, the soul commands, the body serves:
in this respect too the soul is akin to the divine, and the body to the
mortal. and in every point of view the soul is the image of divinity and
immortality, and the body of the human and mortal. and whereas the
body is liable to speedy dissolution, the soul is almost if not quite
indissoluble. (compare tim.) yet even the body may be preserved for ages
by the embalmer's art: how unlikely, then, that the soul will perish and
be dissipated into air while on her way to the good and wise god!
she has been gathered into herself, holding aloof from the body, and
practising death all her life long, and she is now finally released from
the errors and follies and passions of men, and for ever dwells in the
company of the gods.

but the soul which is polluted and engrossed by the corporeal, and has
no eye except that of the senses, and is weighed down by the bodily
appetites, cannot attain to this abstraction. in her fear of the world
below she lingers about the sepulchre, loath to leave the body which
she loved, a ghostly apparition, saturated with sense, and therefore
visible. at length entering into some animal of a nature congenial to
her former life of sensuality or violence, she takes the form of an ass,
a wolf or a kite. and of these earthly souls the happiest are those who
have practised virtue without philosophy; they are allowed to pass into
gentle and social natures, such as bees and ants. (compare republic,
meno.) but only the philosopher who departs pure is permitted to enter
the company of the gods. (compare phaedrus.) this is the reason why he
abstains from fleshly lusts, and not because he fears loss or disgrace,
which is the motive of other men. he too has been a captive, and the
willing agent of his own captivity. but philosophy has spoken to him,
and he has heard her voice; she has gently entreated him, and brought
him out of the 'miry clay,' and purged away the mists of passion and
the illusions of sense which envelope him; his soul has escaped from the
influence of pleasures and pains, which are like nails fastening her to
the body. to that prison-house she will not return; and therefore she
abstains from bodily pleasures--not from a desire of having more or
greater ones, but because she knows that only when calm and free from
the dominion of the body can she behold the light of truth.

simmias and cebes remain in doubt; but they are unwilling to raise
objections at such a time. socrates wonders at their reluctance. let
them regard him rather as the swan, who, having sung the praises of
apollo all his life long, sings at his death more lustily than ever.
simmias acknowledges that there is cowardice in not probing truth to the
bottom. 'and if truth divine and inspired is not to be had, then let
a man take the best of human notions, and upon this frail bark let him
sail through life.' he proceeds to state his difficulty: it has been
argued that the soul is invisible and incorporeal, and therefore
immortal, and prior to the body. but is not the soul acknowledged to
be a harmony, and has she not the same relation to the body, as the
harmony--which like her is invisible--has to the lyre? and yet the
harmony does not survive the lyre. cebes has also an objection, which
like simmias he expresses in a figure. he is willing to admit that the
soul is more lasting than the body. but the more lasting nature of the
soul does not prove her immortality; for after having worn out many
bodies in a single life, and many more in successive births and
deaths, she may at last perish, or, as socrates afterwards restates the
objection, the very act of birth may be the beginning of her death, and
her last body may survive her, just as the coat of an old weaver is left
behind him after he is dead, although a man is more lasting than his
coat. and he who would prove the immortality of the soul, must prove not
only that the soul outlives one or many bodies, but that she outlives
them all.

the audience, like the chorus in a play, for a moment interpret the
feelings of the actors; there is a temporary depression, and then the
enquiry is resumed. it is a melancholy reflection that arguments, like
men, are apt to be deceivers; and those who have been often deceived
become distrustful both of arguments and of friends. but this
unfortunate experience should not make us either haters of men or haters
of arguments. the want of health and truth is not in the argument, but
in ourselves. socrates, who is about to die, is sensible of his own
weakness; he desires to be impartial, but he cannot help feeling that he
has too great an interest in the truth of the argument. and therefore he
would have his friends examine and refute him, if they think that he is
in error.

at his request simmias and cebes repeat their objections. they do not
go to the length of denying the pre-existence of ideas. simmias is of
opinion that the soul is a harmony of the body. but the admission of the
pre-existence of ideas, and therefore of the soul, is at variance with
this. (compare a parallel difficulty in theaet.) for a harmony is
an effect, whereas the soul is not an effect, but a cause; a harmony
follows, but the soul leads; a harmony admits of degrees, and the soul
has no degrees. again, upon the supposition that the soul is a harmony,
why is one soul better than another? are they more or less harmonized,
or is there one harmony within another? but the soul does not admit of
degrees, and cannot therefore be more or less harmonized. further, the
soul is often engaged in resisting the affections of the body, as homer
describes odysseus 'rebuking his heart.' could he have written this
under the idea that the soul is a harmony of the body? nay rather, are
we not contradicting homer and ourselves in affirming anything of the
sort?

the goddess harmonia, as socrates playfully terms the argument of
simmias, has been happily disposed of; and now an answer has to be given
to the theban cadmus. socrates recapitulates the argument of cebes,
which, as he remarks, involves the whole question of natural growth or
causation; about this he proposes to narrate his own mental experience.
when he was young he had puzzled himself with physics: he had enquired
into the growth and decay of animals, and the origin of thought, until
at last he began to doubt the self-evident fact that growth is the
result of eating and drinking; and so he arrived at the conclusion that
he was not meant for such enquiries. nor was he less perplexed with
notions of comparison and number. at first he had imagined himself to
understand differences of greater and less, and to know that ten is two
more than eight, and the like. but now those very notions appeared to
him to contain a contradiction. for how can one be divided into two? or
two be compounded into one? these are difficulties which socrates cannot
answer. of generation and destruction he knows nothing. but he has a
confused notion of another method in which matters of this sort are to
be investigated. (compare republic; charm.)

then he heard some one reading out of a book of anaxagoras, that mind is
the cause of all things. and he said to himself: if mind is the cause
of all things, surely mind must dispose them all for the best. the new
teacher will show me this 'order of the best' in man and nature. how
great had been his hopes and how great his disappointment! for he found
that his new friend was anything but consistent in his use of mind as
a cause, and that he soon introduced winds, waters, and other eccentric
notions. (compare arist. metaph.) it was as if a person had said that
socrates is sitting here because he is made up of bones and muscles,
instead of telling the true reason--that he is here because the
athenians have thought good to sentence him to death, and he has thought
good to await his sentence. had his bones and muscles been left by him
to their own ideas of right, they would long ago have taken themselves
off. but surely there is a great confusion of the cause and condition
in all this. and this confusion also leads people into all sorts of
erroneous theories about the position and motions of the earth. none of
them know how much stronger than any atlas is the power of the best. but
this 'best' is still undiscovered; and in enquiring after the cause, we
can only hope to attain the second best.

now there is a danger in the contemplation of the nature of things, as
there is a danger in looking at the sun during an eclipse, unless the
precaution is taken of looking only at the image reflected in the water,
or in a glass. (compare laws; republic.) 'i was afraid,' says socrates,
'that i might injure the eye of the soul. i thought that i had better
return to the old and safe method of ideas. though i do not mean to say
that he who contemplates existence through the medium of ideas sees
only through a glass darkly, any more than he who contemplates actual
effects.'

if the existence of ideas is granted to him, socrates is of opinion that
he will then have no difficulty in proving the immortality of the soul.
he will only ask for a further admission:--that beauty is the cause of
the beautiful, greatness the cause of the great, smallness of the small,
and so on of other things. this is a safe and simple answer, which
escapes the contradictions of greater and less (greater by reason of
that which is smaller!), of addition and subtraction, and the other
difficulties of relation. these subtleties he is for leaving to wiser
heads than his own; he prefers to test ideas by the consistency of their
consequences, and, if asked to give an account of them, goes back to
some higher idea or hypothesis which appears to him to be the best,
until at last he arrives at a resting-place. (republic; phil.)

the doctrine of ideas, which has long ago received the assent of the
socratic circle, is now affirmed by the phliasian auditor to command
the assent of any man of sense. the narrative is continued; socrates is
desirous of explaining how opposite ideas may appear to co-exist but do
not really co-exist in the same thing or person. for example, simmias
may be said to have greatness and also smallness, because he is greater
than socrates and less than phaedo. and yet simmias is not really great
and also small, but only when compared to phaedo and socrates. i use the
illustration, says socrates, because i want to show you not only that
ideal opposites exclude one another, but also the opposites in us. i,
for example, having the attribute of smallness remain small, and cannot
become great: the smallness which is in me drives out greatness.

one of the company here remarked that this was inconsistent with the
old assertion that opposites generated opposites. but that, replies
socrates, was affirmed, not of opposite ideas either in us or in
nature, but of opposition in the concrete--not of life and death, but
of individuals living and dying. when this objection has been removed,
socrates proceeds: this doctrine of the mutual exclusion of opposites
is not only true of the opposites themselves, but of things which are
inseparable from them. for example, cold and heat are opposed; and fire,
which is inseparable from heat, cannot co-exist with cold, or snow,
which is inseparable from cold, with heat. again, the number three
excludes the number four, because three is an odd number and four is
an even number, and the odd is opposed to the even. thus we are able to
proceed a step beyond 'the safe and simple answer.' we may say, not
only that the odd excludes the even, but that the number three, which
participates in oddness, excludes the even. and in like manner, not only
does life exclude death, but the soul, of which life is the inseparable
attribute, also excludes death. and that of which life is the
inseparable attribute is by the force of the terms imperishable. if the
odd principle were imperishable, then the number three would not perish
but remove, on the approach of the even principle. but the immortal is
imperishable; and therefore the soul on the approach of death does not
perish but removes.

thus all objections appear to be finally silenced. and now the
application has to be made: if the soul is immortal, 'what manner of
persons ought we to be?' having regard not only to time but to eternity.
for death is not the end of all, and the wicked is not released from his
evil by death; but every one carries with him into the world below that
which he is or has become, and that only.

for after death the soul is carried away to judgment, and when she has
received her punishment returns to earth in the course of ages. the wise
soul is conscious of her situation, and follows the attendant angel who
guides her through the windings of the world below; but the impure soul
wanders hither and thither without companion or guide, and is carried
at last to her own place, as the pure soul is also carried away to hers.
'in order that you may understand this, i must first describe to you the
nature and conformation of the earth.'

now the whole earth is a globe placed in the centre of the heavens, and
is maintained there by the perfection of balance. that which we call the
earth is only one of many small hollows, wherein collect the mists and
waters and the thick lower air; but the true earth is above, and is in
a finer and subtler element. and if, like birds, we could fly to the
surface of the air, in the same manner that fishes come to the top of
the sea, then we should behold the true earth and the true heaven and
the true stars. our earth is everywhere corrupted and corroded; and even
the land which is fairer than the sea, for that is a mere chaos or waste
of water and mud and sand, has nothing to show in comparison of the
other world. but the heavenly earth is of divers colours, sparkling with
jewels brighter than gold and whiter than any snow, having flowers and
fruits innumerable. and the inhabitants dwell some on the shore of the
sea of air, others in 'islets of the blest,' and they hold converse
with the gods, and behold the sun, moon and stars as they truly are, and
their other blessedness is of a piece with this.

the hollows on the surface of the globe vary in size and shape from that
which we inhabit: but all are connected by passages and perforations in
the interior of the earth. and there is one huge chasm or opening called
tartarus, into which streams of fire and water and liquid mud are ever
flowing; of these small portions find their way to the surface and
form seas and rivers and volcanoes. there is a perpetual inhalation and
exhalation of the air rising and falling as the waters pass into the
depths of the earth and return again, in their course forming lakes
and rivers, but never descending below the centre of the earth; for on
either side the rivers flowing either way are stopped by a precipice.
these rivers are many and mighty, and there are four principal ones,
oceanus, acheron, pyriphlegethon, and cocytus. oceanus is the river
which encircles the earth; acheron takes an opposite direction, and
after flowing under the earth through desert places, at last reaches the
acherusian lake,--this is the river at which the souls of the dead await
their return to earth. pyriphlegethon is a stream of fire, which coils
round the earth and flows into the depths of tartarus. the fourth river,
cocytus, is that which is called by the poets the stygian river, and
passes into and forms the lake styx, from the waters of which it gains
new and strange powers. this river, too, falls into tartarus.

the dead are first of all judged according to their deeds, and those who
are incurable are thrust into tartarus, from which they never come out.
those who have only committed venial sins are first purified of them,
and then rewarded for the good which they have done. those who have
committed crimes, great indeed, but not unpardonable, are thrust
into tartarus, but are cast forth at the end of a year by way of
pyriphlegethon or cocytus, and these carry them as far as the acherusian
lake, where they call upon their victims to let them come out of the
rivers into the lake. and if they prevail, then they are let out and
their sufferings cease: if not, they are borne unceasingly into tartarus
and back again, until they at last obtain mercy. the pure souls also
receive their reward, and have their abode in the upper earth, and a
select few in still fairer 'mansions.'

socrates is not prepared to insist on the literal accuracy of this
description, but he is confident that something of the kind is true.
he who has sought after the pleasures of knowledge and rejected the
pleasures of the body, has reason to be of good hope at the approach of
death; whose voice is already speaking to him, and who will one day be
heard calling all men.

the hour has come at which he must drink the poison, and not much
remains to be done. how shall they bury him? that is a question which he
refuses to entertain, for they are burying, not him, but his dead body.
his friends had once been sureties that he would remain, and they shall
now be sureties that he has run away. yet he would not die without the
customary ceremonies of washing and burial. shall he make a libation of
the poison? in the spirit he will, but not in the letter. one request he
utters in the very act of death, which has been a puzzle to after ages.
with a sort of irony he remembers that a trifling religious duty is
still unfulfilled, just as above he desires before he departs to compose
a few verses in order to satisfy a scruple about a dream--unless,
indeed, we suppose him to mean, that he was now restored to health, and
made the customary offering to asclepius in token of his recovery.

*****

1. the doctrine of the immortality of the soul has sunk deep into
the heart of the human race; and men are apt to rebel against any
examination of the nature or grounds of their belief. they do not like
to acknowledge that this, as well as the other 'eternal ideas; of
man, has a history in time, which may be traced in greek poetry or
philosophy, and also in the hebrew scriptures. they convert feeling into
reasoning, and throw a network of dialectics over that which is really
a deeply-rooted instinct. in the same temper which socrates reproves in
himself they are disposed to think that even fallacies will do no harm,
for they will die with them, and while they live they will gain by the
delusion. and when they consider the numberless bad arguments which have
been pressed into the service of theology, they say, like the companions
of socrates, 'what argument can we ever trust again?' but there is a
better and higher spirit to be gathered from the phaedo, as well as from
the other writings of plato, which says that first principles should
be most constantly reviewed (phaedo and crat.), and that the highest
subjects demand of us the greatest accuracy (republic); also that we
must not become misologists because arguments are apt to be deceivers.

2. in former ages there was a customary rather than a reasoned belief
in the immortality of the soul. it was based on the authority of the
church, on the necessity of such a belief to morality and the order of
society, on the evidence of an historical fact, and also on analogies
and figures of speech which filled up the void or gave an expression
in words to a cherished instinct. the mass of mankind went on their
way busy with the affairs of this life, hardly stopping to think about
another. but in our own day the question has been reopened, and it is
doubtful whether the belief which in the first ages of christianity
was the strongest motive of action can survive the conflict with a
scientific age in which the rules of evidence are stricter and the mind
has become more sensitive to criticism. it has faded into the distance
by a natural process as it was removed further and further from the
historical fact on which it has been supposed to rest. arguments derived
from material things such as the seed and the ear of corn or transitions
in the life of animals from one state of being to another (the chrysalis
and the butterfly) are not 'in pari materia' with arguments from
the visible to the invisible, and are therefore felt to be no longer
applicable. the evidence to the historical fact seems to be weaker than
was once supposed: it is not consistent with itself, and is based upon
documents which are of unknown origin. the immortality of man must be
proved by other arguments than these if it is again to become a living
belief. we must ask ourselves afresh why we still maintain it, and seek
to discover a foundation for it in the nature of god and in the first
principles of morality.

3. at the outset of the discussion we may clear away a confusion. we
certainly do not mean by the immortality of the soul the immortality of
fame, which whether worth having or not can only be ascribed to a very
select class of the whole race of mankind, and even the interest in
these few is comparatively short-lived. to have been a benefactor to the
world, whether in a higher or a lower sphere of life and thought, is a
great thing: to have the reputation of being one, when men have passed
out of the sphere of earthly praise or blame, is hardly worthy of
consideration. the memory of a great man, so far from being immortal,
is really limited to his own generation:--so long as his friends or his
disciples are alive, so long as his books continue to be read, so long
as his political or military successes fill a page in the history of
his country. the praises which are bestowed upon him at his death hardly
last longer than the flowers which are strewed upon his coffin or the
'immortelles' which are laid upon his tomb. literature makes the most
of its heroes, but the true man is well aware that far from enjoying an
immortality of fame, in a generation or two, or even in a much shorter
time, he will be forgotten and the world will get on without him.

4. modern philosophy is perplexed at this whole question, which is
sometimes fairly given up and handed over to the realm of faith. the
perplexity should not be forgotten by us when we attempt to submit the
phaedo of plato to the requirements of logic. for what idea can we form
of the soul when separated from the body? or how can the soul be united
with the body and still be independent? is the soul related to the
body as the ideal to the real, or as the whole to the parts, or as the
subject to the object, or as the cause to the effect, or as the end to
the means? shall we say with aristotle, that the soul is the entelechy
or form of an organized living body? or with plato, that she has a life
of her own? is the pythagorean image of the harmony, or that of the
monad, the truer expression? is the soul related to the body as sight to
the eye, or as the boatman to his boat? (arist. de anim.) and in
another state of being is the soul to be conceived of as vanishing into
infinity, hardly possessing an existence which she can call her own,
as in the pantheistic system of spinoza: or as an individual informing
another body and entering into new relations, but retaining her own
character? (compare gorgias.) or is the opposition of soul and body a
mere illusion, and the true self neither soul nor body, but the union
of the two in the 'i' which is above them? and is death the assertion
of this individuality in the higher nature, and the falling away into
nothingness of the lower? or are we vainly attempting to pass
the boundaries of human thought? the body and the soul seem to be
inseparable, not only in fact, but in our conceptions of them; and any
philosophy which too closely unites them, or too widely separates them,
either in this life or in another, disturbs the balance of human nature.
no thinker has perfectly adjusted them, or been entirely consistent with
himself in describing their relation to one another. nor can we
wonder that plato in the infancy of human thought should have confused
mythology and philosophy, or have mistaken verbal arguments for real
ones.

5. again, believing in the immortality of the soul, we must still
ask the question of socrates, 'what is that which we suppose to be
immortal?' is it the personal and individual element in us, or the
spiritual and universal? is it the principle of knowledge or of
goodness, or the union of the two? is it the mere force of life which is
determined to be, or the consciousness of self which cannot be got rid
of, or the fire of genius which refuses to be extinguished? or is there
a hidden being which is allied to the author of all existence, who is
because he is perfect, and to whom our ideas of perfection give us a
title to belong? whatever answer is given by us to these questions,
there still remains the necessity of allowing the permanence of evil, if
not for ever, at any rate for a time, in order that the wicked 'may not
have too good a bargain.' for the annihilation of evil at death, or the
eternal duration of it, seem to involve equal difficulties in the moral
government of the universe. sometimes we are led by our feelings, rather
than by our reason, to think of the good and wise only as existing in
another life. why should the mean, the weak, the idiot, the infant,
the herd of men who have never in any proper sense the use of reason,
reappear with blinking eyes in the light of another world? but our
second thought is that the hope of humanity is a common one, and that
all or none will be partakers of immortality. reason does not allow us
to suppose that we have any greater claims than others, and experience
may often reveal to us unexpected flashes of the higher nature in
those whom we had despised. why should the wicked suffer any more than
ourselves? had we been placed in their circumstances should we have been
any better than they? the worst of men are objects of pity rather than
of anger to the philanthropist; must they not be equally such to divine
benevolence? even more than the good they have need of another life; not
that they may be punished, but that they may be educated. these are
a few of the reflections which arise in our minds when we attempt to
assign any form to our conceptions of a future state.

there are some other questions which are disturbing to us because we
have no answer to them. what is to become of the animals in a future
state? have we not seen dogs more faithful and intelligent than men,
and men who are more stupid and brutal than any animals? does their life
cease at death, or is there some 'better thing reserved' also for
them? they may be said to have a shadow or imitation of morality, and
imperfect moral claims upon the benevolence of man and upon the justice
of god. we cannot think of the least or lowest of them, the insect, the
bird, the inhabitants of the sea or the desert, as having any place in
a future world, and if not all, why should those who are specially
attached to man be deemed worthy of any exceptional privilege? when we
reason about such a subject, almost at once we degenerate into nonsense.
it is a passing thought which has no real hold on the mind. we may argue
for the existence of animals in a future state from the attributes of
god, or from texts of scripture ('are not two sparrows sold for one
farthing?' etc.), but the truth is that we are only filling up the void
of another world with our own fancies. again, we often talk about
the origin of evil, that great bugbear of theologians, by which they
frighten us into believing any superstition. what answer can be made
to the old commonplace, 'is not god the author of evil, if he knowingly
permitted, but could have prevented it?' even if we assume that the
inequalities of this life are rectified by some transposition of human
beings in another, still the existence of the very least evil if it
could have been avoided, seems to be at variance with the love and
justice of god. and so we arrive at the conclusion that we are carrying
logic too far, and that the attempt to frame the world according to a
rule of divine perfection is opposed to experience and had better be
given up. the case of the animals is our own. we must admit that the
divine being, although perfect himself, has placed us in a state of life
in which we may work together with him for good, but we are very far
from having attained to it.

6. again, ideas must be given through something; and we are always prone
to argue about the soul from analogies of outward things which may serve
to embody our thoughts, but are also partly delusive. for we cannot
reason from the natural to the spiritual, or from the outward to the
inward. the progress of physiological science, without bringing us
nearer to the great secret, has tended to remove some erroneous notions
respecting the relations of body and mind, and in this we have the
advantage of the ancients. but no one imagines that any seed of
immortality is to be discerned in our mortal frames. most people have
been content to rest their belief in another life on the agreement of
the more enlightened part of mankind, and on the inseparable connection
of such a doctrine with the existence of a god--also in a less degree
on the impossibility of doubting about the continued existence of those
whom we love and reverence in this world. and after all has been
said, the figure, the analogy, the argument, are felt to be only
approximations in different forms to an expression of the common
sentiment of the human heart. that we shall live again is far more
certain than that we shall take any particular form of life.

7. when we speak of the immortality of the soul, we must ask further
what we mean by the word immortality. for of the duration of a living
being in countless ages we can form no conception; far less than a three
years' old child of the whole of life. the naked eye might as well try
to see the furthest star in the infinity of heaven. whether time and
space really exist when we take away the limits of them may be doubted;
at any rate the thought of them when unlimited us so overwhelming to us
as to lose all distinctness. philosophers have spoken of them as forms
of the human mind, but what is the mind without them? as then infinite
time, or an existence out of time, which are the only possible
explanations of eternal duration, are equally inconceivable to us, let
us substitute for them a hundred or a thousand years after death, and
ask not what will be our employment in eternity, but what will happen to
us in that definite portion of time; or what is now happening to those
who passed out of life a hundred or a thousand years ago. do we imagine
that the wicked are suffering torments, or that the good are singing the
praises of god, during a period longer than that of a whole life, or
of ten lives of men? is the suffering physical or mental? and does the
worship of god consist only of praise, or of many forms of service? who
are the wicked, and who are the good, whom we venture to divide by a
hard and fast line; and in which of the two classes should we place
ourselves and our friends? may we not suspect that we are making
differences of kind, because we are unable to imagine differences
of degree?--putting the whole human race into heaven or hell for the
greater convenience of logical division? are we not at the same time
describing them both in superlatives, only that we may satisfy the
demands of rhetoric? what is that pain which does not become deadened
after a thousand years? or what is the nature of that pleasure or
happiness which never wearies by monotony? earthly pleasures and pains
are short in proportion as they are keen; of any others which are both
intense and lasting we have no experience, and can form no idea.
the words or figures of speech which we use are not consistent with
themselves. for are we not imagining heaven under the similitude of
a church, and hell as a prison, or perhaps a madhouse or chamber of
horrors? and yet to beings constituted as we are, the monotony of
singing psalms would be as great an infliction as the pains of hell,
and might be even pleasantly interrupted by them. where are the actions
worthy of rewards greater than those which are conferred on the greatest
benefactors of mankind? and where are the crimes which according to
plato's merciful reckoning,--more merciful, at any rate, than the
eternal damnation of so-called christian teachers,--for every ten years
in this life deserve a hundred of punishment in the life to come?
we should be ready to die of pity if we could see the least of the
sufferings which the writers of infernos and purgatorios have attributed
to the damned. yet these joys and terrors seem hardly to exercise an
appreciable influence over the lives of men. the wicked man when old,
is not, as plato supposes (republic), more agitated by the terrors of
another world when he is nearer to them, nor the good in an ecstasy at
the joys of which he is soon to be the partaker. age numbs the sense of
both worlds; and the habit of life is strongest in death. even the dying
mother is dreaming of her lost children as they were forty or fifty
years before, 'pattering over the boards,' not of reunion with them
in another state of being. most persons when the last hour comes are
resigned to the order of nature and the will of god. they are not
thinking of dante's inferno or paradiso, or of the pilgrim's progress.
heaven and hell are not realities to them, but words or ideas; the
outward symbols of some great mystery, they hardly know what. many
noble poems and pictures have been suggested by the traditional
representations of them, which have been fixed in forms of art and can
no longer be altered. many sermons have been filled with descriptions
of celestial or infernal mansions. but hardly even in childhood did the
thought of heaven and hell supply the motives of our actions, or at any
time seriously affect the substance of our belief.

8. another life must be described, if at all, in forms of thought
and not of sense. to draw pictures of heaven and hell, whether in the
language of scripture or any other, adds nothing to our real knowledge,
but may perhaps disguise our ignorance. the truest conception which
we can form of a future life is a state of progress or education--a
progress from evil to good, from ignorance to knowledge. to this we are
led by the analogy of the present life, in which we see different races
and nations of men, and different men and women of the same nation,
in various states or stages of cultivation; some more and some less
developed, and all of them capable of improvement under favourable
circumstances. there are punishments too of children when they are
growing up inflicted by their parents, of elder offenders which are
imposed by the law of the land, of all men at all times of life,
which are attached by the laws of nature to the performance of certain
actions. all these punishments are really educational; that is to say,
they are not intended to retaliate on the offender, but to teach him
a lesson. also there is an element of chance in them, which is another
name for our ignorance of the laws of nature. there is evil too
inseparable from good (compare lysis); not always punished here, as good
is not always rewarded. it is capable of being indefinitely diminished;
and as knowledge increases, the element of chance may more and more
disappear.

for we do not argue merely from the analogy of the present state of this
world to another, but from the analogy of a probable future to which we
are tending. the greatest changes of which we have had experience as yet
are due to our increasing knowledge of history and of nature. they
have been produced by a few minds appearing in three or four favoured
nations, in a comparatively short period of time. may we be allowed to
imagine the minds of men everywhere working together during many ages
for the completion of our knowledge? may not the science of physiology
transform the world? again, the majority of mankind have really
experienced some moral improvement; almost every one feels that he has
tendencies to good, and is capable of becoming better. and these germs
of good are often found to be developed by new circumstances, like
stunted trees when transplanted to a better soil. the differences
between the savage and the civilized man, or between the civilized
man in old and new countries, may be indefinitely increased. the first
difference is the effect of a few thousand, the second of a few hundred
years. we congratulate ourselves that slavery has become industry;
that law and constitutional government have superseded despotism and
violence; that an ethical religion has taken the place of fetichism.
there may yet come a time when the many may be as well off as the few;
when no one will be weighed down by excessive toil; when the necessity
of providing for the body will not interfere with mental improvement;
when the physical frame may be strengthened and developed; and the
religion of all men may become a reasonable service.

nothing therefore, either in the present state of man or in the
tendencies of the future, as far as we can entertain conjecture of them,
would lead us to suppose that god governs us vindictively in this
world, and therefore we have no reason to infer that he will govern us
vindictively in another. the true argument from analogy is not, 'this
life is a mixed state of justice and injustice, of great waste, of
sudden casualties, of disproportionate punishments, and therefore the
like inconsistencies, irregularities, injustices are to be expected
in another;' but 'this life is subject to law, and is in a state of
progress, and therefore law and progress may be believed to be the
governing principles of another.' all the analogies of this world would
be against unmeaning punishments inflicted a hundred or a thousand years
after an offence had been committed. suffering there might be as a
part of education, but not hopeless or protracted; as there might be
a retrogression of individuals or of bodies of men, yet not such as to
interfere with a plan for the improvement of the whole (compare laws.)

9. but some one will say: that we cannot reason from the seen to the
unseen, and that we are creating another world after the image of this,
just as men in former ages have created gods in their own likeness. and
we, like the companions of socrates, may feel discouraged at hearing
our favourite 'argument from analogy' thus summarily disposed of. like
himself, too, we may adduce other arguments in which he seems to have
anticipated us, though he expresses them in different language. for we
feel that the soul partakes of the ideal and invisible; and can never
fall into the error of confusing the external circumstances of man with
his higher self; or his origin with his nature. it is as repugnant to
us as it was to him to imagine that our moral ideas are to be attributed
only to cerebral forces. the value of a human soul, like the value of a
man's life to himself, is inestimable, and cannot be reckoned in earthly
or material things. the human being alone has the consciousness of truth
and justice and love, which is the consciousness of god. and the soul
becoming more conscious of these, becomes more conscious of her own
immortality.

10. the last ground of our belief in immortality, and the strongest, is
the perfection of the divine nature. the mere fact of the existence of
god does not tend to show the continued existence of man. an evil god
or an indifferent god might have had the power, but not the will, to
preserve us. he might have regarded us as fitted to minister to his
service by a succession of existences,--like the animals, without
attributing to each soul an incomparable value. but if he is perfect,
he must will that all rational beings should partake of that perfection
which he himself is. in the words of the timaeus, he is good, and
therefore he desires that all other things should be as like himself as
possible. and the manner in which he accomplishes this is by permitting
evil, or rather degrees of good, which are otherwise called evil.
for all progress is good relatively to the past, and yet may be
comparatively evil when regarded in the light of the future. good and
evil are relative terms, and degrees of evil are merely the negative
aspect of degrees of good. of the absolute goodness of any finite nature
we can form no conception; we are all of us in process of transition
from one degree of good or evil to another. the difficulties which
are urged about the origin or existence of evil are mere dialectical
puzzles, standing in the same relation to christian philosophy as the
puzzles of the cynics and megarians to the philosophy of plato. they
arise out of the tendency of the human mind to regard good and evil both
as relative and absolute; just as the riddles about motion are to be
explained by the double conception of space or matter, which the human
mind has the power of regarding either as continuous or discrete.

in speaking of divine perfection, we mean to say that god is just and
true and loving, the author of order and not of disorder, of good and
not of evil. or rather, that he is justice, that he is truth, that he
is love, that he is order, that he is the very progress of which we were
speaking; and that wherever these qualities are present, whether in the
human soul or in the order of nature, there is god. we might still see
him everywhere, if we had not been mistakenly seeking for him apart from
us, instead of in us; away from the laws of nature, instead of in
them. and we become united to him not by mystical absorption, but by
partaking, whether consciously or unconsciously, of that truth and
justice and love which he himself is.

thus the belief in the immortality of the soul rests at last on the
belief in god. if there is a good and wise god, then there is a progress
of mankind towards perfection; and if there is no progress of men
towards perfection, then there is no good and wise god. we cannot
suppose that the moral government of god of which we see the beginnings
in the world and in ourselves will cease when we pass out of life.

11. considering the 'feebleness of the human faculties and the
uncertainty of the subject,' we are inclined to believe that the fewer
our words the better. at the approach of death there is not much said;
good men are too honest to go out of the world professing more than they
know. there is perhaps no important subject about which, at any time,
even religious people speak so little to one another. in the fulness
of life the thought of death is mostly awakened by the sight or
recollection of the death of others rather than by the prospect of our
own. we must also acknowledge that there are degrees of the belief in
immortality, and many forms in which it presents itself to the mind.
some persons will say no more than that they trust in god, and that they
leave all to him. it is a great part of true religion not to pretend
to know more than we do. others when they quit this world are comforted
with the hope 'that they will see and know their friends in heaven.' but
it is better to leave them in the hands of god and to be assured that
'no evil shall touch them.' there are others again to whom the belief in
a divine personality has ceased to have any longer a meaning; yet they
are satisfied that the end of all is not here, but that something still
remains to us, 'and some better thing for the good than for the evil.'
they are persuaded, in spite of their theological nihilism, that the
ideas of justice and truth and holiness and love are realities. they
cherish an enthusiastic devotion to the first principles of morality.
through these they see, or seem to see, darkly, and in a figure, that
the soul is immortal.

but besides differences of theological opinion which must ever prevail
about things unseen, the hope of immortality is weaker or stronger in
men at one time of life than at another; it even varies from day to day.
it comes and goes; the mind, like the sky, is apt to be overclouded.
other generations of men may have sometimes lived under an 'eclipse of
faith,' to us the total disappearance of it might be compared to the
'sun falling from heaven.' and we may sometimes have to begin again and
acquire the belief for ourselves; or to win it back again when it is
lost. it is really weakest in the hour of death. for nature, like a kind
mother or nurse, lays us to sleep without frightening us; physicians,
who are the witnesses of such scenes, say that under ordinary
circumstances there is no fear of the future. often, as plato tells
us, death is accompanied 'with pleasure.' (tim.) when the end is still
uncertain, the cry of many a one has been, 'pray, that i may be taken.'
the last thoughts even of the best men depend chiefly on the accidents
of their bodily state. pain soon overpowers the desire of life; old age,
like the child, is laid to sleep almost in a moment. the long experience
of life will often destroy the interest which mankind have in it. so
various are the feelings with which different persons draw near to
death; and still more various the forms in which imagination clothes it.
for this alternation of feeling compare the old testament,--psalm vi.;
isaiah; eccles.

12. when we think of god and of man in his relation to god; of the
imperfection of our present state and yet of the progress which is
observable in the history of the world and of the human mind; of the
depth and power of our moral ideas which seem to partake of the very
nature of god himself; when we consider the contrast between the
physical laws to which we are subject and the higher law which raises us
above them and is yet a part of them; when we reflect on our capacity of
becoming the 'spectators of all time and all existence,' and of framing
in our own minds the ideal of a perfect being; when we see how the
human mind in all the higher religions of the world, including buddhism,
notwithstanding some aberrations, has tended towards such a belief--we
have reason to think that our destiny is different from that of animals;
and though we cannot altogether shut out the childish fear that the soul
upon leaving the body may 'vanish into thin air,' we have still, so far
as the nature of the subject admits, a hope of immortality with which we
comfort ourselves on sufficient grounds. the denial of the belief takes
the heart out of human life; it lowers men to the level of the material.
as goethe also says, 'he is dead even in this world who has no belief in
another.'

13. it is well also that we should sometimes think of the forms of
thought under which the idea of immortality is most naturally presented
to us. it is clear that to our minds the risen soul can no longer be
described, as in a picture, by the symbol of a creature half-bird,
half-human, nor in any other form of sense. the multitude of angels, as
in milton, singing the almighty's praises, are a noble image, and may
furnish a theme for the poet or the painter, but they are no longer an
adequate expression of the kingdom of god which is within us. neither is
there any mansion, in this world or another, in which the departed can
be imagined to dwell and carry on their occupations. when this earthly
tabernacle is dissolved, no other habitation or building can take them
in: it is in the language of ideas only that we speak of them.

first of all there is the thought of rest and freedom from pain; they
have gone home, as the common saying is, and the cares of this world
touch them no more. secondly, we may imagine them as they were at
their best and brightest, humbly fulfilling their daily round of
duties--selfless, childlike, unaffected by the world; when the eye was
single and the whole body seemed to be full of light; when the mind was
clear and saw into the purposes of god. thirdly, we may think of them
as possessed by a great love of god and man, working out his will at a
further stage in the heavenly pilgrimage. and yet we acknowledge that
these are the things which eye hath not seen nor ear heard and therefore
it hath not entered into the heart of man in any sensible manner to
conceive them. fourthly, there may have been some moments in our own
lives when we have risen above ourselves, or been conscious of our truer
selves, in which the will of god has superseded our wills, and we have
entered into communion with him, and been partakers for a brief season
of the divine truth and love, in which like christ we have been inspired
to utter the prayer, 'i in them, and thou in me, that we may be all made
perfect in one.' these precious moments, if we have ever known them, are
the nearest approach which we can make to the idea of immortality.

14. returning now to the earlier stage of human thought which is
represented by the writings of plato, we find that many of the
same questions have already arisen: there is the same tendency to
materialism; the same inconsistency in the application of the idea of
mind; the same doubt whether the soul is to be regarded as a cause or as
an effect; the same falling back on moral convictions. in the phaedo the
soul is conscious of her divine nature, and the separation from the body
which has been commenced in this life is perfected in another. beginning
in mystery, socrates, in the intermediate part of the dialogue, attempts
to bring the doctrine of a future life into connection with his theory
of knowledge. in proportion as he succeeds in this, the individual seems
to disappear in a more general notion of the soul; the contemplation of
ideas 'under the form of eternity' takes the place of past and future
states of existence. his language may be compared to that of some modern
philosophers, who speak of eternity, not in the sense of perpetual
duration of time, but as an ever-present quality of the soul. yet at
the conclusion of the dialogue, having 'arrived at the end of the
intellectual world' (republic), he replaces the veil of mythology,
and describes the soul and her attendant genius in the language of the
mysteries or of a disciple of zoroaster. nor can we fairly demand of
plato a consistency which is wanting among ourselves, who acknowledge
that another world is beyond the range of human thought, and yet are
always seeking to represent the mansions of heaven or hell in
the colours of the painter, or in the descriptions of the poet or
rhetorician.

15. the doctrine of the immortality of the soul was not new to the
greeks in the age of socrates, but, like the unity of god, had a
foundation in the popular belief. the old homeric notion of a gibbering
ghost flitting away to hades; or of a few illustrious heroes enjoying
the isles of the blest; or of an existence divided between the two; or
the hesiodic, of righteous spirits, who become guardian angels,--had
given place in the mysteries and the orphic poets to representations,
partly fanciful, of a future state of rewards and punishments. (laws.)
the reticence of the greeks on public occasions and in some part of
their literature respecting this 'underground' religion, is not to be
taken as a measure of the diffusion of such beliefs. if pericles in the
funeral oration is silent on the consolations of immortality, the
poet pindar and the tragedians on the other hand constantly assume the
continued existence of the dead in an upper or under world. darius
and laius are still alive; antigone will be dear to her brethren after
death; the way to the palace of cronos is found by those who 'have
thrice departed from evil.' the tragedy of the greeks is not 'rounded'
by this life, but is deeply set in decrees of fate and mysterious
workings of powers beneath the earth. in the caricature of aristophanes
there is also a witness to the common sentiment. the ionian and
pythagorean philosophies arose, and some new elements were added to the
popular belief. the individual must find an expression as well as the
world. either the soul was supposed to exist in the form of a magnet, or
of a particle of fire, or of light, or air, or water; or of a number or
of a harmony of number; or to be or have, like the stars, a principle
of motion (arist. de anim.). at length anaxagoras, hardly distinguishing
between life and mind, or between mind human and divine, attained
the pure abstraction; and this, like the other abstractions of greek
philosophy, sank deep into the human intelligence. the opposition of
the intelligible and the sensible, and of god to the world, supplied an
analogy which assisted in the separation of soul and body. if ideas were
separable from phenomena, mind was also separable from matter; if the
ideas were eternal, the mind that conceived them was eternal too. as
the unity of god was more distinctly acknowledged, the conception of the
human soul became more developed. the succession, or alternation of
life and death, had occurred to heracleitus. the eleatic parmenides had
stumbled upon the modern thesis, that 'thought and being are the same.'
the eastern belief in transmigration defined the sense of individuality;
and some, like empedocles, fancied that the blood which they had shed
in another state of being was crying against them, and that for thirty
thousand years they were to be 'fugitives and vagabonds upon the earth.'
the desire of recognizing a lost mother or love or friend in the world
below (phaedo) was a natural feeling which, in that age as well as in
every other, has given distinctness to the hope of immortality. nor were
ethical considerations wanting, partly derived from the necessity of
punishing the greater sort of criminals, whom no avenging power of this
world could reach. the voice of conscience, too, was heard reminding
the good man that he was not altogether innocent. (republic.) to these
indistinct longings and fears an expression was given in the mysteries
and orphic poets: a 'heap of books' (republic), passing under the names
of musaeus and orpheus in plato's time, were filled with notions of an
under-world.

16. yet after all the belief in the individuality of the soul after
death had but a feeble hold on the greek mind. like the personality of
god, the personality of man in a future state was not inseparably bound
up with the reality of his existence. for the distinction between the
personal and impersonal, and also between the divine and human, was far
less marked to the greek than to ourselves. and as plato readily passes
from the notion of the good to that of god, he also passes almost
imperceptibly to himself and his reader from the future life of the
individual soul to the eternal being of the absolute soul. there has
been a clearer statement and a clearer denial of the belief in modern
times than is found in early greek philosophy, and hence the comparative
silence on the whole subject which is often remarked in ancient writers,
and particularly in aristotle. for plato and aristotle are not further
removed in their teaching about the immortality of the soul than they
are in their theory of knowledge.

17. living in an age when logic was beginning to mould human thought,
plato naturally cast his belief in immortality into a logical form. and
when we consider how much the doctrine of ideas was also one of words,
it is not surprising that he should have fallen into verbal fallacies:
early logic is always mistaking the truth of the form for the truth of
the matter. it is easy to see that the alternation of opposites is
not the same as the generation of them out of each other; and that the
generation of them out of each other, which is the first argument in
the phaedo, is at variance with their mutual exclusion of each other,
whether in themselves or in us, which is the last. for even if we admit
the distinction which he draws between the opposites and the things
which have the opposites, still individuals fall under the latter class;
and we have to pass out of the region of human hopes and fears to a
conception of an abstract soul which is the impersonation of the ideas.
such a conception, which in plato himself is but half expressed, is
unmeaning to us, and relative only to a particular stage in the history
of thought. the doctrine of reminiscence is also a fragment of a former
world, which has no place in the philosophy of modern times. but plato
had the wonders of psychology just opening to him, and he had not the
explanation of them which is supplied by the analysis of language and
the history of the human mind. the question, 'whence come our abstract
ideas?' he could only answer by an imaginary hypothesis. nor is it
difficult to see that his crowning argument is purely verbal, and is
but the expression of an instinctive confidence put into a logical
form:--'the soul is immortal because it contains a principle of
imperishableness.' nor does he himself seem at all to be aware that
nothing is added to human knowledge by his 'safe and simple answer,'
that beauty is the cause of the beautiful; and that he is merely
reasserting the eleatic being 'divided by the pythagorean numbers,'
against the heracleitean doctrine of perpetual generation. the answer to
the 'very serious question' of generation and destruction is really
the denial of them. for this he would substitute, as in the republic, a
system of ideas, tested, not by experience, but by their consequences,
and not explained by actual causes, but by a higher, that is, a more
general notion. consistency with themselves is the only test which is to
be applied to them. (republic, and phaedo.)

18. to deal fairly with such arguments, they should be translated as
far as possible into their modern equivalents. 'if the ideas of men are
eternal, their souls are eternal, and if not the ideas, then not the
souls.' such an argument stands nearly in the same relation to plato and
his age, as the argument from the existence of god to immortality among
ourselves. 'if god exists, then the soul exists after death; and if
there is no god, there is no existence of the soul after death.' for
the ideas are to his mind the reality, the truth, the principle of
permanence, as well as of intelligence and order in the world. when
simmias and cebes say that they are more strongly persuaded of the
existence of ideas than they are of the immortality of the soul, they
represent fairly enough the order of thought in greek philosophy. and we
might say in the same way that we are more certain of the existence
of god than we are of the immortality of the soul, and are led by the
belief in the one to a belief in the other. the parallel, as socrates
would say, is not perfect, but agrees in as far as the mind in either
case is regarded as dependent on something above and beyond herself. the
analogy may even be pressed a step further: 'we are more certain of our
ideas of truth and right than we are of the existence of god, and
are led on in the order of thought from one to the other.' or more
correctly: 'the existence of right and truth is the existence of god,
and can never for a moment be separated from him.'

19. the main argument of the phaedo is derived from the existence of
eternal ideas of which the soul is a partaker; the other argument of the
alternation of opposites is replaced by this. and there have not been
wanting philosophers of the idealist school who have imagined that the
doctrine of the immortality of the soul is a theory of knowledge, and
that in what has preceded plato is accommodating himself to the popular
belief. such a view can only be elicited from the phaedo by what may
be termed the transcendental method of interpretation, and is obviously
inconsistent with the gorgias and the republic. those who maintain
it are immediately compelled to renounce the shadow which they have
grasped, as a play of words only. but the truth is, that plato in his
argument for the immortality of the soul has collected many elements of
proof or persuasion, ethical and mythological as well as dialectical,
which are not easily to be reconciled with one another; and he is as
much in earnest about his doctrine of retribution, which is repeated
in all his more ethical writings, as about his theory of knowledge.
and while we may fairly translate the dialectical into the language of
hegel, and the religious and mythological into the language of dante or
bunyan, the ethical speaks to us still in the same voice, and appeals to
a common feeling.

20. two arguments of this ethical character occur in the phaedo. the
first may be described as the aspiration of the soul after another state
of being. like the oriental or christian mystic, the philosopher is
seeking to withdraw from impurities of sense, to leave the world and the
things of the world, and to find his higher self. plato recognizes in
these aspirations the foretaste of immortality; as butler and addison in
modern times have argued, the one from the moral tendencies of mankind,
the other from the progress of the soul towards perfection. in using
this argument plato has certainly confused the soul which has left the
body, with the soul of the good and wise. (compare republic.) such a
confusion was natural, and arose partly out of the antithesis of soul
and body. the soul in her own essence, and the soul 'clothed upon' with
virtues and graces, were easily interchanged with one another, because
on a subject which passes expression the distinctions of language can
hardly be maintained.

21. the ethical proof of the immortality of the soul is derived from the
necessity of retribution. the wicked would be too well off if their
evil deeds came to an end. it is not to be supposed that an ardiaeus,
an archelaus, an ismenias could ever have suffered the penalty of
their crimes in this world. the manner in which this retribution is
accomplished plato represents under the figures of mythology. doubtless
he felt that it was easier to improve than to invent, and that in
religion especially the traditional form was required in order to give
verisimilitude to the myth. the myth too is far more probable to that
age than to ours, and may fairly be regarded as 'one guess among
many' about the nature of the earth, which he cleverly supports by the
indications of geology. not that he insists on the absolute truth of
his own particular notions: 'no man of sense will be confident in such
matters; but he will be confident that something of the kind is true.'
as in other passages (gorg., tim., compare crito), he wins belief for
his fictions by the moderation of his statements; he does not, like
dante or swedenborg, allow himself to be deceived by his own creations.

the dialogue must be read in the light of the situation. and first of
all we are struck by the calmness of the scene. like the spectators
at the time, we cannot pity socrates; his mien and his language are
so noble and fearless. he is the same that he ever was, but milder and
gentler, and he has in no degree lost his interest in dialectics;
he will not forego the delight of an argument in compliance with the
jailer's intimation that he should not heat himself with talking. at
such a time he naturally expresses the hope of his life, that he has
been a true mystic and not a mere retainer or wand-bearer: and he refers
to passages of his personal history. to his old enemies the comic
poets, and to the proceedings on the trial, he alludes playfully; but he
vividly remembers the disappointment which he felt in reading the books
of anaxagoras. the return of xanthippe and his children indicates that
the philosopher is not 'made of oak or rock.' some other traits of his
character may be noted; for example, the courteous manner in which
he inclines his head to the last objector, or the ironical touch, 'me
already, as the tragic poet would say, the voice of fate calls;' or
the depreciation of the arguments with which 'he comforted himself and
them;' or his fear of 'misology;' or his references to homer; or the
playful smile with which he 'talks like a book' about greater and less;
or the allusion to the possibility of finding another teacher among
barbarous races (compare polit.); or the mysterious reference to another
science (mathematics?) of generation and destruction for which he is
vainly feeling. there is no change in him; only now he is invested with
a sort of sacred character, as the prophet or priest of apollo the god
of the festival, in whose honour he first of all composes a hymn,
and then like the swan pours forth his dying lay. perhaps the extreme
elevation of socrates above his own situation, and the ordinary
interests of life (compare his jeu d'esprit about his burial, in which
for a moment he puts on the 'silenus mask'), create in the mind of the
reader an impression stronger than could be derived from arguments that
such a one has in him 'a principle which does not admit of death.'

the other persons of the dialogue may be considered under two heads: (1)
private friends; (2) the respondents in the argument.

first there is crito, who has been already introduced to us in the
euthydemus and the crito; he is the equal in years of socrates, and
stands in quite a different relation to him from his younger disciples.
he is a man of the world who is rich and prosperous (compare the jest
in the euthydemus), the best friend of socrates, who wants to know his
commands, in whose presence he talks to his family, and who performs
the last duty of closing his eyes. it is observable too that, as in the
euthydemus, crito shows no aptitude for philosophical discussions. nor
among the friends of socrates must the jailer be forgotten, who seems
to have been introduced by plato in order to show the impression made
by the extraordinary man on the common. the gentle nature of the man
is indicated by his weeping at the announcement of his errand and then
turning away, and also by the words of socrates to his disciples: 'how
charming the man is! since i have been in prison he has been always
coming to me, and is as good as could be to me.' we are reminded
too that he has retained this gentle nature amid scenes of death and
violence by the contrasts which he draws between the behaviour of
socrates and of others when about to die.

another person who takes no part in the philosophical discussion is the
excitable apollodorus, the same who, in the symposium, of which he is
the narrator, is called 'the madman,' and who testifies his grief by the
most violent emotions. phaedo is also present, the 'beloved disciple'
as he may be termed, who is described, if not 'leaning on his bosom,'
as seated next to socrates, who is playing with his hair. he too, like
apollodorus, takes no part in the discussion, but he loves above all
things to hear and speak of socrates after his death. the calmness
of his behaviour, veiling his face when he can no longer restrain
his tears, contrasts with the passionate outcries of the other. at a
particular point the argument is described as falling before the attack
of simmias. a sort of despair is introduced in the minds of the company.
the effect of this is heightened by the description of phaedo, who has
been the eye-witness of the scene, and by the sympathy of his phliasian
auditors who are beginning to think 'that they too can never trust an
argument again.' and the intense interest of the company is communicated
not only to the first auditors, but to us who in a distant country read
the narrative of their emotions after more than two thousand years have
passed away.

the two principal interlocutors are simmias and cebes, the disciples of
philolaus the pythagorean philosopher of thebes. simmias is described
in the phaedrus as fonder of an argument than any man living; and
cebes, although finally persuaded by socrates, is said to be the most
incredulous of human beings. it is cebes who at the commencement of
the dialogue asks why 'suicide is held to be unlawful,' and who
first supplies the doctrine of recollection in confirmation of the
pre-existence of the soul. it is cebes who urges that the pre-existence
does not necessarily involve the future existence of the soul, as is
shown by the illustration of the weaver and his coat. simmias, on the
other hand, raises the question about harmony and the lyre, which is
naturally put into the mouth of a pythagorean disciple. it is simmias,
too, who first remarks on the uncertainty of human knowledge, and
only at last concedes to the argument such a qualified approval as is
consistent with the feebleness of the human faculties. cebes is the
deeper and more consecutive thinker, simmias more superficial and
rhetorical; they are distinguished in much the same manner as adeimantus
and glaucon in the republic.

other persons, menexenus, ctesippus, lysis, are old friends; evenus
has been already satirized in the apology; aeschines and epigenes
were present at the trial; euclid and terpsion will reappear in the
introduction to the theaetetus, hermogenes has already appeared in
the cratylus. no inference can fairly be drawn from the absence of
aristippus, nor from the omission of xenophon, who at the time of
socrates' death was in asia. the mention of plato's own absence seems
like an expression of sorrow, and may, perhaps, be an indication that
the report of the conversation is not to be taken literally.

the place of the dialogue in the series is doubtful. the doctrine of
ideas is certainly carried beyond the socratic point of view; in no
other of the writings of plato is the theory of them so completely
developed. whether the belief in immortality can be attributed to
socrates or not is uncertain; the silence of the memorabilia, and of the
earlier dialogues of plato, is an argument to the contrary. yet in the
cyropaedia xenophon has put language into the mouth of the dying cyrus
which recalls the phaedo, and may have been derived from the teaching of
socrates. it may be fairly urged that the greatest religious interest of
mankind could not have been wholly ignored by one who passed his life in
fulfilling the commands of an oracle, and who recognized a divine plan
in man and nature. (xen. mem.) and the language of the apology and of
the crito confirms this view.

the phaedo is not one of the socratic dialogues of plato; nor, on the
other hand, can it be assigned to that later stage of the platonic
writings at which the doctrine of ideas appears to be forgotten. it
belongs rather to the intermediate period of the platonic philosophy,
which roughly corresponds to the phaedrus, gorgias, republic,
theaetetus. without pretending to determine the real time of their
composition, the symposium, meno, euthyphro, apology, phaedo may be
conveniently read by us in this order as illustrative of the life of
socrates. another chain may be formed of the meno, phaedrus, phaedo,
in which the immortality of the soul is connected with the doctrine of
ideas. in the meno the theory of ideas is based on the ancient belief in
transmigration, which reappears again in the phaedrus as well as in the
republic and timaeus, and in all of them is connected with a doctrine of
retribution. in the phaedrus the immortality of the soul is supposed to
rest on the conception of the soul as a principle of motion, whereas in
the republic the argument turns on the natural continuance of the soul,
which, if not destroyed by her own proper evil, can hardly be destroyed
by any other. the soul of man in the timaeus is derived from the supreme
creator, and either returns after death to her kindred star, or descends
into the lower life of an animal. the apology expresses the same view
as the phaedo, but with less confidence; there the probability of death
being a long sleep is not excluded. the theaetetus also describes, in a
digression, the desire of the soul to fly away and be with god--'and to
fly to him is to be like him.' the symposium may be observed to
resemble as well as to differ from the phaedo. while the first notion of
immortality is only in the way of natural procreation or of posthumous
fame and glory, the higher revelation of beauty, like the good in the
republic, is the vision of the eternal idea. so deeply rooted in
plato's mind is the belief in immortality; so various are the forms of
expression which he employs.

as in several other dialogues, there is more of system in the phaedo
than appears at first sight. the succession of arguments is based on
previous philosophies; beginning with the mysteries and the heracleitean
alternation of opposites, and proceeding to the pythagorean harmony and
transmigration; making a step by the aid of platonic reminiscence, and
a further step by the help of the nous of anaxagoras; until at last we
rest in the conviction that the soul is inseparable from the ideas,
and belongs to the world of the invisible and unknown. then, as in
the gorgias or republic, the curtain falls, and the veil of mythology
descends upon the argument. after the confession of socrates that he is
an interested party, and the acknowledgment that no man of sense will
think the details of his narrative true, but that something of the kind
is true, we return from speculation to practice. he is himself more
confident of immortality than he is of his own arguments; and the
confidence which he expresses is less strong than that which his
cheerfulness and composure in death inspire in us.

difficulties of two kinds occur in the phaedo--one kind to be explained
out of contemporary philosophy, the other not admitting of an entire
solution. (1) the difficulty which socrates says that he experienced in
explaining generation and corruption; the assumption of hypotheses which
proceed from the less general to the more general, and are tested by
their consequences; the puzzle about greater and less; the resort to the
method of ideas, which to us appear only abstract terms,--these are to
be explained out of the position of socrates and plato in the history of
philosophy. they were living in a twilight between the sensible and
the intellectual world, and saw no way of connecting them. they
could neither explain the relation of ideas to phenomena, nor their
correlation to one another. the very idea of relation or comparison was
embarrassing to them. yet in this intellectual uncertainty they had a
conception of a proof from results, and of a moral truth, which remained
unshaken amid the questionings of philosophy. (2) the other is a
difficulty which is touched upon in the republic as well as in the
phaedo, and is common to modern and ancient philosophy. plato is not
altogether satisfied with his safe and simple method of ideas. he wants
to have proved to him by facts that all things are for the best, and
that there is one mind or design which pervades them all. but this
'power of the best' he is unable to explain; and therefore takes refuge
in universal ideas. and are not we at this day seeking to discover that
which socrates in a glass darkly foresaw?

some resemblances to the greek drama may be noted in all the dialogues
of plato. the phaedo is the tragedy of which socrates is the protagonist
and simmias and cebes the secondary performers, standing to them in the
same relation as to glaucon and adeimantus in the republic. no dialogue
has a greater unity of subject and feeling. plato has certainly
fulfilled the condition of greek, or rather of all art, which requires
that scenes of death and suffering should be clothed in beauty. the
gathering of the friends at the commencement of the dialogue, the
dismissal of xanthippe, whose presence would have been out of place at
a philosophical discussion, but who returns again with her children to
take a final farewell, the dejection of the audience at the temporary
overthrow of the argument, the picture of socrates playing with the
hair of phaedo, the final scene in which socrates alone retains his
composure--are masterpieces of art. and the chorus at the end might have
interpreted the feeling of the play: 'there can no evil happen to a good
man in life or death.'

'the art of concealing art' is nowhere more perfect than in those
writings of plato which describe the trial and death of socrates. their
charm is their simplicity, which gives them verisimilitude; and yet
they touch, as if incidentally, and because they were suitable to the
occasion, on some of the deepest truths of philosophy. there is nothing
in any tragedy, ancient or modern, nothing in poetry or history (with
one exception), like the last hours of socrates in plato. the master
could not be more fitly occupied at such a time than in discoursing of
immortality; nor the disciples more divinely consoled. the arguments,
taken in the spirit and not in the letter, are our arguments; and
socrates by anticipation may be even thought to refute some 'eccentric
notions; current in our own age. for there are philosophers among
ourselves who do not seem to understand how much stronger is the power
of intelligence, or of the best, than of atlas, or mechanical force.
how far the words attributed to socrates were actually uttered by him we
forbear to ask; for no answer can be given to this question. and it
is better to resign ourselves to the feeling of a great work, than to
linger among critical uncertainties.




phaedo


persons of the dialogue:

phaedo, who is the narrator of the dialogue to echecrates of phlius.
socrates, apollodorus, simmias, cebes, crito and an attendant of the
prison.

scene: the prison of socrates.

place of the narration: phlius.



echecrates: were you yourself, phaedo, in the prison with socrates on
the day when he drank the poison?

phaedo: yes, echecrates, i was.

echecrates: i should so like to hear about his death. what did he say in
his last hours? we were informed that he died by taking poison, but no
one knew anything more; for no phliasian ever goes to athens now, and it
is a long time since any stranger from athens has found his way hither;
so that we had no clear account.

phaedo: did you not hear of the proceedings at the trial?

echecrates: yes; some one told us about the trial, and we could not
understand why, having been condemned, he should have been put to death,
not at the time, but long afterwards. what was the reason of this?

phaedo: an accident, echecrates: the stern of the ship which the
athenians send to delos happened to have been crowned on the day before
he was tried.

echecrates: what is this ship?

phaedo: it is the ship in which, according to athenian tradition,
theseus went to crete when he took with him the fourteen youths, and was
the saviour of them and of himself. and they were said to have vowed
to apollo at the time, that if they were saved they would send a yearly
mission to delos. now this custom still continues, and the whole period
of the voyage to and from delos, beginning when the priest of apollo
crowns the stern of the ship, is a holy season, during which the city is
not allowed to be polluted by public executions; and when the vessel
is detained by contrary winds, the time spent in going and returning
is very considerable. as i was saying, the ship was crowned on the day
before the trial, and this was the reason why socrates lay in prison and
was not put to death until long after he was condemned.

echecrates: what was the manner of his death, phaedo? what was said or
done? and which of his friends were with him? or did the authorities
forbid them to be present--so that he had no friends near him when he
died?

phaedo: no; there were several of them with him.

echecrates: if you have nothing to do, i wish that you would tell me
what passed, as exactly as you can.

phaedo: i have nothing at all to do, and will try to gratify your wish.
to be reminded of socrates is always the greatest delight to me, whether
i speak myself or hear another speak of him.

echecrates: you will have listeners who are of the same mind with you,
and i hope that you will be as exact as you can.

phaedo: i had a singular feeling at being in his company. for i
could hardly believe that i was present at the death of a friend, and
therefore i did not pity him, echecrates; he died so fearlessly, and
his words and bearing were so noble and gracious, that to me he appeared
blessed. i thought that in going to the other world he could not be
without a divine call, and that he would be happy, if any man ever was,
when he arrived there, and therefore i did not pity him as might have
seemed natural at such an hour. but i had not the pleasure which i
usually feel in philosophical discourse (for philosophy was the theme
of which we spoke). i was pleased, but in the pleasure there was also a
strange admixture of pain; for i reflected that he was soon to die, and
this double feeling was shared by us all; we were laughing and weeping
by turns, especially the excitable apollodorus--you know the sort of
man?

echecrates: yes.

phaedo: he was quite beside himself; and i and all of us were greatly
moved.

echecrates: who were present?

phaedo: of native athenians there were, besides apollodorus, critobulus
and his father crito, hermogenes, epigenes, aeschines, antisthenes;
likewise ctesippus of the deme of paeania, menexenus, and some others;
plato, if i am not mistaken, was ill.

echecrates: were there any strangers?

phaedo: yes, there were; simmias the theban, and cebes, and phaedondes;
euclid and terpison, who came from megara.

echecrates: and was aristippus there, and cleombrotus?

phaedo: no, they were said to be in aegina.

echecrates: any one else?

phaedo: i think that these were nearly all.

echecrates: well, and what did you talk about?

phaedo: i will begin at the beginning, and endeavour to repeat the
entire conversation. on the previous days we had been in the habit of
assembling early in the morning at the court in which the trial took
place, and which is not far from the prison. there we used to wait
talking with one another until the opening of the doors (for they were
not opened very early); then we went in and generally passed the day
with socrates. on the last morning we assembled sooner than usual,
having heard on the day before when we quitted the prison in the evening
that the sacred ship had come from delos, and so we arranged to meet
very early at the accustomed place. on our arrival the jailer who
answered the door, instead of admitting us, came out and told us to stay
until he called us. 'for the eleven,' he said, 'are now with socrates;
they are taking off his chains, and giving orders that he is to die
to-day.' he soon returned and said that we might come in. on entering we
found socrates just released from chains, and xanthippe, whom you know,
sitting by him, and holding his child in her arms. when she saw us she
uttered a cry and said, as women will: 'o socrates, this is the last
time that either you will converse with your friends, or they with you.'
socrates turned to crito and said: 'crito, let some one take her home.'
some of crito's people accordingly led her away, crying out and beating
herself. and when she was gone, socrates, sitting up on the couch, bent
and rubbed his leg, saying, as he was rubbing: how singular is the
thing called pleasure, and how curiously related to pain, which might be
thought to be the opposite of it; for they are never present to a man at
the same instant, and yet he who pursues either is generally compelled
to take the other; their bodies are two, but they are joined by a single
head. and i cannot help thinking that if aesop had remembered them, he
would have made a fable about god trying to reconcile their strife, and
how, when he could not, he fastened their heads together; and this is
the reason why when one comes the other follows, as i know by my own
experience now, when after the pain in my leg which was caused by the
chain pleasure appears to succeed.

upon this cebes said: i am glad, socrates, that you have mentioned the
name of aesop. for it reminds me of a question which has been asked by
many, and was asked of me only the day before yesterday by evenus the
poet--he will be sure to ask it again, and therefore if you would like
me to have an answer ready for him, you may as well tell me what i
should say to him:--he wanted to know why you, who never before wrote
a line of poetry, now that you are in prison are turning aesop's fables
into verse, and also composing that hymn in honour of apollo.

tell him, cebes, he replied, what is the truth--that i had no idea of
rivalling him or his poems; to do so, as i knew, would be no easy task.
but i wanted to see whether i could purge away a scruple which i felt
about the meaning of certain dreams. in the course of my life i have
often had intimations in dreams 'that i should compose music.' the same
dream came to me sometimes in one form, and sometimes in another, but
always saying the same or nearly the same words: 'cultivate and make
music,' said the dream. and hitherto i had imagined that this was only
intended to exhort and encourage me in the study of philosophy, which
has been the pursuit of my life, and is the noblest and best of music.
the dream was bidding me do what i was already doing, in the same way
that the competitor in a race is bidden by the spectators to run when he
is already running. but i was not certain of this, for the dream might
have meant music in the popular sense of the word, and being under
sentence of death, and the festival giving me a respite, i thought that
it would be safer for me to satisfy the scruple, and, in obedience to
the dream, to compose a few verses before i departed. and first i made
a hymn in honour of the god of the festival, and then considering that a
poet, if he is really to be a poet, should not only put together words,
but should invent stories, and that i have no invention, i took some
fables of aesop, which i had ready at hand and which i knew--they were
the first i came upon--and turned them into verse. tell this to evenus,
cebes, and bid him be of good cheer; say that i would have him come
after me if he be a wise man, and not tarry; and that to-day i am likely
to be going, for the athenians say that i must.

simmias said: what a message for such a man! having been a frequent
companion of his i should say that, as far as i know him, he will never
take your advice unless he is obliged.

why, said socrates,--is not evenus a philosopher?

i think that he is, said simmias.

then he, or any man who has the spirit of philosophy, will be willing to
die, but he will not take his own life, for that is held to be unlawful.

here he changed his position, and put his legs off the couch on to the
ground, and during the rest of the conversation he remained sitting.

why do you say, enquired cebes, that a man ought not to take his own
life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow the dying?

socrates replied: and have you, cebes and simmias, who are the disciples
of philolaus, never heard him speak of this?

yes, but his language was obscure, socrates.

my words, too, are only an echo; but there is no reason why i should not
repeat what i have heard: and indeed, as i am going to another place,
it is very meet for me to be thinking and talking of the nature of
the pilgrimage which i am about to make. what can i do better in the
interval between this and the setting of the sun?

then tell me, socrates, why is suicide held to be unlawful? as i have
certainly heard philolaus, about whom you were just now asking, affirm
when he was staying with us at thebes: and there are others who say the
same, although i have never understood what was meant by any of them.

do not lose heart, replied socrates, and the day may come when you will
understand. i suppose that you wonder why, when other things which are
evil may be good at certain times and to certain persons, death is to
be the only exception, and why, when a man is better dead, he is not
permitted to be his own benefactor, but must wait for the hand of
another.

very true, said cebes, laughing gently and speaking in his native
boeotian.

i admit the appearance of inconsistency in what i am saying; but
there may not be any real inconsistency after all. there is a doctrine
whispered in secret that man is a prisoner who has no right to open
the door and run away; this is a great mystery which i do not quite
understand. yet i too believe that the gods are our guardians, and that
we are a possession of theirs. do you not agree?

yes, i quite agree, said cebes.

and if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass, for example, took
the liberty of putting himself out of the way when you had given no
intimation of your wish that he should die, would you not be angry with
him, and would you not punish him if you could?

certainly, replied cebes.

then, if we look at the matter thus, there may be reason in saying that
a man should wait, and not take his own life until god summons him, as
he is now summoning me.

yes, socrates, said cebes, there seems to be truth in what you say. and
yet how can you reconcile this seemingly true belief that god is our
guardian and we his possessions, with the willingness to die which we
were just now attributing to the philosopher? that the wisest of men
should be willing to leave a service in which they are ruled by the gods
who are the best of rulers, is not reasonable; for surely no wise man
thinks that when set at liberty he can take better care of himself than
the gods take of him. a fool may perhaps think so--he may argue that he
had better run away from his master, not considering that his duty is
to remain to the end, and not to run away from the good, and that there
would be no sense in his running away. the wise man will want to be ever
with him who is better than himself. now this, socrates, is the reverse
of what was just now said; for upon this view the wise man should sorrow
and the fool rejoice at passing out of life.

the earnestness of cebes seemed to please socrates. here, said he,
turning to us, is a man who is always inquiring, and is not so easily
convinced by the first thing which he hears.

and certainly, added simmias, the objection which he is now making does
appear to me to have some force. for what can be the meaning of a truly
wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better
than himself? and i rather imagine that cebes is referring to you; he
thinks that you are too ready to leave us, and too ready to leave the
gods whom you acknowledge to be our good masters.

yes, replied socrates; there is reason in what you say. and so you think
that i ought to answer your indictment as if i were in a court?

we should like you to do so, said simmias.

then i must try to make a more successful defence before you than i
did when before the judges. for i am quite ready to admit, simmias and
cebes, that i ought to be grieved at death, if i were not persuaded in
the first place that i am going to other gods who are wise and good (of
which i am as certain as i can be of any such matters), and secondly
(though i am not so sure of this last) to men departed, better than
those whom i leave behind; and therefore i do not grieve as i might have
done, for i have good hope that there is yet something remaining for the
dead, and as has been said of old, some far better thing for the good
than for the evil.

but do you mean to take away your thoughts with you, socrates? said
simmias. will you not impart them to us?--for they are a benefit
in which we too are entitled to share. moreover, if you succeed in
convincing us, that will be an answer to the charge against yourself.

i will do my best, replied socrates. but you must first let me hear what
crito wants; he has long been wishing to say something to me.

only this, socrates, replied crito:--the attendant who is to give you
the poison has been telling me, and he wants me to tell you, that you
are not to talk much, talking, he says, increases heat, and this is
apt to interfere with the action of the poison; persons who excite
themselves are sometimes obliged to take a second or even a third dose.

then, said socrates, let him mind his business and be prepared to give
the poison twice or even thrice if necessary; that is all.

i knew quite well what you would say, replied crito; but i was obliged
to satisfy him.

never mind him, he said.

and now, o my judges, i desire to prove to you that the real philosopher
has reason to be of good cheer when he is about to die, and that after
death he may hope to obtain the greatest good in the other world. and
how this may be, simmias and cebes, i will endeavour to explain. for i
deem that the true votary of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood
by other men; they do not perceive that he is always pursuing death and
dying; and if this be so, and he has had the desire of death all his
life long, why when his time comes should he repine at that which he has
been always pursuing and desiring?

simmias said laughingly: though not in a laughing humour, you have made
me laugh, socrates; for i cannot help thinking that the many when they
hear your words will say how truly you have described philosophers, and
our people at home will likewise say that the life which philosophers
desire is in reality death, and that they have found them out to be
deserving of the death which they desire.

and they are right, simmias, in thinking so, with the exception of the
words 'they have found them out'; for they have not found out either
what is the nature of that death which the true philosopher deserves,
or how he deserves or desires death. but enough of them:--let us discuss
the matter among ourselves: do we believe that there is such a thing as
death?

to be sure, replied simmias.

is it not the separation of soul and body? and to be dead is the
completion of this; when the soul exists in herself, and is released
from the body and the body is released from the soul, what is this but
death?

just so, he replied.

there is another question, which will probably throw light on our
present inquiry if you and i can agree about it:--ought the philosopher
to care about the pleasures--if they are to be called pleasures--of
eating and drinking?

certainly not, answered simmias.

and what about the pleasures of love--should he care for them?

by no means.

and will he think much of the other ways of indulging the body, for
example, the acquisition of costly raiment, or sandals, or other
adornments of the body? instead of caring about them, does he not rather
despise anything more than nature needs? what do you say?

i should say that the true philosopher would despise them.

would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not
with the body? he would like, as far as he can, to get away from the
body and to turn to the soul.

quite true.

in matters of this sort philosophers, above all other men, may be
observed in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the communion of
the body.

very true.

whereas, simmias, the rest of the world are of opinion that to him who
has no sense of pleasure and no part in bodily pleasure, life is not
worth having; and that he who is indifferent about them is as good as
dead.

that is also true.

what again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledge?--is the
body, if invited to share in the enquiry, a hinderer or a helper? i mean
to say, have sight and hearing any truth in them? are they not, as the
poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses? and yet, if even
they are inaccurate and indistinct, what is to be said of the other
senses?--for you will allow that they are the best of them?

certainly, he replied.

then when does the soul attain truth?--for in attempting to consider
anything in company with the body she is obviously deceived.

true.

then must not true existence be revealed to her in thought, if at all?

yes.

and thought is best when the mind is gathered into herself and none of
these things trouble her--neither sounds nor sights nor pain nor any
pleasure,--when she takes leave of the body, and has as little as
possible to do with it, when she has no bodily sense or desire, but is
aspiring after true being?

certainly.

and in this the philosopher dishonours the body; his soul runs away from
his body and desires to be alone and by herself?

that is true.

well, but there is another thing, simmias: is there or is there not an
absolute justice?

assuredly there is.

and an absolute beauty and absolute good?

of course.

but did you ever behold any of them with your eyes?

certainly not.

or did you ever reach them with any other bodily sense?--and i speak not
of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and strength,
and of the essence or true nature of everything. has the reality of them
ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs? or rather, is not
the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made
by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact
conception of the essence of each thing which he considers?

certainly.

and he attains to the purest knowledge of them who goes to each with the
mind alone, not introducing or intruding in the act of thought sight
or any other sense together with reason, but with the very light of the
mind in her own clearness searches into the very truth of each; he who
has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and, so to speak, of the
whole body, these being in his opinion distracting elements which when
they infect the soul hinder her from acquiring truth and knowledge--who,
if not he, is likely to attain the knowledge of true being?

what you say has a wonderful truth in it, socrates, replied simmias.

and when real philosophers consider all these things, will they not be
led to make a reflection which they will express in words something like
the following? 'have we not found,' they will say, 'a path of thought
which seems to bring us and our argument to the conclusion, that while
we are in the body, and while the soul is infected with the evils of the
body, our desire will not be satisfied? and our desire is of the truth.
for the body is a source of endless trouble to us by reason of the mere
requirement of food; and is liable also to diseases which overtake and
impede us in the search after true being: it fills us full of loves, and
lusts, and fears, and fancies of all kinds, and endless foolery, and
in fact, as men say, takes away from us the power of thinking at all.
whence come wars, and fightings, and factions? whence but from the body
and the lusts of the body? wars are occasioned by the love of money, and
money has to be acquired for the sake and in the service of the body;
and by reason of all these impediments we have no time to give to
philosophy; and, last and worst of all, even if we are at leisure and
betake ourselves to some speculation, the body is always breaking in
upon us, causing turmoil and confusion in our enquiries, and so amazing
us that we are prevented from seeing the truth. it has been proved to us
by experience that if we would have pure knowledge of anything we
must be quit of the body--the soul in herself must behold things in
themselves: and then we shall attain the wisdom which we desire, and of
which we say that we are lovers, not while we live, but after death; for
if while in company with the body, the soul cannot have pure knowledge,
one of two things follows--either knowledge is not to be attained at
all, or, if at all, after death. for then, and not till then, the soul
will be parted from the body and exist in herself alone. in this present
life, i reckon that we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we
have the least possible intercourse or communion with the body, and are
not surfeited with the bodily nature, but keep ourselves pure until the
hour when god himself is pleased to release us. and thus having got rid
of the foolishness of the body we shall be pure and hold converse with
the pure, and know of ourselves the clear light everywhere, which is
no other than the light of truth.' for the impure are not permitted to
approach the pure. these are the sort of words, simmias, which the true
lovers of knowledge cannot help saying to one another, and thinking. you
would agree; would you not?

undoubtedly, socrates.

but, o my friend, if this is true, there is great reason to hope that,
going whither i go, when i have come to the end of my journey, i shall
attain that which has been the pursuit of my life. and therefore i go on
my way rejoicing, and not i only, but every other man who believes that
his mind has been made ready and that he is in a manner purified.

certainly, replied simmias.

and what is purification but the separation of the soul from the body,
as i was saying before; the habit of the soul gathering and collecting
herself into herself from all sides out of the body; the dwelling in
her own place alone, as in another life, so also in this, as far as she
can;--the release of the soul from the chains of the body?

very true, he said.

and this separation and release of the soul from the body is termed
death?

to be sure, he said.

and the true philosophers, and they only, are ever seeking to release
the soul. is not the separation and release of the soul from the body
their especial study?

that is true.

and, as i was saying at first, there would be a ridiculous contradiction
in men studying to live as nearly as they can in a state of death, and
yet repining when it comes upon them.

clearly.

and the true philosophers, simmias, are always occupied in the practice
of dying, wherefore also to them least of all men is death terrible.
look at the matter thus:--if they have been in every way the enemies of
the body, and are wanting to be alone with the soul, when this desire of
theirs is granted, how inconsistent would they be if they trembled and
repined, instead of rejoicing at their departure to that place where,
when they arrive, they hope to gain that which in life they desired--and
this was wisdom--and at the same time to be rid of the company of their
enemy. many a man has been willing to go to the world below animated
by the hope of seeing there an earthly love, or wife, or son, and
conversing with them. and will he who is a true lover of wisdom, and is
strongly persuaded in like manner that only in the world below he can
worthily enjoy her, still repine at death? will he not depart with joy?
surely he will, o my friend, if he be a true philosopher. for he will
have a firm conviction that there and there only, he can find wisdom
in her purity. and if this be true, he would be very absurd, as i was
saying, if he were afraid of death.

he would, indeed, replied simmias.

and when you see a man who is repining at the approach of death, is not
his reluctance a sufficient proof that he is not a lover of wisdom, but
a lover of the body, and probably at the same time a lover of either
money or power, or both?

quite so, he replied.

and is not courage, simmias, a quality which is specially characteristic
of the philosopher?

certainly.

there is temperance again, which even by the vulgar is supposed to
consist in the control and regulation of the passions, and in the sense
of superiority to them--is not temperance a virtue belonging to those
only who despise the body, and who pass their lives in philosophy?

most assuredly.

for the courage and temperance of other men, if you will consider them,
are really a contradiction.

how so?

well, he said, you are aware that death is regarded by men in general as
a great evil.

very true, he said.

and do not courageous men face death because they are afraid of yet
greater evils?

that is quite true.

then all but the philosophers are courageous only from fear, and because
they are afraid; and yet that a man should be courageous from fear, and
because he is a coward, is surely a strange thing.

very true.

and are not the temperate exactly in the same case? they are temperate
because they are intemperate--which might seem to be a contradiction,
but is nevertheless the sort of thing which happens with this foolish
temperance. for there are pleasures which they are afraid of losing; and
in their desire to keep them, they abstain from some pleasures, because
they are overcome by others; and although to be conquered by pleasure is
called by men intemperance, to them the conquest of pleasure consists in
being conquered by pleasure. and that is what i mean by saying that, in
a sense, they are made temperate through intemperance.

such appears to be the case.

yet the exchange of one fear or pleasure or pain for another fear or
pleasure or pain, and of the greater for the less, as if they were
coins, is not the exchange of virtue. o my blessed simmias, is there not
one true coin for which all things ought to be exchanged?--and that
is wisdom; and only in exchange for this, and in company with this, is
anything truly bought or sold, whether courage or temperance or justice.
and is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears
or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her?
but the virtue which is made up of these goods, when they are severed
from wisdom and exchanged with one another, is a shadow of virtue only,
nor is there any freedom or health or truth in her; but in the true
exchange there is a purging away of all these things, and temperance,
and justice, and courage, and wisdom herself are the purgation of them.
the founders of the mysteries would appear to have had a real meaning,
and were not talking nonsense when they intimated in a figure long ago
that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiated into the world below
will lie in a slough, but that he who arrives there after initiation and
purification will dwell with the gods. for 'many,' as they say in the
mysteries, 'are the thyrsus-bearers, but few are the mystics,'--meaning,
as i interpret the words, 'the true philosophers.' in the number
of whom, during my whole life, i have been seeking, according to my
ability, to find a place;--whether i have sought in a right way or not,
and whether i have succeeded or not, i shall truly know in a little
while, if god will, when i myself arrive in the other world--such is my
belief. and therefore i maintain that i am right, simmias and cebes,
in not grieving or repining at parting from you and my masters in this
world, for i believe that i shall equally find good masters and friends
in another world. but most men do not believe this saying; if then i
succeed in convincing you by my defence better than i did the athenian
judges, it will be well.

cebes answered: i agree, socrates, in the greater part of what you say.
but in what concerns the soul, men are apt to be incredulous; they fear
that when she has left the body her place may be nowhere, and that on
the very day of death she may perish and come to an end--immediately on
her release from the body, issuing forth dispersed like smoke or air
and in her flight vanishing away into nothingness. if she could only be
collected into herself after she has obtained release from the evils of
which you are speaking, there would be good reason to hope, socrates,
that what you say is true. but surely it requires a great deal of
argument and many proofs to show that when the man is dead his soul yet
exists, and has any force or intelligence.

true, cebes, said socrates; and shall i suggest that we converse a
little of the probabilities of these things?

i am sure, said cebes, that i should greatly like to know your opinion
about them.

i reckon, said socrates, that no one who heard me now, not even if he
were one of my old enemies, the comic poets, could accuse me of idle
talking about matters in which i have no concern:--if you please, then,
we will proceed with the inquiry.

suppose we consider the question whether the souls of men after death
are or are not in the world below. there comes into my mind an ancient
doctrine which affirms that they go from hence into the other world, and
returning hither, are born again from the dead. now if it be true that
the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other
world, for if not, how could they have been born again? and this would
be conclusive, if there were any real evidence that the living are only
born from the dead; but if this is not so, then other arguments will
have to be adduced.

very true, replied cebes.

then let us consider the whole question, not in relation to man only,
but in relation to animals generally, and to plants, and to everything
of which there is generation, and the proof will be easier. are not all
things which have opposites generated out of their opposites? i mean
such things as good and evil, just and unjust--and there are innumerable
other opposites which are generated out of opposites. and i want to show
that in all opposites there is of necessity a similar alternation;
i mean to say, for example, that anything which becomes greater must
become greater after being less.

true.

and that which becomes less must have been once greater and then have
become less.

yes.

and the weaker is generated from the stronger, and the swifter from the
slower.

very true.

and the worse is from the better, and the more just is from the more
unjust.

of course.

and is this true of all opposites? and are we convinced that all of them
are generated out of opposites?

yes.

and in this universal opposition of all things, are there not also two
intermediate processes which are ever going on, from one to the other
opposite, and back again; where there is a greater and a less there is
also an intermediate process of increase and diminution, and that which
grows is said to wax, and that which decays to wane?

yes, he said.

and there are many other processes, such as division and composition,
cooling and heating, which equally involve a passage into and out of one
another. and this necessarily holds of all opposites, even though not
always expressed in words--they are really generated out of one another,
and there is a passing or process from one to the other of them?

very true, he replied.

well, and is there not an opposite of life, as sleep is the opposite of
waking?

true, he said.

and what is it?

death, he answered.

and these, if they are opposites, are generated the one from the other,
and have there their two intermediate processes also?

of course.

now, said socrates, i will analyze one of the two pairs of opposites
which i have mentioned to you, and also its intermediate processes, and
you shall analyze the other to me. one of them i term sleep, the other
waking. the state of sleep is opposed to the state of waking, and out
of sleeping waking is generated, and out of waking, sleeping; and the
process of generation is in the one case falling asleep, and in the
other waking up. do you agree?

i entirely agree.

then, suppose that you analyze life and death to me in the same manner.
is not death opposed to life?

yes.

and they are generated one from the other?

yes.

what is generated from the living?

the dead.

and what from the dead?

i can only say in answer--the living.

then the living, whether things or persons, cebes, are generated from
the dead?

that is clear, he replied.

then the inference is that our souls exist in the world below?

that is true.

and one of the two processes or generations is visible--for surely the
act of dying is visible?

surely, he said.

what then is to be the result? shall we exclude the opposite process?
and shall we suppose nature to walk on one leg only? must we not rather
assign to death some corresponding process of generation?

certainly, he replied.

and what is that process?

return to life.

and return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead
into the world of the living?

quite true.

then here is a new way by which we arrive at the conclusion that the
living come from the dead, just as the dead come from the living; and
this, if true, affords a most certain proof that the souls of the dead
exist in some place out of which they come again.

yes, socrates, he said; the conclusion seems to flow necessarily out of
our previous admissions.

and that these admissions were not unfair, cebes, he said, may be shown,
i think, as follows: if generation were in a straight line only, and
there were no compensation or circle in nature, no turn or return of
elements into their opposites, then you know that all things would at
last have the same form and pass into the same state, and there would be
no more generation of them.

what do you mean? he said.

a simple thing enough, which i will illustrate by the case of sleep,
he replied. you know that if there were no alternation of sleeping
and waking, the tale of the sleeping endymion would in the end have no
meaning, because all other things would be asleep, too, and he would not
be distinguishable from the rest. or if there were composition only,
and no division of substances, then the chaos of anaxagoras would come
again. and in like manner, my dear cebes, if all things which partook
of life were to die, and after they were dead remained in the form
of death, and did not come to life again, all would at last die, and
nothing would be alive--what other result could there be? for if the
living spring from any other things, and they too die, must not all
things at last be swallowed up in death? (but compare republic.)

there is no escape, socrates, said cebes; and to me your argument seems
to be absolutely true.

yes, he said, cebes, it is and must be so, in my opinion; and we have
not been deluded in making these admissions; but i am confident that
there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring
from the dead, and that the souls of the dead are in existence, and that
the good souls have a better portion than the evil.

cebes added: your favorite doctrine, socrates, that knowledge is simply
recollection, if true, also necessarily implies a previous time in
which we have learned that which we now recollect. but this would be
impossible unless our soul had been in some place before existing in the
form of man; here then is another proof of the soul's immortality.

but tell me, cebes, said simmias, interposing, what arguments are urged
in favour of this doctrine of recollection. i am not very sure at the
moment that i remember them.

one excellent proof, said cebes, is afforded by questions. if you put
a question to a person in a right way, he will give a true answer of
himself, but how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right
reason already in him? and this is most clearly shown when he is taken
to a diagram or to anything of that sort. (compare meno.)

but if, said socrates, you are still incredulous, simmias, i would ask
you whether you may not agree with me when you look at the matter
in another way;--i mean, if you are still incredulous as to whether
knowledge is recollection.

incredulous, i am not, said simmias; but i want to have this doctrine
of recollection brought to my own recollection, and, from what cebes has
said, i am beginning to recollect and be convinced; but i should still
like to hear what you were going to say.

this is what i would say, he replied:--we should agree, if i am not
mistaken, that what a man recollects he must have known at some previous
time.

very true.

and what is the nature of this knowledge or recollection? i mean to
ask, whether a person who, having seen or heard or in any way perceived
anything, knows not only that, but has a conception of something
else which is the subject, not of the same but of some other kind of
knowledge, may not be fairly said to recollect that of which he has the
conception?

what do you mean?

i mean what i may illustrate by the following instance:--the knowledge
of a lyre is not the same as the knowledge of a man?

true.

and yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a lyre, or
a garment, or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit of
using? do not they, from knowing the lyre, form in the mind's eye an
image of the youth to whom the lyre belongs? and this is recollection.
in like manner any one who sees simmias may remember cebes; and there
are endless examples of the same thing.

endless, indeed, replied simmias.

and recollection is most commonly a process of recovering that which has
been already forgotten through time and inattention.

very true, he said.

well; and may you not also from seeing the picture of a horse or a
lyre remember a man? and from the picture of simmias, you may be led to
remember cebes?

true.

or you may also be led to the recollection of simmias himself?

quite so.

and in all these cases, the recollection may be derived from things
either like or unlike?

it may be.

and when the recollection is derived from like things, then another
consideration is sure to arise, which is--whether the likeness in any
degree falls short or not of that which is recollected?

very true, he said.

and shall we proceed a step further, and affirm that there is such a
thing as equality, not of one piece of wood or stone with another, but
that, over and above this, there is absolute equality? shall we say so?

say so, yes, replied simmias, and swear to it, with all the confidence
in life.

and do we know the nature of this absolute essence?

to be sure, he said.

and whence did we obtain our knowledge? did we not see equalities of
material things, such as pieces of wood and stones, and gather from
them the idea of an equality which is different from them? for you will
acknowledge that there is a difference. or look at the matter in another
way:--do not the same pieces of wood or stone appear at one time equal,
and at another time unequal?

that is certain.

but are real equals ever unequal? or is the idea of equality the same as
of inequality?

impossible, socrates.

then these (so-called) equals are not the same with the idea of
equality?

i should say, clearly not, socrates.

and yet from these equals, although differing from the idea of equality,
you conceived and attained that idea?

very true, he said.

which might be like, or might be unlike them?

yes.

but that makes no difference; whenever from seeing one thing you
conceived another, whether like or unlike, there must surely have been
an act of recollection?

very true.

but what would you say of equal portions of wood and stone, or other
material equals? and what is the impression produced by them? are they
equals in the same sense in which absolute equality is equal? or do they
fall short of this perfect equality in a measure?

yes, he said, in a very great measure too.

and must we not allow, that when i or any one, looking at any object,
observes that the thing which he sees aims at being some other thing,
but falls short of, and cannot be, that other thing, but is inferior, he
who makes this observation must have had a previous knowledge of that to
which the other, although similar, was inferior?

certainly.

and has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of
absolute equality?

precisely.

then we must have known equality previously to the time when we first
saw the material equals, and reflected that all these apparent equals
strive to attain absolute equality, but fall short of it?

very true.

and we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been known,
and can only be known, through the medium of sight or touch, or of some
other of the senses, which are all alike in this respect?

yes, socrates, as far as the argument is concerned, one of them is the
same as the other.

from the senses then is derived the knowledge that all sensible things
aim at an absolute equality of which they fall short?

yes.

then before we began to see or hear or perceive in any way, we must have
had a knowledge of absolute equality, or we could not have referred to
that standard the equals which are derived from the senses?--for to that
they all aspire, and of that they fall short.

no other inference can be drawn from the previous statements.

and did we not see and hear and have the use of our other senses as soon
as we were born?

certainly.

then we must have acquired the knowledge of equality at some previous
time?

yes.

that is to say, before we were born, i suppose?

true.

and if we acquired this knowledge before we were born, and were born
having the use of it, then we also knew before we were born and at the
instant of birth not only the equal or the greater or the less, but all
other ideas; for we are not speaking only of equality, but of beauty,
goodness, justice, holiness, and of all which we stamp with the name of
essence in the dialectical process, both when we ask and when we answer
questions. of all this we may certainly affirm that we acquired the
knowledge before birth?

we may.

but if, after having acquired, we have not forgotten what in each case
we acquired, then we must always have come into life having knowledge,
and shall always continue to know as long as life lasts--for knowing
is the acquiring and retaining knowledge and not forgetting. is not
forgetting, simmias, just the losing of knowledge?

quite true, socrates.

but if the knowledge which we acquired before birth was lost by us at
birth, and if afterwards by the use of the senses we recovered what
we previously knew, will not the process which we call learning be a
recovering of the knowledge which is natural to us, and may not this be
rightly termed recollection?

very true.

so much is clear--that when we perceive something, either by the help of
sight, or hearing, or some other sense, from that perception we are
able to obtain a notion of some other thing like or unlike which is
associated with it but has been forgotten. whence, as i was saying, one
of two alternatives follows:--either we had this knowledge at birth, and
continued to know through life; or, after birth, those who are said to
learn only remember, and learning is simply recollection.

yes, that is quite true, socrates.

and which alternative, simmias, do you prefer? had we the knowledge at
our birth, or did we recollect the things which we knew previously to
our birth?

i cannot decide at the moment.

at any rate you can decide whether he who has knowledge will or will not
be able to render an account of his knowledge? what do you say?

certainly, he will.

but do you think that every man is able to give an account of these very
matters about which we are speaking?

would that they could, socrates, but i rather fear that to-morrow, at
this time, there will no longer be any one alive who is able to give an
account of them such as ought to be given.

then you are not of opinion, simmias, that all men know these things?

certainly not.

they are in process of recollecting that which they learned before?

certainly.

but when did our souls acquire this knowledge?--not since we were born
as men?

certainly not.

and therefore, previously?

yes.

then, simmias, our souls must also have existed without bodies before
they were in the form of man, and must have had intelligence.

unless indeed you suppose, socrates, that these notions are given us at
the very moment of birth; for this is the only time which remains.

yes, my friend, but if so, when do we lose them? for they are not in
us when we are born--that is admitted. do we lose them at the moment of
receiving them, or if not at what other time?

no, socrates, i perceive that i was unconsciously talking nonsense.

then may we not say, simmias, that if, as we are always repeating, there
is an absolute beauty, and goodness, and an absolute essence of all
things; and if to this, which is now discovered to have existed in our
former state, we refer all our sensations, and with this compare them,
finding these ideas to be pre-existent and our inborn possession--then
our souls must have had a prior existence, but if not, there would be
no force in the argument? there is the same proof that these ideas must
have existed before we were born, as that our souls existed before we
were born; and if not the ideas, then not the souls.

yes, socrates; i am convinced that there is precisely the same necessity
for the one as for the other; and the argument retreats successfully
to the position that the existence of the soul before birth cannot be
separated from the existence of the essence of which you speak. for
there is nothing which to my mind is so patent as that beauty, goodness,
and the other notions of which you were just now speaking, have a most
real and absolute existence; and i am satisfied with the proof.

well, but is cebes equally satisfied? for i must convince him too.

i think, said simmias, that cebes is satisfied: although he is the most
incredulous of mortals, yet i believe that he is sufficiently convinced
of the existence of the soul before birth. but that after death the soul
will continue to exist is not yet proven even to my own satisfaction.
i cannot get rid of the feeling of the many to which cebes was
referring--the feeling that when the man dies the soul will be
dispersed, and that this may be the extinction of her. for admitting
that she may have been born elsewhere, and framed out of other elements,
and was in existence before entering the human body, why after having
entered in and gone out again may she not herself be destroyed and come
to an end?

very true, simmias, said cebes; about half of what was required has been
proven; to wit, that our souls existed before we were born:--that the
soul will exist after death as well as before birth is the other half of
which the proof is still wanting, and has to be supplied; when that is
given the demonstration will be complete.

but that proof, simmias and cebes, has been already given, said
socrates, if you put the two arguments together--i mean this and the
former one, in which we admitted that everything living is born of the
dead. for if the soul exists before birth, and in coming to life and
being born can be born only from death and dying, must she not after
death continue to exist, since she has to be born again?--surely the
proof which you desire has been already furnished. still i suspect
that you and simmias would be glad to probe the argument further. like
children, you are haunted with a fear that when the soul leaves the
body, the wind may really blow her away and scatter her; especially if a
man should happen to die in a great storm and not when the sky is calm.

cebes answered with a smile: then, socrates, you must argue us out of
our fears--and yet, strictly speaking, they are not our fears, but there
is a child within us to whom death is a sort of hobgoblin; him too we
must persuade not to be afraid when he is alone in the dark.

socrates said: let the voice of the charmer be applied daily until you
have charmed away the fear.

and where shall we find a good charmer of our fears, socrates, when you
are gone?

hellas, he replied, is a large place, cebes, and has many good men, and
there are barbarous races not a few: seek for him among them all, far
and wide, sparing neither pains nor money; for there is no better way
of spending your money. and you must seek among yourselves too; for you
will not find others better able to make the search.

the search, replied cebes, shall certainly be made. and now, if
you please, let us return to the point of the argument at which we
digressed.

by all means, replied socrates; what else should i please?

very good.

must we not, said socrates, ask ourselves what that is which, as we
imagine, is liable to be scattered, and about which we fear? and what
again is that about which we have no fear? and then we may proceed
further to enquire whether that which suffers dispersion is or is not
of the nature of soul--our hopes and fears as to our own souls will turn
upon the answers to these questions.

very true, he said.

now the compound or composite may be supposed to be naturally capable,
as of being compounded, so also of being dissolved; but that which is
uncompounded, and that only, must be, if anything is, indissoluble.

yes; i should imagine so, said cebes.

and the uncompounded may be assumed to be the same and unchanging,
whereas the compound is always changing and never the same.

i agree, he said.

then now let us return to the previous discussion. is that idea or
essence, which in the dialectical process we define as essence or true
existence--whether essence of equality, beauty, or anything else--are
these essences, i say, liable at times to some degree of change? or
are they each of them always what they are, having the same simple
self-existent and unchanging forms, not admitting of variation at all,
or in any way, or at any time?

they must be always the same, socrates, replied cebes.

and what would you say of the many beautiful--whether men or horses or
garments or any other things which are named by the same names and may
be called equal or beautiful,--are they all unchanging and the same
always, or quite the reverse? may they not rather be described as almost
always changing and hardly ever the same, either with themselves or with
one another?

the latter, replied cebes; they are always in a state of change.

and these you can touch and see and perceive with the senses, but
the unchanging things you can only perceive with the mind--they are
invisible and are not seen?

that is very true, he said.

well, then, added socrates, let us suppose that there are two sorts of
existences--one seen, the other unseen.

let us suppose them.

the seen is the changing, and the unseen is the unchanging?

that may be also supposed.

and, further, is not one part of us body, another part soul?

to be sure.

and to which class is the body more alike and akin?

clearly to the seen--no one can doubt that.

and is the soul seen or not seen?

not by man, socrates.

and what we mean by 'seen' and 'not seen' is that which is or is not
visible to the eye of man?

yes, to the eye of man.

and is the soul seen or not seen?

not seen.

unseen then?

yes.

then the soul is more like to the unseen, and the body to the seen?

that follows necessarily, socrates.

and were we not saying long ago that the soul when using the body as an
instrument of perception, that is to say, when using the sense of sight
or hearing or some other sense (for the meaning of perceiving through
the body is perceiving through the senses)--were we not saying that the
soul too is then dragged by the body into the region of the changeable,
and wanders and is confused; the world spins round her, and she is like
a drunkard, when she touches change?

very true.

but when returning into herself she reflects, then she passes into the
other world, the region of purity, and eternity, and immortality, and
unchangeableness, which are her kindred, and with them she ever lives,
when she is by herself and is not let or hindered; then she ceases
from her erring ways, and being in communion with the unchanging is
unchanging. and this state of the soul is called wisdom?

that is well and truly said, socrates, he replied.

and to which class is the soul more nearly alike and akin, as far as may
be inferred from this argument, as well as from the preceding one?

i think, socrates, that, in the opinion of every one who follows the
argument, the soul will be infinitely more like the unchangeable--even
the most stupid person will not deny that.

and the body is more like the changing?

yes.

yet once more consider the matter in another light: when the soul and
the body are united, then nature orders the soul to rule and govern, and
the body to obey and serve. now which of these two functions is akin to
the divine? and which to the mortal? does not the divine appear to you
to be that which naturally orders and rules, and the mortal to be that
which is subject and servant?

true.

and which does the soul resemble?

the soul resembles the divine, and the body the mortal--there can be no
doubt of that, socrates.

then reflect, cebes: of all which has been said is not this the
conclusion?--that the soul is in the very likeness of the divine,
and immortal, and intellectual, and uniform, and indissoluble, and
unchangeable; and that the body is in the very likeness of the human,
and mortal, and unintellectual, and multiform, and dissoluble, and
changeable. can this, my dear cebes, be denied?

it cannot.

but if it be true, then is not the body liable to speedy dissolution?
and is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?

certainly.

and do you further observe, that after a man is dead, the body, or
visible part of him, which is lying in the visible world, and is
called a corpse, and would naturally be dissolved and decomposed and
dissipated, is not dissolved or decomposed at once, but may remain for a
for some time, nay even for a long time, if the constitution be sound at
the time of death, and the season of the year favourable? for the body
when shrunk and embalmed, as the manner is in egypt, may remain almost
entire through infinite ages; and even in decay, there are still
some portions, such as the bones and ligaments, which are practically
indestructible:--do you agree?

yes.

and is it likely that the soul, which is invisible, in passing to the
place of the true hades, which like her is invisible, and pure, and
noble, and on her way to the good and wise god, whither, if god will, my
soul is also soon to go,--that the soul, i repeat, if this be her nature
and origin, will be blown away and destroyed immediately on quitting the
body, as the many say? that can never be, my dear simmias and cebes.
the truth rather is, that the soul which is pure at departing and draws
after her no bodily taint, having never voluntarily during life had
connection with the body, which she is ever avoiding, herself gathered
into herself;--and making such abstraction her perpetual study--which
means that she has been a true disciple of philosophy; and therefore
has in fact been always engaged in the practice of dying? for is not
philosophy the practice of death?--

certainly--

that soul, i say, herself invisible, departs to the invisible world--to
the divine and immortal and rational: thither arriving, she is secure of
bliss and is released from the error and folly of men, their fears and
wild passions and all other human ills, and for ever dwells, as they say
of the initiated, in company with the gods (compare apol.). is not this
true, cebes?

yes, said cebes, beyond a doubt.

but the soul which has been polluted, and is impure at the time of her
departure, and is the companion and servant of the body always, and is
in love with and fascinated by the body and by the desires and pleasures
of the body, until she is led to believe that the truth only exists in
a bodily form, which a man may touch and see and taste, and use for the
purposes of his lusts,--the soul, i mean, accustomed to hate and fear
and avoid the intellectual principle, which to the bodily eye is dark
and invisible, and can be attained only by philosophy;--do you suppose
that such a soul will depart pure and unalloyed?

impossible, he replied.

she is held fast by the corporeal, which the continual association and
constant care of the body have wrought into her nature.

very true.

and this corporeal element, my friend, is heavy and weighty and earthy,
and is that element of sight by which a soul is depressed and dragged
down again into the visible world, because she is afraid of the
invisible and of the world below--prowling about tombs and sepulchres,
near which, as they tell us, are seen certain ghostly apparitions
of souls which have not departed pure, but are cloyed with sight and
therefore visible.

(compare milton, comus:--

     'but when lust,
     by unchaste looks, loose gestures, and foul talk,
     but most by lewd and lavish act of sin,
     lets in defilement to the inward parts,
     the soul grows clotted by contagion,
     imbodies, and imbrutes, till she quite lose,
     the divine property of her first being.
     such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp
     oft seen in charnel vaults and sepulchres,
     lingering, and sitting by a new made grave,
     as loath to leave the body that it lov'd,
     and linked itself by carnal sensuality
     to a degenerate and degraded state.')

that is very likely, socrates.

yes, that is very likely, cebes; and these must be the souls, not of the
good, but of the evil, which are compelled to wander about such places
in payment of the penalty of their former evil way of life; and they
continue to wander until through the craving after the corporeal which
never leaves them, they are imprisoned finally in another body. and they
may be supposed to find their prisons in the same natures which they
have had in their former lives.

what natures do you mean, socrates?

what i mean is that men who have followed after gluttony, and
wantonness, and drunkenness, and have had no thought of avoiding them,
would pass into asses and animals of that sort. what do you think?

i think such an opinion to be exceedingly probable.

and those who have chosen the portion of injustice, and tyranny, and
violence, will pass into wolves, or into hawks and kites;--whither else
can we suppose them to go?

yes, said cebes; with such natures, beyond question.

and there is no difficulty, he said, in assigning to all of them places
answering to their several natures and propensities?

there is not, he said.

some are happier than others; and the happiest both in themselves and
in the place to which they go are those who have practised the civil and
social virtues which are called temperance and justice, and are acquired
by habit and attention without philosophy and mind. (compare republic.)

why are they the happiest?

because they may be expected to pass into some gentle and social kind
which is like their own, such as bees or wasps or ants, or back again
into the form of man, and just and moderate men may be supposed to
spring from them.

very likely.

no one who has not studied philosophy and who is not entirely pure at
the time of his departure is allowed to enter the company of the gods,
but the lover of knowledge only. and this is the reason, simmias and
cebes, why the true votaries of philosophy abstain from all fleshly
lusts, and hold out against them and refuse to give themselves up to
them,--not because they fear poverty or the ruin of their families, like
the lovers of money, and the world in general; nor like the lovers of
power and honour, because they dread the dishonour or disgrace of evil
deeds.

no, socrates, that would not become them, said cebes.

no indeed, he replied; and therefore they who have any care of their
own souls, and do not merely live moulding and fashioning the body, say
farewell to all this; they will not walk in the ways of the blind: and
when philosophy offers them purification and release from evil, they
feel that they ought not to resist her influence, and whither she leads
they turn and follow.

what do you mean, socrates?

i will tell you, he said. the lovers of knowledge are conscious that
the soul was simply fastened and glued to the body--until philosophy
received her, she could only view real existence through the bars of
a prison, not in and through herself; she was wallowing in the mire of
every sort of ignorance; and by reason of lust had become the principal
accomplice in her own captivity. this was her original state; and
then, as i was saying, and as the lovers of knowledge are well aware,
philosophy, seeing how terrible was her confinement, of which she was
to herself the cause, received and gently comforted her and sought to
release her, pointing out that the eye and the ear and the other senses
are full of deception, and persuading her to retire from them, and
abstain from all but the necessary use of them, and be gathered up and
collected into herself, bidding her trust in herself and her own pure
apprehension of pure existence, and to mistrust whatever comes to her
through other channels and is subject to variation; for such things
are visible and tangible, but what she sees in her own nature is
intelligible and invisible. and the soul of the true philosopher thinks
that she ought not to resist this deliverance, and therefore abstains
from pleasures and desires and pains and fears, as far as she is
able; reflecting that when a man has great joys or sorrows or fears or
desires, he suffers from them, not merely the sort of evil which might
be anticipated--as for example, the loss of his health or property which
he has sacrificed to his lusts--but an evil greater far, which is the
greatest and worst of all evils, and one of which he never thinks.

what is it, socrates? said cebes.

the evil is that when the feeling of pleasure or pain is most intense,
every soul of man imagines the objects of this intense feeling to be
then plainest and truest: but this is not so, they are really the things
of sight.

very true.

and is not this the state in which the soul is most enthralled by the
body?

how so?

why, because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails
and rivets the soul to the body, until she becomes like the body, and
believes that to be true which the body affirms to be true; and from
agreeing with the body and having the same delights she is obliged to
have the same habits and haunts, and is not likely ever to be pure at
her departure to the world below, but is always infected by the body;
and so she sinks into another body and there germinates and grows,
and has therefore no part in the communion of the divine and pure and
simple.

most true, socrates, answered cebes.

and this, cebes, is the reason why the true lovers of knowledge are
temperate and brave; and not for the reason which the world gives.

certainly not.

certainly not! the soul of a philosopher will reason in quite another
way; she will not ask philosophy to release her in order that when
released she may deliver herself up again to the thraldom of pleasures
and pains, doing a work only to be undone again, weaving instead of
unweaving her penelope's web. but she will calm passion, and follow
reason, and dwell in the contemplation of her, beholding the true
and divine (which is not matter of opinion), and thence deriving
nourishment. thus she seeks to live while she lives, and after death she
hopes to go to her own kindred and to that which is like her, and to be
freed from human ills. never fear, simmias and cebes, that a soul which
has been thus nurtured and has had these pursuits, will at her departure
from the body be scattered and blown away by the winds and be nowhere
and nothing.

when socrates had done speaking, for a considerable time there was
silence; he himself appeared to be meditating, as most of us were, on
what had been said; only cebes and simmias spoke a few words to one
another. and socrates observing them asked what they thought of the
argument, and whether there was anything wanting? for, said he, there
are many points still open to suspicion and attack, if any one were
disposed to sift the matter thoroughly. should you be considering
some other matter i say no more, but if you are still in doubt do not
hesitate to say exactly what you think, and let us have anything better
which you can suggest; and if you think that i can be of any use, allow
me to help you.

simmias said: i must confess, socrates, that doubts did arise in our
minds, and each of us was urging and inciting the other to put the
question which we wanted to have answered and which neither of us liked
to ask, fearing that our importunity might be troublesome under present
at such a time.

socrates replied with a smile: o simmias, what are you saying? i am
not very likely to persuade other men that i do not regard my present
situation as a misfortune, if i cannot even persuade you that i am no
worse off now than at any other time in my life. will you not allow that
i have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans? for they,
when they perceive that they must die, having sung all their life long,
do then sing more lustily than ever, rejoicing in the thought that
they are about to go away to the god whose ministers they are. but men,
because they are themselves afraid of death, slanderously affirm of the
swans that they sing a lament at the last, not considering that no bird
sings when cold, or hungry, or in pain, not even the nightingale, nor
the swallow, nor yet the hoopoe; which are said indeed to tune a lay of
sorrow, although i do not believe this to be true of them any more than
of the swans. but because they are sacred to apollo, they have the gift
of prophecy, and anticipate the good things of another world, wherefore
they sing and rejoice in that day more than they ever did before. and i
too, believing myself to be the consecrated servant of the same god, and
the fellow-servant of the swans, and thinking that i have received from
my master gifts of prophecy which are not inferior to theirs, would not
go out of life less merrily than the swans. never mind then, if this be
your only objection, but speak and ask anything which you like, while
the eleven magistrates of athens allow.

very good, socrates, said simmias; then i will tell you my difficulty,
and cebes will tell you his. i feel myself, (and i daresay that you have
the same feeling), how hard or rather impossible is the attainment of
any certainty about questions such as these in the present life. and yet
i should deem him a coward who did not prove what is said about them to
the uttermost, or whose heart failed him before he had examined them
on every side. for he should persevere until he has achieved one of two
things: either he should discover, or be taught the truth about them;
or, if this be impossible, i would have him take the best and most
irrefragable of human theories, and let this be the raft upon which he
sails through life--not without risk, as i admit, if he cannot find some
word of god which will more surely and safely carry him. and now, as
you bid me, i will venture to question you, and then i shall not have to
reproach myself hereafter with not having said at the time what i think.
for when i consider the matter, either alone or with cebes, the argument
does certainly appear to me, socrates, to be not sufficient.

socrates answered: i dare say, my friend, that you may be right, but i
should like to know in what respect the argument is insufficient.

in this respect, replied simmias:--suppose a person to use the same
argument about harmony and the lyre--might he not say that harmony is
a thing invisible, incorporeal, perfect, divine, existing in the lyre
which is harmonized, but that the lyre and the strings are matter and
material, composite, earthy, and akin to mortality? and when some one
breaks the lyre, or cuts and rends the strings, then he who takes this
view would argue as you do, and on the same analogy, that the harmony
survives and has not perished--you cannot imagine, he would say, that
the lyre without the strings, and the broken strings themselves which
are mortal remain, and yet that the harmony, which is of heavenly and
immortal nature and kindred, has perished--perished before the mortal.
the harmony must still be somewhere, and the wood and strings will decay
before anything can happen to that. the thought, socrates, must have
occurred to your own mind that such is our conception of the soul;
and that when the body is in a manner strung and held together by the
elements of hot and cold, wet and dry, then the soul is the harmony or
due proportionate admixture of them. but if so, whenever the strings of
the body are unduly loosened or overstrained through disease or other
injury, then the soul, though most divine, like other harmonies of music
or of works of art, of course perishes at once, although the material
remains of the body may last for a considerable time, until they are
either decayed or burnt. and if any one maintains that the soul, being
the harmony of the elements of the body, is first to perish in that
which is called death, how shall we answer him?

socrates looked fixedly at us as his manner was, and said with a smile:
simmias has reason on his side; and why does not some one of you who
is better able than myself answer him? for there is force in his attack
upon me. but perhaps, before we answer him, we had better also hear what
cebes has to say that we may gain time for reflection, and when they
have both spoken, we may either assent to them, if there is truth in
what they say, or if not, we will maintain our position. please to tell
me then, cebes, he said, what was the difficulty which troubled you?

cebes said: i will tell you. my feeling is that the argument is where it
was, and open to the same objections which were urged before; for i am
ready to admit that the existence of the soul before entering into
the bodily form has been very ingeniously, and, if i may say so, quite
sufficiently proven; but the existence of the soul after death is still,
in my judgment, unproven. now my objection is not the same as that of
simmias; for i am not disposed to deny that the soul is stronger and
more lasting than the body, being of opinion that in all such respects
the soul very far excels the body. well, then, says the argument to me,
why do you remain unconvinced?--when you see that the weaker continues
in existence after the man is dead, will you not admit that the more
lasting must also survive during the same period of time? now i will
ask you to consider whether the objection, which, like simmias, i will
express in a figure, is of any weight. the analogy which i will adduce
is that of an old weaver, who dies, and after his death somebody
says:--he is not dead, he must be alive;--see, there is the coat which
he himself wove and wore, and which remains whole and undecayed. and
then he proceeds to ask of some one who is incredulous, whether a man
lasts longer, or the coat which is in use and wear; and when he is
answered that a man lasts far longer, thinks that he has thus certainly
demonstrated the survival of the man, who is the more lasting, because
the less lasting remains. but that, simmias, as i would beg you to
remark, is a mistake; any one can see that he who talks thus is talking
nonsense. for the truth is, that the weaver aforesaid, having woven and
worn many such coats, outlived several of them, and was outlived by the
last; but a man is not therefore proved to be slighter and weaker than
a coat. now the relation of the body to the soul may be expressed in a
similar figure; and any one may very fairly say in like manner that the
soul is lasting, and the body weak and shortlived in comparison. he may
argue in like manner that every soul wears out many bodies, especially
if a man live many years. while he is alive the body deliquesces and
decays, and the soul always weaves another garment and repairs the
waste. but of course, whenever the soul perishes, she must have on her
last garment, and this will survive her; and then at length, when
the soul is dead, the body will show its native weakness, and quickly
decompose and pass away. i would therefore rather not rely on the
argument from superior strength to prove the continued existence of the
soul after death. for granting even more than you affirm to be possible,
and acknowledging not only that the soul existed before birth, but also
that the souls of some exist, and will continue to exist after death,
and will be born and die again and again, and that there is a
natural strength in the soul which will hold out and be born many
times--nevertheless, we may be still inclined to think that she will
weary in the labours of successive births, and may at last succumb in
one of her deaths and utterly perish; and this death and dissolution of
the body which brings destruction to the soul may be unknown to any of
us, for no one of us can have had any experience of it: and if so,
then i maintain that he who is confident about death has but a foolish
confidence, unless he is able to prove that the soul is altogether
immortal and imperishable. but if he cannot prove the soul's
immortality, he who is about to die will always have reason to fear that
when the body is disunited, the soul also may utterly perish.

all of us, as we afterwards remarked to one another, had an unpleasant
feeling at hearing what they said. when we had been so firmly convinced
before, now to have our faith shaken seemed to introduce a confusion and
uncertainty, not only into the previous argument, but into any future
one; either we were incapable of forming a judgment, or there were no
grounds of belief.

echecrates: there i feel with you--by heaven i do, phaedo, and when you
were speaking, i was beginning to ask myself the same question: what
argument can i ever trust again? for what could be more convincing than
the argument of socrates, which has now fallen into discredit? that
the soul is a harmony is a doctrine which has always had a wonderful
attraction for me, and, when mentioned, came back to me at once, as my
own original conviction. and now i must begin again and find another
argument which will assure me that when the man is dead the soul
survives. tell me, i implore you, how did socrates proceed? did he
appear to share the unpleasant feeling which you mention? or did he
calmly meet the attack? and did he answer forcibly or feebly? narrate
what passed as exactly as you can.

phaedo: often, echecrates, i have wondered at socrates, but never more
than on that occasion. that he should be able to answer was nothing,
but what astonished me was, first, the gentle and pleasant and approving
manner in which he received the words of the young men, and then his
quick sense of the wound which had been inflicted by the argument, and
the readiness with which he healed it. he might be compared to a general
rallying his defeated and broken army, urging them to accompany him and
return to the field of argument.

echecrates: what followed?

phaedo: you shall hear, for i was close to him on his right hand, seated
on a sort of stool, and he on a couch which was a good deal higher.
he stroked my head, and pressed the hair upon my neck--he had a way of
playing with my hair; and then he said: to-morrow, phaedo, i suppose
that these fair locks of yours will be severed.

yes, socrates, i suppose that they will, i replied.

not so, if you will take my advice.

what shall i do with them? i said.

to-day, he replied, and not to-morrow, if this argument dies and we
cannot bring it to life again, you and i will both shave our locks; and
if i were you, and the argument got away from me, and i could not hold
my ground against simmias and cebes, i would myself take an oath, like
the argives, not to wear hair any more until i had renewed the conflict
and defeated them.

yes, i said, but heracles himself is said not to be a match for two.

summon me then, he said, and i will be your iolaus until the sun goes
down.

i summon you rather, i rejoined, not as heracles summoning iolaus, but
as iolaus might summon heracles.

that will do as well, he said. but first let us take care that we avoid
a danger.

of what nature? i said.

lest we become misologists, he replied, no worse thing can happen to a
man than this. for as there are misanthropists or haters of men, there
are also misologists or haters of ideas, and both spring from the same
cause, which is ignorance of the world. misanthropy arises out of the
too great confidence of inexperience;--you trust a man and think him
altogether true and sound and faithful, and then in a little while he
turns out to be false and knavish; and then another and another, and
when this has happened several times to a man, especially when it
happens among those whom he deems to be his own most trusted and
familiar friends, and he has often quarreled with them, he at last hates
all men, and believes that no one has any good in him at all. you must
have observed this trait of character?

i have.

and is not the feeling discreditable? is it not obvious that such an
one having to deal with other men, was clearly without any experience of
human nature; for experience would have taught him the true state of
the case, that few are the good and few the evil, and that the great
majority are in the interval between them.

what do you mean? i said.

i mean, he replied, as you might say of the very large and very small,
that nothing is more uncommon than a very large or very small man; and
this applies generally to all extremes, whether of great and small, or
swift and slow, or fair and foul, or black and white: and whether
the instances you select be men or dogs or anything else, few are the
extremes, but many are in the mean between them. did you never observe
this?

yes, i said, i have.

and do you not imagine, he said, that if there were a competition in
evil, the worst would be found to be very few?

yes, that is very likely, i said.

yes, that is very likely, he replied; although in this respect arguments
are unlike men--there i was led on by you to say more than i had
intended; but the point of comparison was, that when a simple man who
has no skill in dialectics believes an argument to be true which he
afterwards imagines to be false, whether really false or not, and
then another and another, he has no longer any faith left, and great
disputers, as you know, come to think at last that they have grown to be
the wisest of mankind; for they alone perceive the utter unsoundness and
instability of all arguments, or indeed, of all things, which, like the
currents in the euripus, are going up and down in never-ceasing ebb and
flow.

that is quite true, i said.

yes, phaedo, he replied, and how melancholy, if there be such a thing as
truth or certainty or possibility of knowledge--that a man should have
lighted upon some argument or other which at first seemed true and then
turned out to be false, and instead of blaming himself and his own want
of wit, because he is annoyed, should at last be too glad to transfer
the blame from himself to arguments in general: and for ever afterwards
should hate and revile them, and lose truth and the knowledge of
realities.

yes, indeed, i said; that is very melancholy.

let us then, in the first place, he said, be careful of allowing or of
admitting into our souls the notion that there is no health or soundness
in any arguments at all. rather say that we have not yet attained to
soundness in ourselves, and that we must struggle manfully and do our
best to gain health of mind--you and all other men having regard to the
whole of your future life, and i myself in the prospect of death. for at
this moment i am sensible that i have not the temper of a philosopher;
like the vulgar, i am only a partisan. now the partisan, when he is
engaged in a dispute, cares nothing about the rights of the question,
but is anxious only to convince his hearers of his own assertions.
and the difference between him and me at the present moment is merely
this--that whereas he seeks to convince his hearers that what he says is
true, i am rather seeking to convince myself; to convince my hearers
is a secondary matter with me. and do but see how much i gain by the
argument. for if what i say is true, then i do well to be persuaded of
the truth, but if there be nothing after death, still, during the short
time that remains, i shall not distress my friends with lamentations,
and my ignorance will not last, but will die with me, and therefore
no harm will be done. this is the state of mind, simmias and cebes, in
which i approach the argument. and i would ask you to be thinking of
the truth and not of socrates: agree with me, if i seem to you to be
speaking the truth; or if not, withstand me might and main, that i may
not deceive you as well as myself in my enthusiasm, and like the bee,
leave my sting in you before i die.

and now let us proceed, he said. and first of all let me be sure that
i have in my mind what you were saying. simmias, if i remember rightly,
has fears and misgivings whether the soul, although a fairer and diviner
thing than the body, being as she is in the form of harmony, may not
perish first. on the other hand, cebes appeared to grant that the soul
was more lasting than the body, but he said that no one could know
whether the soul, after having worn out many bodies, might not perish
herself and leave her last body behind her; and that this is death,
which is the destruction not of the body but of the soul, for in the
body the work of destruction is ever going on. are not these, simmias
and cebes, the points which we have to consider?

they both agreed to this statement of them.

he proceeded: and did you deny the force of the whole preceding
argument, or of a part only?

of a part only, they replied.

and what did you think, he said, of that part of the argument in which
we said that knowledge was recollection, and hence inferred that the
soul must have previously existed somewhere else before she was enclosed
in the body?

cebes said that he had been wonderfully impressed by that part of the
argument, and that his conviction remained absolutely unshaken. simmias
agreed, and added that he himself could hardly imagine the possibility
of his ever thinking differently.

but, rejoined socrates, you will have to think differently, my theban
friend, if you still maintain that harmony is a compound, and that the
soul is a harmony which is made out of strings set in the frame of the
body; for you will surely never allow yourself to say that a harmony is
prior to the elements which compose it.

never, socrates.

but do you not see that this is what you imply when you say that the
soul existed before she took the form and body of man, and was made up
of elements which as yet had no existence? for harmony is not like
the soul, as you suppose; but first the lyre, and the strings, and the
sounds exist in a state of discord, and then harmony is made last of
all, and perishes first. and how can such a notion of the soul as this
agree with the other?

not at all, replied simmias.

and yet, he said, there surely ought to be harmony in a discourse of
which harmony is the theme.

there ought, replied simmias.

but there is no harmony, he said, in the two propositions that knowledge
is recollection, and that the soul is a harmony. which of them will you
retain?

i think, he replied, that i have a much stronger faith, socrates, in the
first of the two, which has been fully demonstrated to me, than in
the latter, which has not been demonstrated at all, but rests only on
probable and plausible grounds; and is therefore believed by the many. i
know too well that these arguments from probabilities are impostors, and
unless great caution is observed in the use of them, they are apt to
be deceptive--in geometry, and in other things too. but the doctrine of
knowledge and recollection has been proven to me on trustworthy grounds;
and the proof was that the soul must have existed before she came into
the body, because to her belongs the essence of which the very name
implies existence. having, as i am convinced, rightly accepted this
conclusion, and on sufficient grounds, i must, as i suppose, cease to
argue or allow others to argue that the soul is a harmony.

let me put the matter, simmias, he said, in another point of view: do
you imagine that a harmony or any other composition can be in a state
other than that of the elements, out of which it is compounded?

certainly not.

or do or suffer anything other than they do or suffer?

he agreed.

then a harmony does not, properly speaking, lead the parts or elements
which make up the harmony, but only follows them.

he assented.

for harmony cannot possibly have any motion, or sound, or other quality
which is opposed to its parts.

that would be impossible, he replied.

and does not the nature of every harmony depend upon the manner in which
the elements are harmonized?

i do not understand you, he said.

i mean to say that a harmony admits of degrees, and is more of a
harmony, and more completely a harmony, when more truly and fully
harmonized, to any extent which is possible; and less of a harmony, and
less completely a harmony, when less truly and fully harmonized.

true.

but does the soul admit of degrees? or is one soul in the very least
degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than another?

not in the least.

yet surely of two souls, one is said to have intelligence and virtue,
and to be good, and the other to have folly and vice, and to be an evil
soul: and this is said truly?

yes, truly.

but what will those who maintain the soul to be a harmony say of this
presence of virtue and vice in the soul?--will they say that here is
another harmony, and another discord, and that the virtuous soul is
harmonized, and herself being a harmony has another harmony within her,
and that the vicious soul is inharmonical and has no harmony within her?

i cannot tell, replied simmias; but i suppose that something of the sort
would be asserted by those who say that the soul is a harmony.

and we have already admitted that no soul is more a soul than another;
which is equivalent to admitting that harmony is not more or less
harmony, or more or less completely a harmony?

quite true.

and that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less
harmonized?

true.

and that which is not more or less harmonized cannot have more or less
of harmony, but only an equal harmony?

yes, an equal harmony.

then one soul not being more or less absolutely a soul than another, is
not more or less harmonized?

exactly.

and therefore has neither more nor less of discord, nor yet of harmony?

she has not.

and having neither more nor less of harmony or of discord, one soul
has no more vice or virtue than another, if vice be discord and virtue
harmony?

not at all more.

or speaking more correctly, simmias, the soul, if she is a harmony, will
never have any vice; because a harmony, being absolutely a harmony, has
no part in the inharmonical.

no.

and therefore a soul which is absolutely a soul has no vice?

how can she have, if the previous argument holds?

then, if all souls are equally by their nature souls, all souls of all
living creatures will be equally good?

i agree with you, socrates, he said.

and can all this be true, think you? he said; for these are the
consequences which seem to follow from the assumption that the soul is a
harmony?

it cannot be true.

once more, he said, what ruler is there of the elements of human nature
other than the soul, and especially the wise soul? do you know of any?

indeed, i do not.

and is the soul in agreement with the affections of the body? or is she
at variance with them? for example, when the body is hot and thirsty,
does not the soul incline us against drinking? and when the body
is hungry, against eating? and this is only one instance out of ten
thousand of the opposition of the soul to the things of the body.

very true.

but we have already acknowledged that the soul, being a harmony, can
never utter a note at variance with the tensions and relaxations and
vibrations and other affections of the strings out of which she is
composed; she can only follow, she cannot lead them?

it must be so, he replied.

and yet do we not now discover the soul to be doing the exact
opposite--leading the elements of which she is believed to be composed;
almost always opposing and coercing them in all sorts of ways throughout
life, sometimes more violently with the pains of medicine and gymnastic;
then again more gently; now threatening, now admonishing the desires,
passions, fears, as if talking to a thing which is not herself, as homer
in the odyssee represents odysseus doing in the words--

'he beat his breast, and thus reproached his heart: endure, my heart;
far worse hast thou endured!'

do you think that homer wrote this under the idea that the soul is a
harmony capable of being led by the affections of the body, and not
rather of a nature which should lead and master them--herself a far
diviner thing than any harmony?

yes, socrates, i quite think so.

then, my friend, we can never be right in saying that the soul is a
harmony, for we should contradict the divine homer, and contradict
ourselves.

true, he said.

thus much, said socrates, of harmonia, your theban goddess, who has
graciously yielded to us; but what shall i say, cebes, to her husband
cadmus, and how shall i make peace with him?

i think that you will discover a way of propitiating him, said cebes; i
am sure that you have put the argument with harmonia in a manner that
i could never have expected. for when simmias was mentioning his
difficulty, i quite imagined that no answer could be given to him, and
therefore i was surprised at finding that his argument could not sustain
the first onset of yours, and not impossibly the other, whom you call
cadmus, may share a similar fate.

nay, my good friend, said socrates, let us not boast, lest some evil eye
should put to flight the word which i am about to speak. that, however,
may be left in the hands of those above, while i draw near in homeric
fashion, and try the mettle of your words. here lies the point:--you
want to have it proven to you that the soul is imperishable and
immortal, and the philosopher who is confident in death appears to you
to have but a vain and foolish confidence, if he believes that he will
fare better in the world below than one who has led another sort of
life, unless he can prove this; and you say that the demonstration of
the strength and divinity of the soul, and of her existence prior to our
becoming men, does not necessarily imply her immortality. admitting the
soul to be longlived, and to have known and done much in a former state,
still she is not on that account immortal; and her entrance into
the human form may be a sort of disease which is the beginning of
dissolution, and may at last, after the toils of life are over, end in
that which is called death. and whether the soul enters into the body
once only or many times, does not, as you say, make any difference in
the fears of individuals. for any man, who is not devoid of sense,
must fear, if he has no knowledge and can give no account of the soul's
immortality. this, or something like this, i suspect to be your notion,
cebes; and i designedly recur to it in order that nothing may escape us,
and that you may, if you wish, add or subtract anything.

but, said cebes, as far as i see at present, i have nothing to add or
subtract: i mean what you say that i mean.

socrates paused awhile, and seemed to be absorbed in reflection. at
length he said: you are raising a tremendous question, cebes, involving
the whole nature of generation and corruption, about which, if you like,
i will give you my own experience; and if anything which i say is likely
to avail towards the solution of your difficulty you may make use of it.

i should very much like, said cebes, to hear what you have to say.

then i will tell you, said socrates. when i was young, cebes, i had a
prodigious desire to know that department of philosophy which is called
the investigation of nature; to know the causes of things, and why
a thing is and is created or destroyed appeared to me to be a lofty
profession; and i was always agitating myself with the consideration of
questions such as these:--is the growth of animals the result of some
decay which the hot and cold principle contracts, as some have said? is
the blood the element with which we think, or the air, or the fire? or
perhaps nothing of the kind--but the brain may be the originating
power of the perceptions of hearing and sight and smell, and memory
and opinion may come from them, and science may be based on memory and
opinion when they have attained fixity. and then i went on to examine
the corruption of them, and then to the things of heaven and earth, and
at last i concluded myself to be utterly and absolutely incapable
of these enquiries, as i will satisfactorily prove to you. for i was
fascinated by them to such a degree that my eyes grew blind to things
which i had seemed to myself, and also to others, to know quite well; i
forgot what i had before thought self-evident truths; e.g. such a fact
as that the growth of man is the result of eating and drinking; for when
by the digestion of food flesh is added to flesh and bone to bone, and
whenever there is an aggregation of congenial elements, the lesser
bulk becomes larger and the small man great. was not that a reasonable
notion?

yes, said cebes, i think so.

well; but let me tell you something more. there was a time when i
thought that i understood the meaning of greater and less pretty well;
and when i saw a great man standing by a little one, i fancied that one
was taller than the other by a head; or one horse would appear to
be greater than another horse: and still more clearly did i seem to
perceive that ten is two more than eight, and that two cubits are more
than one, because two is the double of one.

and what is now your notion of such matters? said cebes.

i should be far enough from imagining, he replied, that i knew the cause
of any of them, by heaven i should; for i cannot satisfy myself that,
when one is added to one, the one to which the addition is made becomes
two, or that the two units added together make two by reason of the
addition. i cannot understand how, when separated from the other, each
of them was one and not two, and now, when they are brought together,
the mere juxtaposition or meeting of them should be the cause of their
becoming two: neither can i understand how the division of one is the
way to make two; for then a different cause would produce the same
effect,--as in the former instance the addition and juxtaposition of one
to one was the cause of two, in this the separation and subtraction of
one from the other would be the cause. nor am i any longer satisfied
that i understand the reason why one or anything else is either
generated or destroyed or is at all, but i have in my mind some confused
notion of a new method, and can never admit the other.

then i heard some one reading, as he said, from a book of anaxagoras,
that mind was the disposer and cause of all, and i was delighted at this
notion, which appeared quite admirable, and i said to myself: if mind
is the disposer, mind will dispose all for the best, and put each
particular in the best place; and i argued that if any one desired to
find out the cause of the generation or destruction or existence of
anything, he must find out what state of being or doing or suffering was
best for that thing, and therefore a man had only to consider the best
for himself and others, and then he would also know the worse, since the
same science comprehended both. and i rejoiced to think that i had found
in anaxagoras a teacher of the causes of existence such as i desired,
and i imagined that he would tell me first whether the earth is flat or
round; and whichever was true, he would proceed to explain the cause and
the necessity of this being so, and then he would teach me the nature of
the best and show that this was best; and if he said that the earth was
in the centre, he would further explain that this position was the best,
and i should be satisfied with the explanation given, and not want any
other sort of cause. and i thought that i would then go on and ask him
about the sun and moon and stars, and that he would explain to me their
comparative swiftness, and their returnings and various states, active
and passive, and how all of them were for the best. for i could not
imagine that when he spoke of mind as the disposer of them, he would
give any other account of their being as they are, except that this was
best; and i thought that when he had explained to me in detail the cause
of each and the cause of all, he would go on to explain to me what was
best for each and what was good for all. these hopes i would not have
sold for a large sum of money, and i seized the books and read them as
fast as i could in my eagerness to know the better and the worse.

what expectations i had formed, and how grievously was i disappointed!
as i proceeded, i found my philosopher altogether forsaking mind or any
other principle of order, but having recourse to air, and ether, and
water, and other eccentricities. i might compare him to a person who
began by maintaining generally that mind is the cause of the actions
of socrates, but who, when he endeavoured to explain the causes of my
several actions in detail, went on to show that i sit here because my
body is made up of bones and muscles; and the bones, as he would say,
are hard and have joints which divide them, and the muscles are elastic,
and they cover the bones, which have also a covering or environment of
flesh and skin which contains them; and as the bones are lifted at their
joints by the contraction or relaxation of the muscles, i am able
to bend my limbs, and this is why i am sitting here in a curved
posture--that is what he would say, and he would have a similar
explanation of my talking to you, which he would attribute to sound, and
air, and hearing, and he would assign ten thousand other causes of the
same sort, forgetting to mention the true cause, which is, that the
athenians have thought fit to condemn me, and accordingly i have thought
it better and more right to remain here and undergo my sentence; for
i am inclined to think that these muscles and bones of mine would have
gone off long ago to megara or boeotia--by the dog they would, if they
had been moved only by their own idea of what was best, and if i had not
chosen the better and nobler part, instead of playing truant and running
away, of enduring any punishment which the state inflicts. there is
surely a strange confusion of causes and conditions in all this. it may
be said, indeed, that without bones and muscles and the other parts
of the body i cannot execute my purposes. but to say that i do as i do
because of them, and that this is the way in which mind acts, and
not from the choice of the best, is a very careless and idle mode of
speaking. i wonder that they cannot distinguish the cause from the
condition, which the many, feeling about in the dark, are always
mistaking and misnaming. and thus one man makes a vortex all round and
steadies the earth by the heaven; another gives the air as a support to
the earth, which is a sort of broad trough. any power which in arranging
them as they are arranges them for the best never enters into their
minds; and instead of finding any superior strength in it, they rather
expect to discover another atlas of the world who is stronger and more
everlasting and more containing than the good;--of the obligatory and
containing power of the good they think nothing; and yet this is the
principle which i would fain learn if any one would teach me. but as i
have failed either to discover myself, or to learn of any one else,
the nature of the best, i will exhibit to you, if you like, what i have
found to be the second best mode of enquiring into the cause.

i should very much like to hear, he replied.

socrates proceeded:--i thought that as i had failed in the contemplation
of true existence, i ought to be careful that i did not lose the eye of
my soul; as people may injure their bodily eye by observing and gazing
on the sun during an eclipse, unless they take the precaution of only
looking at the image reflected in the water, or in some similar medium.
so in my own case, i was afraid that my soul might be blinded altogether
if i looked at things with my eyes or tried to apprehend them by the
help of the senses. and i thought that i had better have recourse to the
world of mind and seek there the truth of existence. i dare say that
the simile is not perfect--for i am very far from admitting that he who
contemplates existences through the medium of thought, sees them only
'through a glass darkly,' any more than he who considers them in action
and operation. however, this was the method which i adopted: i first
assumed some principle which i judged to be the strongest, and then i
affirmed as true whatever seemed to agree with this, whether relating
to the cause or to anything else; and that which disagreed i regarded
as untrue. but i should like to explain my meaning more clearly, as i do
not think that you as yet understand me.

no indeed, replied cebes, not very well.

there is nothing new, he said, in what i am about to tell you; but
only what i have been always and everywhere repeating in the previous
discussion and on other occasions: i want to show you the nature of that
cause which has occupied my thoughts. i shall have to go back to those
familiar words which are in the mouth of every one, and first of all
assume that there is an absolute beauty and goodness and greatness, and
the like; grant me this, and i hope to be able to show you the nature of
the cause, and to prove the immortality of the soul.

cebes said: you may proceed at once with the proof, for i grant you
this.

well, he said, then i should like to know whether you agree with me
in the next step; for i cannot help thinking, if there be anything
beautiful other than absolute beauty should there be such, that it can
be beautiful only in as far as it partakes of absolute beauty--and i
should say the same of everything. do you agree in this notion of the
cause?

yes, he said, i agree.

he proceeded: i know nothing and can understand nothing of any other of
those wise causes which are alleged; and if a person says to me that
the bloom of colour, or form, or any such thing is a source of beauty,
i leave all that, which is only confusing to me, and simply and singly,
and perhaps foolishly, hold and am assured in my own mind that nothing
makes a thing beautiful but the presence and participation of beauty in
whatever way or manner obtained; for as to the manner i am uncertain,
but i stoutly contend that by beauty all beautiful things become
beautiful. this appears to me to be the safest answer which i can give,
either to myself or to another, and to this i cling, in the persuasion
that this principle will never be overthrown, and that to myself or
to any one who asks the question, i may safely reply, that by beauty
beautiful things become beautiful. do you not agree with me?

i do.

and that by greatness only great things become great and greater
greater, and by smallness the less become less?

true.

then if a person were to remark that a is taller by a head than b, and
b less by a head than a, you would refuse to admit his statement, and
would stoutly contend that what you mean is only that the greater is
greater by, and by reason of, greatness, and the less is less only by,
and by reason of, smallness; and thus you would avoid the danger of
saying that the greater is greater and the less less by the measure of
the head, which is the same in both, and would also avoid the monstrous
absurdity of supposing that the greater man is greater by reason of the
head, which is small. you would be afraid to draw such an inference,
would you not?

indeed, i should, said cebes, laughing.

in like manner you would be afraid to say that ten exceeded eight by,
and by reason of, two; but would say by, and by reason of, number; or
you would say that two cubits exceed one cubit not by a half, but by
magnitude?-for there is the same liability to error in all these cases.

very true, he said.

again, would you not be cautious of affirming that the addition of
one to one, or the division of one, is the cause of two? and you would
loudly asseverate that you know of no way in which anything comes
into existence except by participation in its own proper essence,
and consequently, as far as you know, the only cause of two is
the participation in duality--this is the way to make two, and the
participation in one is the way to make one. you would say: i will let
alone puzzles of division and addition--wiser heads than mine may answer
them; inexperienced as i am, and ready to start, as the proverb says,
at my own shadow, i cannot afford to give up the sure ground of a
principle. and if any one assails you there, you would not mind him,
or answer him, until you had seen whether the consequences which follow
agree with one another or not, and when you are further required to give
an explanation of this principle, you would go on to assume a higher
principle, and a higher, until you found a resting-place in the best of
the higher; but you would not confuse the principle and the consequences
in your reasoning, like the eristics--at least if you wanted to discover
real existence. not that this confusion signifies to them, who never
care or think about the matter at all, for they have the wit to be well
pleased with themselves however great may be the turmoil of their ideas.
but you, if you are a philosopher, will certainly do as i say.

what you say is most true, said simmias and cebes, both speaking at
once.

echecrates: yes, phaedo; and i do not wonder at their assenting. any
one who has the least sense will acknowledge the wonderful clearness of
socrates' reasoning.

phaedo: certainly, echecrates; and such was the feeling of the whole
company at the time.

echecrates: yes, and equally of ourselves, who were not of the company,
and are now listening to your recital. but what followed?

phaedo: after all this had been admitted, and they had that ideas exist,
and that other things participate in them and derive their names from
them, socrates, if i remember rightly, said:--

this is your way of speaking; and yet when you say that simmias is
greater than socrates and less than phaedo, do you not predicate of
simmias both greatness and smallness?

yes, i do.

but still you allow that simmias does not really exceed socrates, as
the words may seem to imply, because he is simmias, but by reason of the
size which he has; just as simmias does not exceed socrates because he
is simmias, any more than because socrates is socrates, but because he
has smallness when compared with the greatness of simmias?

true.

and if phaedo exceeds him in size, this is not because phaedo is
phaedo, but because phaedo has greatness relatively to simmias, who is
comparatively smaller?

that is true.

and therefore simmias is said to be great, and is also said to be small,
because he is in a mean between them, exceeding the smallness of the one
by his greatness, and allowing the greatness of the other to exceed his
smallness. he added, laughing, i am speaking like a book, but i believe
that what i am saying is true.

simmias assented.

i speak as i do because i want you to agree with me in thinking, not
only that absolute greatness will never be great and also small, but
that greatness in us or in the concrete will never admit the small or
admit of being exceeded: instead of this, one of two things will happen,
either the greater will fly or retire before the opposite, which is the
less, or at the approach of the less has already ceased to exist; but
will not, if allowing or admitting of smallness, be changed by that;
even as i, having received and admitted smallness when compared with
simmias, remain just as i was, and am the same small person. and as the
idea of greatness cannot condescend ever to be or become small, in like
manner the smallness in us cannot be or become great; nor can any other
opposite which remains the same ever be or become its own opposite, but
either passes away or perishes in the change.

that, replied cebes, is quite my notion.

hereupon one of the company, though i do not exactly remember which of
them, said: in heaven's name, is not this the direct contrary of what
was admitted before--that out of the greater came the less and out of
the less the greater, and that opposites were simply generated from
opposites; but now this principle seems to be utterly denied.

socrates inclined his head to the speaker and listened. i like your
courage, he said, in reminding us of this. but you do not observe that
there is a difference in the two cases. for then we were speaking of
opposites in the concrete, and now of the essential opposite which, as
is affirmed, neither in us nor in nature can ever be at variance with
itself: then, my friend, we were speaking of things in which opposites
are inherent and which are called after them, but now about the
opposites which are inherent in them and which give their name to them;
and these essential opposites will never, as we maintain, admit of
generation into or out of one another. at the same time, turning to
cebes, he said: are you at all disconcerted, cebes, at our friend's
objection?

no, i do not feel so, said cebes; and yet i cannot deny that i am often
disturbed by objections.

then we are agreed after all, said socrates, that the opposite will
never in any case be opposed to itself?

to that we are quite agreed, he replied.

yet once more let me ask you to consider the question from another point
of view, and see whether you agree with me:--there is a thing which you
term heat, and another thing which you term cold?

certainly.

but are they the same as fire and snow?

most assuredly not.

heat is a thing different from fire, and cold is not the same with snow?

yes.

and yet you will surely admit, that when snow, as was before said, is
under the influence of heat, they will not remain snow and heat; but at
the advance of the heat, the snow will either retire or perish?

very true, he replied.

and the fire too at the advance of the cold will either retire or
perish; and when the fire is under the influence of the cold, they will
not remain as before, fire and cold.

that is true, he said.

and in some cases the name of the idea is not only attached to the idea
in an eternal connection, but anything else which, not being the idea,
exists only in the form of the idea, may also lay claim to it. i will
try to make this clearer by an example:--the odd number is always called
by the name of odd?

very true.

but is this the only thing which is called odd? are there not other
things which have their own name, and yet are called odd, because,
although not the same as oddness, they are never without oddness?--that
is what i mean to ask--whether numbers such as the number three are not
of the class of odd. and there are many other examples: would you not
say, for example, that three may be called by its proper name, and also
be called odd, which is not the same with three? and this may be said
not only of three but also of five, and of every alternate number--each
of them without being oddness is odd, and in the same way two and
four, and the other series of alternate numbers, has every number even,
without being evenness. do you agree?

of course.

then now mark the point at which i am aiming:--not only do essential
opposites exclude one another, but also concrete things, which, although
not in themselves opposed, contain opposites; these, i say, likewise
reject the idea which is opposed to that which is contained in them,
and when it approaches them they either perish or withdraw. for example;
will not the number three endure annihilation or anything sooner than be
converted into an even number, while remaining three?

very true, said cebes.

and yet, he said, the number two is certainly not opposed to the number
three?

it is not.

then not only do opposite ideas repel the advance of one another, but
also there are other natures which repel the approach of opposites.

very true, he said.

suppose, he said, that we endeavour, if possible, to determine what
these are.

by all means.

are they not, cebes, such as compel the things of which they have
possession, not only to take their own form, but also the form of some
opposite?

what do you mean?

i mean, as i was just now saying, and as i am sure that you know, that
those things which are possessed by the number three must not only be
three in number, but must also be odd.

quite true.

and on this oddness, of which the number three has the impress, the
opposite idea will never intrude?

no.

and this impress was given by the odd principle?

yes.

and to the odd is opposed the even?

true.

then the idea of the even number will never arrive at three?

no.

then three has no part in the even?

none.

then the triad or number three is uneven?

very true.

to return then to my distinction of natures which are not opposed, and
yet do not admit opposites--as, in the instance given, three, although
not opposed to the even, does not any the more admit of the even, but
always brings the opposite into play on the other side; or as two does
not receive the odd, or fire the cold--from these examples (and there
are many more of them) perhaps you may be able to arrive at the general
conclusion, that not only opposites will not receive opposites, but also
that nothing which brings the opposite will admit the opposite of
that which it brings, in that to which it is brought. and here let me
recapitulate--for there is no harm in repetition. the number five will
not admit the nature of the even, any more than ten, which is the
double of five, will admit the nature of the odd. the double has another
opposite, and is not strictly opposed to the odd, but nevertheless
rejects the odd altogether. nor again will parts in the ratio 3:2, nor
any fraction in which there is a half, nor again in which there is a
third, admit the notion of the whole, although they are not opposed to
the whole: you will agree?

yes, he said, i entirely agree and go along with you in that.

and now, he said, let us begin again; and do not you answer my question
in the words in which i ask it: let me have not the old safe answer of
which i spoke at first, but another equally safe, of which the truth
will be inferred by you from what has been just said. i mean that if any
one asks you 'what that is, of which the inherence makes the body
hot,' you will reply not heat (this is what i call the safe and
stupid answer), but fire, a far superior answer, which we are now in a
condition to give. or if any one asks you 'why a body is diseased,' you
will not say from disease, but from fever; and instead of saying that
oddness is the cause of odd numbers, you will say that the monad is the
cause of them: and so of things in general, as i dare say that you will
understand sufficiently without my adducing any further examples.

yes, he said, i quite understand you.

tell me, then, what is that of which the inherence will render the body
alive?

the soul, he replied.

and is this always the case?

yes, he said, of course.

then whatever the soul possesses, to that she comes bearing life?

yes, certainly.

and is there any opposite to life?

there is, he said.

and what is that?

death.

then the soul, as has been acknowledged, will never receive the opposite
of what she brings.

impossible, replied cebes.

and now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels
the even?

the odd.

and that principle which repels the musical, or the just?

the unmusical, he said, and the unjust.

and what do we call the principle which does not admit of death?

the immortal, he said.

and does the soul admit of death?

no.

then the soul is immortal?

yes, he said.

and may we say that this has been proven?

yes, abundantly proven, socrates, he replied.

supposing that the odd were imperishable, must not three be
imperishable?

of course.

and if that which is cold were imperishable, when the warm principle
came attacking the snow, must not the snow have retired whole and
unmelted--for it could never have perished, nor could it have remained
and admitted the heat?

true, he said.

again, if the uncooling or warm principle were imperishable, the fire
when assailed by cold would not have perished or have been extinguished,
but would have gone away unaffected?

certainly, he said.

and the same may be said of the immortal: if the immortal is also
imperishable, the soul when attacked by death cannot perish; for the
preceding argument shows that the soul will not admit of death, or ever
be dead, any more than three or the odd number will admit of the even,
or fire or the heat in the fire, of the cold. yet a person may say: 'but
although the odd will not become even at the approach of the even, why
may not the odd perish and the even take the place of the odd?' now to
him who makes this objection, we cannot answer that the odd principle is
imperishable; for this has not been acknowledged, but if this had been
acknowledged, there would have been no difficulty in contending that
at the approach of the even the odd principle and the number three took
their departure; and the same argument would have held good of fire and
heat and any other thing.

very true.

and the same may be said of the immortal: if the immortal is also
imperishable, then the soul will be imperishable as well as immortal;
but if not, some other proof of her imperishableness will have to be
given.

no other proof is needed, he said; for if the immortal, being eternal,
is liable to perish, then nothing is imperishable.

yes, replied socrates, and yet all men will agree that god, and the
essential form of life, and the immortal in general, will never perish.

yes, all men, he said--that is true; and what is more, gods, if i am not
mistaken, as well as men.

seeing then that the immortal is indestructible, must not the soul, if
she is immortal, be also imperishable?

most certainly.

then when death attacks a man, the mortal portion of him may be supposed
to die, but the immortal retires at the approach of death and is
preserved safe and sound?

true.

then, cebes, beyond question, the soul is immortal and imperishable, and
our souls will truly exist in another world!

i am convinced, socrates, said cebes, and have nothing more to object;
but if my friend simmias, or any one else, has any further objection to
make, he had better speak out, and not keep silence, since i do not know
to what other season he can defer the discussion, if there is anything
which he wants to say or to have said.

but i have nothing more to say, replied simmias; nor can i see any
reason for doubt after what has been said. but i still feel and cannot
help feeling uncertain in my own mind, when i think of the greatness of
the subject and the feebleness of man.

yes, simmias, replied socrates, that is well said: and i may add that
first principles, even if they appear certain, should be carefully
considered; and when they are satisfactorily ascertained, then, with a
sort of hesitating confidence in human reason, you may, i think, follow
the course of the argument; and if that be plain and clear, there will
be no need for any further enquiry.

very true.

but then, o my friends, he said, if the soul is really immortal, what
care should be taken of her, not only in respect of the portion of time
which is called life, but of eternity! and the danger of neglecting her
from this point of view does indeed appear to be awful. if death had
only been the end of all, the wicked would have had a good bargain in
dying, for they would have been happily quit not only of their body, but
of their own evil together with their souls. but now, inasmuch as the
soul is manifestly immortal, there is no release or salvation from evil
except the attainment of the highest virtue and wisdom. for the soul
when on her progress to the world below takes nothing with her but
nurture and education; and these are said greatly to benefit or greatly
to injure the departed, at the very beginning of his journey thither.

for after death, as they say, the genius of each individual, to whom
he belonged in life, leads him to a certain place in which the dead are
gathered together, whence after judgment has been given they pass into
the world below, following the guide, who is appointed to conduct them
from this world to the other: and when they have there received their
due and remained their time, another guide brings them back again after
many revolutions of ages. now this way to the other world is not, as
aeschylus says in the telephus, a single and straight path--if that were
so no guide would be needed, for no one could miss it; but there are
many partings of the road, and windings, as i infer from the rites and
sacrifices which are offered to the gods below in places where three
ways meet on earth. the wise and orderly soul follows in the straight
path and is conscious of her surroundings; but the soul which desires
the body, and which, as i was relating before, has long been fluttering
about the lifeless frame and the world of sight, is after many struggles
and many sufferings hardly and with violence carried away by her
attendant genius, and when she arrives at the place where the other
souls are gathered, if she be impure and have done impure deeds, whether
foul murders or other crimes which are the brothers of these, and the
works of brothers in crime--from that soul every one flees and turns
away; no one will be her companion, no one her guide, but alone she
wanders in extremity of evil until certain times are fulfilled, and
when they are fulfilled, she is borne irresistibly to her own fitting
habitation; as every pure and just soul which has passed through life in
the company and under the guidance of the gods has also her own proper
home.

now the earth has divers wonderful regions, and is indeed in nature
and extent very unlike the notions of geographers, as i believe on the
authority of one who shall be nameless.

what do you mean, socrates? said simmias. i have myself heard many
descriptions of the earth, but i do not know, and i should very much
like to know, in which of these you put faith.

and i, simmias, replied socrates, if i had the art of glaucus would tell
you; although i know not that the art of glaucus could prove the truth
of my tale, which i myself should never be able to prove, and even if
i could, i fear, simmias, that my life would come to an end before the
argument was completed. i may describe to you, however, the form and
regions of the earth according to my conception of them.

that, said simmias, will be enough.

well, then, he said, my conviction is, that the earth is a round body
in the centre of the heavens, and therefore has no need of air or any
similar force to be a support, but is kept there and hindered from
falling or inclining any way by the equability of the surrounding heaven
and by her own equipoise. for that which, being in equipoise, is in the
centre of that which is equably diffused, will not incline any way in
any degree, but will always remain in the same state and not deviate.
and this is my first notion.

which is surely a correct one, said simmias.

also i believe that the earth is very vast, and that we who dwell in
the region extending from the river phasis to the pillars of heracles
inhabit a small portion only about the sea, like ants or frogs about a
marsh, and that there are other inhabitants of many other like places;
for everywhere on the face of the earth there are hollows of various
forms and sizes, into which the water and the mist and the lower
air collect. but the true earth is pure and situated in the pure
heaven--there are the stars also; and it is the heaven which is commonly
spoken of by us as the ether, and of which our own earth is the sediment
gathering in the hollows beneath. but we who live in these hollows are
deceived into the notion that we are dwelling above on the surface of
the earth; which is just as if a creature who was at the bottom of the
sea were to fancy that he was on the surface of the water, and that the
sea was the heaven through which he saw the sun and the other stars,
he having never come to the surface by reason of his feebleness and
sluggishness, and having never lifted up his head and seen, nor ever
heard from one who had seen, how much purer and fairer the world above
is than his own. and such is exactly our case: for we are dwelling in a
hollow of the earth, and fancy that we are on the surface; and the air
we call the heaven, in which we imagine that the stars move. but the
fact is, that owing to our feebleness and sluggishness we are prevented
from reaching the surface of the air: for if any man could arrive at the
exterior limit, or take the wings of a bird and come to the top, then
like a fish who puts his head out of the water and sees this world, he
would see a world beyond; and, if the nature of man could sustain the
sight, he would acknowledge that this other world was the place of the
true heaven and the true light and the true earth. for our earth, and
the stones, and the entire region which surrounds us, are spoilt and
corroded, as in the sea all things are corroded by the brine, neither
is there any noble or perfect growth, but caverns only, and sand, and an
endless slough of mud: and even the shore is not to be compared to the
fairer sights of this world. and still less is this our world to be
compared with the other. of that upper earth which is under the heaven,
i can tell you a charming tale, simmias, which is well worth hearing.

and we, socrates, replied simmias, shall be charmed to listen to you.

the tale, my friend, he said, is as follows:--in the first place, the
earth, when looked at from above, is in appearance streaked like one of
those balls which have leather coverings in twelve pieces, and is decked
with various colours, of which the colours used by painters on earth are
in a manner samples. but there the whole earth is made up of them,
and they are brighter far and clearer than ours; there is a purple of
wonderful lustre, also the radiance of gold, and the white which is in
the earth is whiter than any chalk or snow. of these and other colours
the earth is made up, and they are more in number and fairer than the
eye of man has ever seen; the very hollows (of which i was speaking)
filled with air and water have a colour of their own, and are seen like
light gleaming amid the diversity of the other colours, so that the
whole presents a single and continuous appearance of variety in unity.
and in this fair region everything that grows--trees, and flowers, and
fruits--are in a like degree fairer than any here; and there are hills,
having stones in them in a like degree smoother, and more transparent,
and fairer in colour than our highly-valued emeralds and sardonyxes and
jaspers, and other gems, which are but minute fragments of them: for
there all the stones are like our precious stones, and fairer still
(compare republic). the reason is, that they are pure, and not, like
our precious stones, infected or corroded by the corrupt briny elements
which coagulate among us, and which breed foulness and disease both in
earth and stones, as well as in animals and plants. they are the jewels
of the upper earth, which also shines with gold and silver and the like,
and they are set in the light of day and are large and abundant and in
all places, making the earth a sight to gladden the beholder's eye.
and there are animals and men, some in a middle region, others dwelling
about the air as we dwell about the sea; others in islands which the air
flows round, near the continent: and in a word, the air is used by them
as the water and the sea are by us, and the ether is to them what the
air is to us. moreover, the temperament of their seasons is such that
they have no disease, and live much longer than we do, and have
sight and hearing and smell, and all the other senses, in far greater
perfection, in the same proportion that air is purer than water or the
ether than air. also they have temples and sacred places in which the
gods really dwell, and they hear their voices and receive their answers,
and are conscious of them and hold converse with them, and they see the
sun, moon, and stars as they truly are, and their other blessedness is
of a piece with this.

such is the nature of the whole earth, and of the things which are
around the earth; and there are divers regions in the hollows on the
face of the globe everywhere, some of them deeper and more extended than
that which we inhabit, others deeper but with a narrower opening
than ours, and some are shallower and also wider. all have numerous
perforations, and there are passages broad and narrow in the interior of
the earth, connecting them with one another; and there flows out of and
into them, as into basins, a vast tide of water, and huge subterranean
streams of perennial rivers, and springs hot and cold, and a great fire,
and great rivers of fire, and streams of liquid mud, thin or thick (like
the rivers of mud in sicily, and the lava streams which follow them),
and the regions about which they happen to flow are filled up with them.
and there is a swinging or see-saw in the interior of the earth which
moves all this up and down, and is due to the following cause:--there is
a chasm which is the vastest of them all, and pierces right through the
whole earth; this is that chasm which homer describes in the words,--

     'far off, where is the inmost depth beneath the earth;'

and which he in other places, and many other poets, have called
tartarus. and the see-saw is caused by the streams flowing into and out
of this chasm, and they each have the nature of the soil through which
they flow. and the reason why the streams are always flowing in and out,
is that the watery element has no bed or bottom, but is swinging and
surging up and down, and the surrounding wind and air do the same; they
follow the water up and down, hither and thither, over the earth--just
as in the act of respiration the air is always in process of inhalation
and exhalation;--and the wind swinging with the water in and out
produces fearful and irresistible blasts: when the waters retire with
a rush into the lower parts of the earth, as they are called, they flow
through the earth in those regions, and fill them up like water raised
by a pump, and then when they leave those regions and rush back hither,
they again fill the hollows here, and when these are filled, flow
through subterranean channels and find their way to their several
places, forming seas, and lakes, and rivers, and springs. thence they
again enter the earth, some of them making a long circuit into many
lands, others going to a few places and not so distant; and again fall
into tartarus, some at a point a good deal lower than that at which they
rose, and others not much lower, but all in some degree lower than the
point from which they came. and some burst forth again on the opposite
side, and some on the same side, and some wind round the earth with one
or many folds like the coils of a serpent, and descend as far as they
can, but always return and fall into the chasm. the rivers flowing in
either direction can descend only to the centre and no further, for
opposite to the rivers is a precipice.

now these rivers are many, and mighty, and diverse, and there are four
principal ones, of which the greatest and outermost is that called
oceanus, which flows round the earth in a circle; and in the opposite
direction flows acheron, which passes under the earth through desert
places into the acherusian lake: this is the lake to the shores of
which the souls of the many go when they are dead, and after waiting an
appointed time, which is to some a longer and to some a shorter time,
they are sent back to be born again as animals. the third river passes
out between the two, and near the place of outlet pours into a vast
region of fire, and forms a lake larger than the mediterranean sea,
boiling with water and mud; and proceeding muddy and turbid, and winding
about the earth, comes, among other places, to the extremities of the
acherusian lake, but mingles not with the waters of the lake, and after
making many coils about the earth plunges into tartarus at a deeper
level. this is that pyriphlegethon, as the stream is called, which
throws up jets of fire in different parts of the earth. the fourth river
goes out on the opposite side, and falls first of all into a wild and
savage region, which is all of a dark-blue colour, like lapis lazuli;
and this is that river which is called the stygian river, and falls into
and forms the lake styx, and after falling into the lake and receiving
strange powers in the waters, passes under the earth, winding round
in the opposite direction, and comes near the acherusian lake from the
opposite side to pyriphlegethon. and the water of this river too mingles
with no other, but flows round in a circle and falls into tartarus over
against pyriphlegethon; and the name of the river, as the poets say, is
cocytus.

such is the nature of the other world; and when the dead arrive at the
place to which the genius of each severally guides them, first of all,
they have sentence passed upon them, as they have lived well and piously
or not. and those who appear to have lived neither well nor ill, go to
the river acheron, and embarking in any vessels which they may find, are
carried in them to the lake, and there they dwell and are purified of
their evil deeds, and having suffered the penalty of the wrongs which
they have done to others, they are absolved, and receive the rewards of
their good deeds, each of them according to his deserts. but those who
appear to be incurable by reason of the greatness of their crimes--who
have committed many and terrible deeds of sacrilege, murders foul and
violent, or the like--such are hurled into tartarus which is their
suitable destiny, and they never come out. those again who have
committed crimes, which, although great, are not irremediable--who in
a moment of anger, for example, have done violence to a father or a
mother, and have repented for the remainder of their lives, or, who
have taken the life of another under the like extenuating
circumstances--these are plunged into tartarus, the pains of which they
are compelled to undergo for a year, but at the end of the year the
wave casts them forth--mere homicides by way of cocytus, parricides and
matricides by pyriphlegethon--and they are borne to the acherusian lake,
and there they lift up their voices and call upon the victims whom they
have slain or wronged, to have pity on them, and to be kind to them,
and let them come out into the lake. and if they prevail, then they come
forth and cease from their troubles; but if not, they are carried back
again into tartarus and from thence into the rivers unceasingly, until
they obtain mercy from those whom they have wronged: for that is the
sentence inflicted upon them by their judges. those too who have been
pre-eminent for holiness of life are released from this earthly prison,
and go to their pure home which is above, and dwell in the purer earth;
and of these, such as have duly purified themselves with philosophy live
henceforth altogether without the body, in mansions fairer still which
may not be described, and of which the time would fail me to tell.

wherefore, simmias, seeing all these things, what ought not we to do
that we may obtain virtue and wisdom in this life? fair is the prize,
and the hope great!

a man of sense ought not to say, nor will i be very confident, that the
description which i have given of the soul and her mansions is exactly
true. but i do say that, inasmuch as the soul is shown to be immortal,
he may venture to think, not improperly or unworthily, that something of
the kind is true. the venture is a glorious one, and he ought to comfort
himself with words like these, which is the reason why i lengthen out
the tale. wherefore, i say, let a man be of good cheer about his soul,
who having cast away the pleasures and ornaments of the body as alien to
him and working harm rather than good, has sought after the pleasures of
knowledge; and has arrayed the soul, not in some foreign attire, but
in her own proper jewels, temperance, and justice, and courage, and
nobility, and truth--in these adorned she is ready to go on her journey
to the world below, when her hour comes. you, simmias and cebes, and all
other men, will depart at some time or other. me already, as the tragic
poet would say, the voice of fate calls. soon i must drink the poison;
and i think that i had better repair to the bath first, in order that
the women may not have the trouble of washing my body after i am dead.

when he had done speaking, crito said: and have you any commands for us,
socrates--anything to say about your children, or any other matter in
which we can serve you?

nothing particular, crito, he replied: only, as i have always told
you, take care of yourselves; that is a service which you may be ever
rendering to me and mine and to all of us, whether you promise to do so
or not. but if you have no thought for yourselves, and care not to walk
according to the rule which i have prescribed for you, not now for the
first time, however much you may profess or promise at the moment, it
will be of no avail.

we will do our best, said crito: and in what way shall we bury you?

in any way that you like; but you must get hold of me, and take care
that i do not run away from you. then he turned to us, and added with a
smile:--i cannot make crito believe that i am the same socrates who have
been talking and conducting the argument; he fancies that i am the other
socrates whom he will soon see, a dead body--and he asks, how shall he
bury me? and though i have spoken many words in the endeavour to show
that when i have drunk the poison i shall leave you and go to the joys
of the blessed,--these words of mine, with which i was comforting you
and myself, have had, as i perceive, no effect upon crito. and therefore
i want you to be surety for me to him now, as at the trial he was surety
to the judges for me: but let the promise be of another sort; for he
was surety for me to the judges that i would remain, and you must be my
surety to him that i shall not remain, but go away and depart; and then
he will suffer less at my death, and not be grieved when he sees my body
being burned or buried. i would not have him sorrow at my hard lot, or
say at the burial, thus we lay out socrates, or, thus we follow him to
the grave or bury him; for false words are not only evil in themselves,
but they infect the soul with evil. be of good cheer, then, my dear
crito, and say that you are burying my body only, and do with that
whatever is usual, and what you think best.

when he had spoken these words, he arose and went into a chamber to
bathe; crito followed him and told us to wait. so we remained behind,
talking and thinking of the subject of discourse, and also of the
greatness of our sorrow; he was like a father of whom we were being
bereaved, and we were about to pass the rest of our lives as orphans.
when he had taken the bath his children were brought to him--(he had two
young sons and an elder one); and the women of his family also came,
and he talked to them and gave them a few directions in the presence of
crito; then he dismissed them and returned to us.

now the hour of sunset was near, for a good deal of time had passed
while he was within. when he came out, he sat down with us again after
his bath, but not much was said. soon the jailer, who was the servant of
the eleven, entered and stood by him, saying:--to you, socrates, whom
i know to be the noblest and gentlest and best of all who ever came to
this place, i will not impute the angry feelings of other men, who rage
and swear at me, when, in obedience to the authorities, i bid them drink
the poison--indeed, i am sure that you will not be angry with me; for
others, as you are aware, and not i, are to blame. and so fare you well,
and try to bear lightly what must needs be--you know my errand. then
bursting into tears he turned away and went out.

socrates looked at him and said: i return your good wishes, and will do
as you bid. then turning to us, he said, how charming the man is: since
i have been in prison he has always been coming to see me, and at times
he would talk to me, and was as good to me as could be, and now see how
generously he sorrows on my account. we must do as he says, crito; and
therefore let the cup be brought, if the poison is prepared: if not, let
the attendant prepare some.

yet, said crito, the sun is still upon the hill-tops, and i know that
many a one has taken the draught late, and after the announcement has
been made to him, he has eaten and drunk, and enjoyed the society of his
beloved; do not hurry--there is time enough.

socrates said: yes, crito, and they of whom you speak are right in so
acting, for they think that they will be gainers by the delay; but i am
right in not following their example, for i do not think that i should
gain anything by drinking the poison a little later; i should only be
ridiculous in my own eyes for sparing and saving a life which is already
forfeit. please then to do as i say, and not to refuse me.

crito made a sign to the servant, who was standing by; and he went out,
and having been absent for some time, returned with the jailer
carrying the cup of poison. socrates said: you, my good friend, who
are experienced in these matters, shall give me directions how i am to
proceed. the man answered: you have only to walk about until your legs
are heavy, and then to lie down, and the poison will act. at the same
time he handed the cup to socrates, who in the easiest and gentlest
manner, without the least fear or change of colour or feature, looking
at the man with all his eyes, echecrates, as his manner was, took the
cup and said: what do you say about making a libation out of this cup
to any god? may i, or not? the man answered: we only prepare, socrates,
just so much as we deem enough. i understand, he said: but i may
and must ask the gods to prosper my journey from this to the other
world--even so--and so be it according to my prayer. then raising the
cup to his lips, quite readily and cheerfully he drank off the poison.
and hitherto most of us had been able to control our sorrow; but now
when we saw him drinking, and saw too that he had finished the draught,
we could no longer forbear, and in spite of myself my own tears were
flowing fast; so that i covered my face and wept, not for him, but at
the thought of my own calamity in having to part from such a friend. nor
was i the first; for crito, when he found himself unable to restrain his
tears, had got up, and i followed; and at that moment, apollodorus, who
had been weeping all the time, broke out in a loud and passionate cry
which made cowards of us all. socrates alone retained his calmness: what
is this strange outcry? he said. i sent away the women mainly in order
that they might not misbehave in this way, for i have been told that
a man should die in peace. be quiet, then, and have patience. when we
heard his words we were ashamed, and refrained our tears; and he walked
about until, as he said, his legs began to fail, and then he lay on his
back, according to the directions, and the man who gave him the poison
now and then looked at his feet and legs; and after a while he pressed
his foot hard, and asked him if he could feel; and he said, no; and then
his leg, and so upwards and upwards, and showed us that he was cold and
stiff. and he felt them himself, and said: when the poison reaches the
heart, that will be the end. he was beginning to grow cold about the
groin, when he uncovered his face, for he had covered himself up,
and said--they were his last words--he said: crito, i owe a cock to
asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt? the debt shall be
paid, said crito; is there anything else? there was no answer to
this question; but in a minute or two a movement was heard, and the
attendants uncovered him; his eyes were set, and crito closed his eyes
and mouth.

such was the end, echecrates, of our friend; concerning whom i may
truly say, that of all the men of his time whom i have known, he was the
wisest and justest and best.

introduction.

this dialogue begins abruptly with a question of meno, who asks,
'whether virtue can be taught.' socrates replies that he does not as yet
know what virtue is, and has never known anyone who did. 'then he cannot
have met gorgias when he was at athens.' yes, socrates had met him, but
he has a bad memory, and has forgotten what gorgias said. will meno tell
him his own notion, which is probably not very different from that of
gorgias? 'o yes--nothing easier: there is the virtue of a man, of a
woman, of an old man, and of a child; there is a virtue of every age and
state of life, all of which may be easily described.'

socrates reminds meno that this is only an enumeration of the virtues
and not a definition of the notion which is common to them all. in a
second attempt meno defines virtue to be 'the power of command.' but to
this, again, exceptions are taken. for there must be a virtue of those
who obey, as well as of those who command; and the power of command must
be justly or not unjustly exercised. meno is very ready to admit that
justice is virtue: 'would you say virtue or a virtue, for there are
other virtues, such as courage, temperance, and the like; just as round
is a figure, and black and white are colours, and yet there are other
figures and other colours. let meno take the examples of figure and
colour, and try to define them.' meno confesses his inability, and after
a process of interrogation, in which socrates explains to him the
nature of a 'simile in multis,' socrates himself defines figure as 'the
accompaniment of colour.' but some one may object that he does not know
the meaning of the word 'colour;' and if he is a candid friend, and not
a mere disputant, socrates is willing to furnish him with a simpler and
more philosophical definition, into which no disputed word is allowed to
intrude: 'figure is the limit of form.' meno imperiously insists that
he must still have a definition of colour. some raillery follows; and
at length socrates is induced to reply, 'that colour is the effluence of
form, sensible, and in due proportion to the sight.' this definition is
exactly suited to the taste of meno, who welcomes the familiar language
of gorgias and empedocles. socrates is of opinion that the more abstract
or dialectical definition of figure is far better.

now that meno has been made to understand the nature of a general
definition, he answers in the spirit of a greek gentleman, and in the
words of a poet, 'that virtue is to delight in things honourable, and to
have the power of getting them.' this is a nearer approximation than
he has yet made to a complete definition, and, regarded as a piece
of proverbial or popular morality, is not far from the truth. but the
objection is urged, 'that the honourable is the good,' and as every one
equally desires the good, the point of the definition is contained in
the words, 'the power of getting them.' 'and they must be got justly or
with justice.' the definition will then stand thus: 'virtue is the power
of getting good with justice.' but justice is a part of virtue, and
therefore virtue is the getting of good with a part of virtue. the
definition repeats the word defined.

meno complains that the conversation of socrates has the effect of a
torpedo's shock upon him. when he talks with other persons he has plenty
to say about virtue; in the presence of socrates, his thoughts desert
him. socrates replies that he is only the cause of perplexity in others,
because he is himself perplexed. he proposes to continue the enquiry.
but how, asks meno, can he enquire either into what he knows or into
what he does not know? this is a sophistical puzzle, which, as socrates
remarks, saves a great deal of trouble to him who accepts it. but the
puzzle has a real difficulty latent under it, to which socrates will
endeavour to find a reply. the difficulty is the origin of knowledge:--

he has heard from priests and priestesses, and from the poet pindar, of
an immortal soul which is born again and again in successive periods of
existence, returning into this world when she has paid the penalty of
ancient crime, and, having wandered over all places of the upper and
under world, and seen and known all things at one time or other, is by
association out of one thing capable of recovering all. for nature is
of one kindred; and every soul has a seed or germ which may be developed
into all knowledge. the existence of this latent knowledge is further
proved by the interrogation of one of meno's slaves, who, in the skilful
hands of socrates, is made to acknowledge some elementary relations
of geometrical figures. the theorem that the square of the diagonal
is double the square of the side--that famous discovery of primitive
mathematics, in honour of which the legendary pythagoras is said to
have sacrificed a hecatomb--is elicited from him. the first step in the
process of teaching has made him conscious of his own ignorance. he
has had the 'torpedo's shock' given him, and is the better for the
operation. but whence had the uneducated man this knowledge? he had
never learnt geometry in this world; nor was it born with him; he must
therefore have had it when he was not a man. and as he always either was
or was not a man, he must have always had it. (compare phaedo.)

after socrates has given this specimen of the true nature of teaching,
the original question of the teachableness of virtue is renewed. again
he professes a desire to know 'what virtue is' first. but he is willing
to argue the question, as mathematicians say, under an hypothesis. he
will assume that if virtue is knowledge, then virtue can be taught.
(this was the stage of the argument at which the protagoras concluded.)

socrates has no difficulty in showing that virtue is a good, and
that goods, whether of body or mind, must be under the direction of
knowledge. upon the assumption just made, then, virtue is teachable. but
where are the teachers? there are none to be found. this is extremely
discouraging. virtue is no sooner discovered to be teachable, than the
discovery follows that it is not taught. virtue, therefore, is and is
not teachable.

in this dilemma an appeal is made to anytus, a respectable and
well-to-do citizen of the old school, and a family friend of meno,
who happens to be present. he is asked 'whether meno shall go to the
sophists and be taught.' the suggestion throws him into a rage. 'to
whom, then, shall meno go?' asks socrates. to any athenian gentleman--to
the great athenian statesmen of past times. socrates replies here, as
elsewhere (laches, prot.), that themistocles, pericles, and other great
men, had sons to whom they would surely, if they could have done so,
have imparted their own political wisdom; but no one ever heard that
these sons of theirs were remarkable for anything except riding and
wrestling and similar accomplishments. anytus is angry at the imputation
which is cast on his favourite statesmen, and on a class to which he
supposes himself to belong; he breaks off with a significant hint. the
mention of another opportunity of talking with him, and the suggestion
that meno may do the athenian people a service by pacifying him, are
evident allusions to the trial of socrates.

socrates returns to the consideration of the question 'whether virtue is
teachable,' which was denied on the ground that there are no teachers of
it: (for the sophists are bad teachers, and the rest of the world do
not profess to teach). but there is another point which we failed to
observe, and in which gorgias has never instructed meno, nor prodicus
socrates. this is the nature of right opinion. for virtue may be under
the guidance of right opinion as well as of knowledge; and right opinion
is for practical purposes as good as knowledge, but is incapable of
being taught, and is also liable, like the images of daedalus, to 'walk
off,' because not bound by the tie of the cause. this is the sort of
instinct which is possessed by statesmen, who are not wise or knowing
persons, but only inspired or divine. the higher virtue, which is
identical with knowledge, is an ideal only. if the statesman had this
knowledge, and could teach what he knew, he would be like tiresias in
the world below,--'he alone has wisdom, but the rest flit like shadows.'

this dialogue is an attempt to answer the question, can virtue be
taught? no one would either ask or answer such a question in modern
times. but in the age of socrates it was only by an effort that the mind
could rise to a general notion of virtue as distinct from the particular
virtues of courage, liberality, and the like. and when a hazy conception
of this ideal was attained, it was only by a further effort that the
question of the teachableness of virtue could be resolved.

the answer which is given by plato is paradoxical enough, and seems
rather intended to stimulate than to satisfy enquiry. virtue is
knowledge, and therefore virtue can be taught. but virtue is not taught,
and therefore in this higher and ideal sense there is no virtue and no
knowledge. the teaching of the sophists is confessedly inadequate, and
meno, who is their pupil, is ignorant of the very nature of general
terms. he can only produce out of their armoury the sophism, 'that you
can neither enquire into what you know nor into what you do not know;'
to which socrates replies by his theory of reminiscence.

to the doctrine that virtue is knowledge, plato has been constantly
tending in the previous dialogues. but the new truth is no sooner found
than it vanishes away. 'if there is knowledge, there must be teachers;
and where are the teachers?' there is no knowledge in the higher sense
of systematic, connected, reasoned knowledge, such as may one day be
attained, and such as plato himself seems to see in some far off vision
of a single science. and there are no teachers in the higher sense of
the word; that is to say, no real teachers who will arouse the spirit
of enquiry in their pupils, and not merely instruct them in rhetoric or
impart to them ready-made information for a fee of 'one' or of 'fifty
drachms.' plato is desirous of deepening the notion of education, and
therefore he asserts the paradox that there are no educators. this
paradox, though different in form, is not really different from the
remark which is often made in modern times by those who would depreciate
either the methods of education commonly employed, or the standard
attained--that 'there is no true education among us.'

there remains still a possibility which must not be overlooked. even
if there be no true knowledge, as is proved by 'the wretched state of
education,' there may be right opinion, which is a sort of guessing
or divination resting on no knowledge of causes, and incommunicable to
others. this is the gift which our statesmen have, as is proved by the
circumstance that they are unable to impart their knowledge to their
sons. those who are possessed of it cannot be said to be men of science
or philosophers, but they are inspired and divine.

there may be some trace of irony in this curious passage, which forms
the concluding portion of the dialogue. but plato certainly does not
mean to intimate that the supernatural or divine is the true basis of
human life. to him knowledge, if only attainable in this world, is of
all things the most divine. yet, like other philosophers, he is willing
to admit that 'probability is the guide of life (butler's analogy.);'
and he is at the same time desirous of contrasting the wisdom which
governs the world with a higher wisdom. there are many instincts,
judgments, and anticipations of the human mind which cannot be reduced
to rule, and of which the grounds cannot always be given in words. a
person may have some skill or latent experience which he is able to use
himself and is yet unable to teach others, because he has no principles,
and is incapable of collecting or arranging his ideas. he has practice,
but not theory; art, but not science. this is a true fact of psychology,
which is recognized by plato in this passage. but he is far from
saying, as some have imagined, that inspiration or divine grace is to be
regarded as higher than knowledge. he would not have preferred the poet
or man of action to the philosopher, or the virtue of custom to the
virtue based upon ideas.

also here, as in the ion and phaedrus, plato appears to acknowledge an
unreasoning element in the higher nature of man. the philosopher only
has knowledge, and yet the statesman and the poet are inspired. there
may be a sort of irony in regarding in this way the gifts of genius. but
there is no reason to suppose that he is deriding them, any more than he
is deriding the phenomena of love or of enthusiasm in the symposium, or
of oracles in the apology, or of divine intimations when he is speaking
of the daemonium of socrates. he recognizes the lower form of right
opinion, as well as the higher one of science, in the spirit of one who
desires to include in his philosophy every aspect of human life; just
as he recognizes the existence of popular opinion as a fact, and the
sophists as the expression of it.

this dialogue contains the first intimation of the doctrine of
reminiscence and of the immortality of the soul. the proof is very
slight, even slighter than in the phaedo and republic. because men had
abstract ideas in a previous state, they must have always had them, and
their souls therefore must have always existed. for they must always
have been either men or not men. the fallacy of the latter words is
transparent. and socrates himself appears to be conscious of their
weakness; for he adds immediately afterwards, 'i have said some things
of which i am not altogether confident.' (compare phaedo.) it may be
observed, however, that the fanciful notion of pre-existence is combined
with a true but partial view of the origin and unity of knowledge,
and of the association of ideas. knowledge is prior to any particular
knowledge, and exists not in the previous state of the individual, but
of the race. it is potential, not actual, and can only be appropriated
by strenuous exertion.

the idealism of plato is here presented in a less developed form than in
the phaedo and phaedrus. nothing is said of the pre-existence of ideas
of justice, temperance, and the like. nor is socrates positive of
anything but the duty of enquiry. the doctrine of reminiscence too is
explained more in accordance with fact and experience as arising out of
the affinities of nature (ate tes thuseos oles suggenous ouses). modern
philosophy says that all things in nature are dependent on one another;
the ancient philosopher had the same truth latent in his mind when
he affirmed that out of one thing all the rest may be recovered. the
subjective was converted by him into an objective; the mental phenomenon
of the association of ideas (compare phaedo) became a real chain of
existences. the germs of two valuable principles of education may also
be gathered from the 'words of priests and priestesses:' (1) that
true knowledge is a knowledge of causes (compare aristotle's theory of
episteme); and (2) that the process of learning consists not in what is
brought to the learner, but in what is drawn out of him.

some lesser points of the dialogue may be noted, such as (1) the
acute observation that meno prefers the familiar definition, which is
embellished with poetical language, to the better and truer one; or (2)
the shrewd reflection, which may admit of an application to modern
as well as to ancient teachers, that the sophists having made large
fortunes; this must surely be a criterion of their powers of teaching,
for that no man could get a living by shoemaking who was not a good
shoemaker; or (3) the remark conveyed, almost in a word, that the verbal
sceptic is saved the labour of thought and enquiry (ouden dei to toiouto
zeteseos). characteristic also of the temper of the socratic enquiry
is, (4) the proposal to discuss the teachableness of virtue under
an hypothesis, after the manner of the mathematicians; and (5) the
repetition of the favourite doctrine which occurs so frequently in
the earlier and more socratic dialogues, and gives a colour to all
of them--that mankind only desire evil through ignorance; (6) the
experiment of eliciting from the slave-boy the mathematical truth which
is latent in him, and (7) the remark that he is all the better for
knowing his ignorance.

the character of meno, like that of critias, has no relation to the
actual circumstances of his life. plato is silent about his treachery
to the ten thousand greeks, which xenophon has recorded, as he is also
silent about the crimes of critias. he is a thessalian alcibiades,
rich and luxurious--a spoilt child of fortune, and is described as the
hereditary friend of the great king. like alcibiades he is inspired
with an ardent desire of knowledge, and is equally willing to learn of
socrates and of the sophists. he may be regarded as standing in the same
relation to gorgias as hippocrates in the protagoras to the other
great sophist. he is the sophisticated youth on whom socrates tries his
cross-examining powers, just as in the charmides, the lysis, and
the euthydemus, ingenuous boyhood is made the subject of a similar
experiment. he is treated by socrates in a half-playful manner suited to
his character; at the same time he appears not quite to understand the
process to which he is being subjected. for he is exhibited as ignorant
of the very elements of dialectics, in which the sophists have failed
to instruct their disciple. his definition of virtue as 'the power and
desire of attaining things honourable,' like the first definition
of justice in the republic, is taken from a poet. his answers have a
sophistical ring, and at the same time show the sophistical incapacity
to grasp a general notion.

anytus is the type of the narrow-minded man of the world, who is
indignant at innovation, and equally detests the popular teacher and
the true philosopher. he seems, like aristophanes, to regard the new
opinions, whether of socrates or the sophists, as fatal to athenian
greatness. he is of the same class as callicles in the gorgias, but of
a different variety; the immoral and sophistical doctrines of callicles
are not attributed to him. the moderation with which he is described is
remarkable, if he be the accuser of socrates, as is apparently indicated
by his parting words. perhaps plato may have been desirous of showing
that the accusation of socrates was not to be attributed to badness or
malevolence, but rather to a tendency in men's minds. or he may have
been regardless of the historical truth of the characters of his
dialogue, as in the case of meno and critias. like chaerephon (apol.)
the real anytus was a democrat, and had joined thrasybulus in the
conflict with the thirty.

the protagoras arrived at a sort of hypothetical conclusion, that if
'virtue is knowledge, it can be taught.' in the euthydemus, socrates
himself offered an example of the manner in which the true teacher
may draw out the mind of youth; this was in contrast to the quibbling
follies of the sophists. in the meno the subject is more developed; the
foundations of the enquiry are laid deeper, and the nature of knowledge
is more distinctly explained. there is a progression by antagonism of
two opposite aspects of philosophy. but at the moment when we approach
nearest, the truth doubles upon us and passes out of our reach. we seem
to find that the ideal of knowledge is irreconcilable with experience.
in human life there is indeed the profession of knowledge, but right
opinion is our actual guide. there is another sort of progress from the
general notions of socrates, who asked simply, 'what is friendship?'
'what is temperance?' 'what is courage?' as in the lysis, charmides,
laches, to the transcendentalism of plato, who, in the second stage of
his philosophy, sought to find the nature of knowledge in a prior and
future state of existence.

the difficulty in framing general notions which has appeared in this and
in all the previous dialogues recurs in the gorgias and theaetetus as
well as in the republic. in the gorgias too the statesmen reappear, but
in stronger opposition to the philosopher. they are no longer allowed to
have a divine insight, but, though acknowledged to have been clever men
and good speakers, are denounced as 'blind leaders of the blind.' the
doctrine of the immortality of the soul is also carried further, being
made the foundation not only of a theory of knowledge, but of a doctrine
of rewards and punishments. in the republic the relation of knowledge
to virtue is described in a manner more consistent with modern
distinctions. the existence of the virtues without the possession
of knowledge in the higher or philosophical sense is admitted to be
possible. right opinion is again introduced in the theaetetus as
an account of knowledge, but is rejected on the ground that it is
irrational (as here, because it is not bound by the tie of the cause),
and also because the conception of false opinion is given up as
hopeless. the doctrines of plato are necessarily different at different
times of his life, as new distinctions are realized, or new stages of
thought attained by him. we are not therefore justified, in order to
take away the appearance of inconsistency, in attributing to him hidden
meanings or remote allusions.

there are no external criteria by which we can determine the date of the
meno. there is no reason to suppose that any of the dialogues of plato
were written before the death of socrates; the meno, which appears to be
one of the earliest of them, is proved to have been of a later date by
the allusion of anytus.

we cannot argue that plato was more likely to have written, as he has
done, of meno before than after his miserable death; for we have already
seen, in the examples of charmides and critias, that the characters in
plato are very far from resembling the same characters in history. the
repulsive picture which is given of him in the anabasis of xenophon,
where he also appears as the friend of aristippus 'and a fair youth
having lovers,' has no other trait of likeness to the meno of plato.

the place of the meno in the series is doubtfully indicated by internal
evidence. the main character of the dialogue is socrates; but to the
'general definitions' of socrates is added the platonic doctrine of
reminiscence. the problems of virtue and knowledge have been discussed
in the lysis, laches, charmides, and protagoras; the puzzle about
knowing and learning has already appeared in the euthydemus. the
doctrines of immortality and pre-existence are carried further in the
phaedrus and phaedo; the distinction between opinion and knowledge is
more fully developed in the theaetetus. the lessons of prodicus, whom he
facetiously calls his master, are still running in the mind of socrates.
unlike the later platonic dialogues, the meno arrives at no conclusion.
hence we are led to place the dialogue at some point of time later than
the protagoras, and earlier than the phaedrus and gorgias. the place
which is assigned to it in this work is due mainly to the desire to
bring together in a single volume all the dialogues which contain
allusions to the trial and death of socrates.

on the ideas of plato.

plato's doctrine of ideas has attained an imaginary clearness and
definiteness which is not to be found in his own writings. the popular
account of them is partly derived from one or two passages in his
dialogues interpreted without regard to their poetical environment. it
is due also to the misunderstanding of him by the aristotelian school;
and the erroneous notion has been further narrowed and has become fixed
by the realism of the schoolmen. this popular view of the platonic ideas
may be summed up in some such formula as the following: 'truth consists
not in particulars, but in universals, which have a place in the mind of
god, or in some far-off heaven. these were revealed to men in a former
state of existence, and are recovered by reminiscence (anamnesis) or
association from sensible things. the sensible things are not
realities, but shadows only, in relation to the truth.' these unmeaning
propositions are hardly suspected to be a caricature of a great theory
of knowledge, which plato in various ways and under many figures of
speech is seeking to unfold. poetry has been converted into dogma; and
it is not remarked that the platonic ideas are to be found only in about
a third of plato's writings and are not confined to him. the forms which
they assume are numerous, and if taken literally, inconsistent with one
another. at one time we are in the clouds of mythology, at another among
the abstractions of mathematics or metaphysics; we pass imperceptibly
from one to the other. reason and fancy are mingled in the same
passage. the ideas are sometimes described as many, coextensive with
the universals of sense and also with the first principles of ethics; or
again they are absorbed into the single idea of good, and subordinated
to it. they are not more certain than facts, but they are equally
certain (phaedo). they are both personal and impersonal. they are
abstract terms: they are also the causes of things; and they are even
transformed into the demons or spirits by whose help god made the world.
and the idea of good (republic) may without violence be converted into
the supreme being, who 'because he was good' created all things (tim.).

it would be a mistake to try and reconcile these differing modes of
thought. they are not to be regarded seriously as having a distinct
meaning. they are parables, prophecies, myths, symbols, revelations,
aspirations after an unknown world. they derive their origin from a deep
religious and contemplative feeling, and also from an observation of
curious mental phenomena. they gather up the elements of the previous
philosophies, which they put together in a new form. their great
diversity shows the tentative character of early endeavours to think.
they have not yet settled down into a single system. plato uses them,
though he also criticises them; he acknowledges that both he and others
are always talking about them, especially about the idea of good; and
that they are not peculiar to himself (phaedo; republic; soph.). but in
his later writings he seems to have laid aside the old forms of them.
as he proceeds he makes for himself new modes of expression more akin to
the aristotelian logic.

yet amid all these varieties and incongruities, there is a common
meaning or spirit which pervades his writings, both those in which he
treats of the ideas and those in which he is silent about them. this is
the spirit of idealism, which in the history of philosophy has had many
names and taken many forms, and has in a measure influenced those
who seemed to be most averse to it. it has often been charged with
inconsistency and fancifulness, and yet has had an elevating effect on
human nature, and has exercised a wonderful charm and interest over
a few spirits who have been lost in the thought of it. it has been
banished again and again, but has always returned. it has attempted to
leave the earth and soar heavenwards, but soon has found that only
in experience could any solid foundation of knowledge be laid. it has
degenerated into pantheism, but has again emerged. no other knowledge
has given an equal stimulus to the mind. it is the science of sciences,
which are also ideas, and under either aspect require to be defined.
they can only be thought of in due proportion when conceived in relation
to one another. they are the glasses through which the kingdoms of
science are seen, but at a distance. all the greatest minds, except when
living in an age of reaction against them, have unconsciously fallen
under their power.

the account of the platonic ideas in the meno is the simplest and
clearest, and we shall best illustrate their nature by giving this first
and then comparing the manner in which they are described elsewhere,
e.g. in the phaedrus, phaedo, republic; to which may be added the
criticism of them in the parmenides, the personal form which is
attributed to them in the timaeus, the logical character which they
assume in the sophist and philebus, and the allusion to them in the
laws. in the cratylus they dawn upon him with the freshness of a
newly-discovered thought.

the meno goes back to a former state of existence, in which men did and
suffered good and evil, and received the reward or punishment of them
until their sin was purged away and they were allowed to return to
earth. this is a tradition of the olden time, to which priests and poets
bear witness. the souls of men returning to earth bring back a latent
memory of ideas, which were known to them in a former state. the
recollection is awakened into life and consciousness by the sight of the
things which resemble them on earth. the soul evidently possesses such
innate ideas before she has had time to acquire them. this is proved by
an experiment tried on one of meno's slaves, from whom socrates elicits
truths of arithmetic and geometry, which he had never learned in this
world. he must therefore have brought them with him from another.

the notion of a previous state of existence is found in the verses
of empedocles and in the fragments of heracleitus. it was the natural
answer to two questions, 'whence came the soul? what is the origin of
evil?' and prevailed far and wide in the east. it found its way into
hellas probably through the medium of orphic and pythagorean rites and
mysteries. it was easier to think of a former than of a future life,
because such a life has really existed for the race though not for the
individual, and all men come into the world, if not 'trailing clouds of
glory,' at any rate able to enter into the inheritance of the past. in
the phaedrus, as well as in the meno, it is this former rather than a
future life on which plato is disposed to dwell. there the gods, and men
following in their train, go forth to contemplate the heavens, and are
borne round in the revolutions of them. there they see the divine forms
of justice, temperance, and the like, in their unchangeable beauty, but
not without an effort more than human. the soul of man is likened to
a charioteer and two steeds, one mortal, the other immortal. the
charioteer and the mortal steed are in fierce conflict; at length the
animal principle is finally overpowered, though not extinguished, by the
combined energies of the passionate and rational elements. this is one
of those passages in plato which, partaking both of a philosophical
and poetical character, is necessarily indistinct and inconsistent. the
magnificent figure under which the nature of the soul is described has
not much to do with the popular doctrine of the ideas. yet there is one
little trait in the description which shows that they are present to
plato's mind, namely, the remark that the soul, which had seen truths
in the form of the universal, cannot again return to the nature of an
animal.

in the phaedo, as in the meno, the origin of ideas is sought for in a
previous state of existence. there was no time when they could have been
acquired in this life, and therefore they must have been recovered from
another. the process of recovery is no other than the ordinary law of
association, by which in daily life the sight of one thing or person
recalls another to our minds, and by which in scientific enquiry from
any part of knowledge we may be led on to infer the whole. it is also
argued that ideas, or rather ideals, must be derived from a previous
state of existence because they are more perfect than the sensible forms
of them which are given by experience. but in the phaedo the doctrine
of ideas is subordinate to the proof of the immortality of the soul.
'if the soul existed in a previous state, then it will exist in a future
state, for a law of alternation pervades all things.' and, 'if the ideas
exist, then the soul exists; if not, not.' it is to be observed, both
in the meno and the phaedo, that socrates expresses himself with
diffidence. he speaks in the phaedo of the words with which he has
comforted himself and his friends, and will not be too confident that
the description which he has given of the soul and her mansions is
exactly true, but he 'ventures to think that something of the kind is
true.' and in the meno, after dwelling upon the immortality of the
soul, he adds, 'of some things which i have said i am not altogether
confident' (compare apology; gorgias). from this class of uncertainties
he exempts the difference between truth and appearance, of which he is
absolutely convinced.

in the republic the ideas are spoken of in two ways, which though not
contradictory are different. in the tenth book they are represented as
the genera or general ideas under which individuals having a common name
are contained. for example, there is the bed which the carpenter makes,
the picture of the bed which is drawn by the painter, the bed existing
in nature of which god is the author. of the latter all visible beds
are only the shadows or reflections. this and similar illustrations or
explanations are put forth, not for their own sake, or as an exposition
of plato's theory of ideas, but with a view of showing that poetry and
the mimetic arts are concerned with an inferior part of the soul and a
lower kind of knowledge. on the other hand, in the 6th and 7th books
of the republic we reach the highest and most perfect conception, which
plato is able to attain, of the nature of knowledge. the ideas are now
finally seen to be one as well as many, causes as well as ideas, and to
have a unity which is the idea of good and the cause of all the rest.
they seem, however, to have lost their first aspect of universals under
which individuals are contained, and to have been converted into forms
of another kind, which are inconsistently regarded from the one side as
images or ideals of justice, temperance, holiness and the like; from the
other as hypotheses, or mathematical truths or principles.

in the timaeus, which in the series of plato's works immediately follows
the republic, though probably written some time afterwards, no mention
occurs of the doctrine of ideas. geometrical forms and arithmetical
ratios furnish the laws according to which the world is created. but
though the conception of the ideas as genera or species is forgotten or
laid aside, the distinction of the visible and intellectual is as
firmly maintained as ever. the idea of good likewise disappears and is
superseded by the conception of a personal god, who works according to
a final cause or principle of goodness which he himself is. no doubt is
expressed by plato, either in the timaeus or in any other dialogue, of
the truths which he conceives to be the first and highest. it is not the
existence of god or the idea of good which he approaches in a tentative
or hesitating manner, but the investigations of physiology. these he
regards, not seriously, as a part of philosophy, but as an innocent
recreation (tim.).

passing on to the parmenides, we find in that dialogue not an exposition
or defence of the doctrine of ideas, but an assault upon them, which is
put into the mouth of the veteran parmenides, and might be ascribed to
aristotle himself, or to one of his disciples. the doctrine which is
assailed takes two or three forms, but fails in any of them to escape
the dialectical difficulties which are urged against it. it is admitted
that there are ideas of all things, but the manner in which individuals
partake of them, whether of the whole or of the part, and in which
they become like them, or how ideas can be either within or without
the sphere of human knowledge, or how the human and divine can have any
relation to each other, is held to be incapable of explanation. and
yet, if there are no universal ideas, what becomes of philosophy?
(parmenides.) in the sophist the theory of ideas is spoken of as a
doctrine held not by plato, but by another sect of philosophers, called
'the friends of ideas,' probably the megarians, who were very distinct
from him, if not opposed to him (sophist). nor in what may be termed
plato's abridgement of the history of philosophy (soph.), is any mention
made such as we find in the first book of aristotle's metaphysics,
of the derivation of such a theory or of any part of it from the
pythagoreans, the eleatics, the heracleiteans, or even from socrates. in
the philebus, probably one of the latest of the platonic dialogues,
the conception of a personal or semi-personal deity expressed under the
figure of mind, the king of all, who is also the cause, is retained. the
one and many of the phaedrus and theaetetus is still working in the mind
of plato, and the correlation of ideas, not of 'all with all,' but of
'some with some,' is asserted and explained. but they are spoken of in
a different manner, and are not supposed to be recovered from a former
state of existence. the metaphysical conception of truth passes into a
psychological one, which is continued in the laws, and is the final
form of the platonic philosophy, so far as can be gathered from his own
writings (see especially laws). in the laws he harps once more on the
old string, and returns to general notions:--these he acknowledges to
be many, and yet he insists that they are also one. the guardian must be
made to recognize the truth, for which he has contended long ago in the
protagoras, that the virtues are four, but they are also in some sense
one (laws; compare protagoras).

so various, and if regarded on the surface only, inconsistent, are the
statements of plato respecting the doctrine of ideas. if we attempted to
harmonize or to combine them, we should make out of them, not a system,
but the caricature of a system. they are the ever-varying expression
of plato's idealism. the terms used in them are in their substance and
general meaning the same, although they seem to be different. they
pass from the subject to the object, from earth (diesseits) to
heaven (jenseits) without regard to the gulf which later theology and
philosophy have made between them. they are also intended to supplement
or explain each other. they relate to a subject of which plato himself
would have said that 'he was not confident of the precise form of his
own statements, but was strong in the belief that something of the kind
was true.' it is the spirit, not the letter, in which they agree--the
spirit which places the divine above the human, the spiritual above the
material, the one above the many, the mind before the body.

the stream of ancient philosophy in the alexandrian and roman times
widens into a lake or sea, and then disappears underground to reappear
after many ages in a distant land. it begins to flow again under new
conditions, at first confined between high and narrow banks, but finally
spreading over the continent of europe. it is and is not the same with
ancient philosophy. there is a great deal in modern philosophy which is
inspired by ancient. there is much in ancient philosophy which was 'born
out of due time; and before men were capable of understanding it. to the
fathers of modern philosophy, their own thoughts appeared to be new
and original, but they carried with them an echo or shadow of the past,
coming back by recollection from an elder world. of this the enquirers
of the seventeenth century, who to themselves appeared to be working out
independently the enquiry into all truth, were unconscious. they stood
in a new relation to theology and natural philosophy, and for a time
maintained towards both an attitude of reserve and separation. yet the
similarities between modern and ancient thought are greater far than the
differences. all philosophy, even that part of it which is said to be
based upon experience, is really ideal; and ideas are not only derived
from facts, but they are also prior to them and extend far beyond them,
just as the mind is prior to the senses.

early greek speculation culminates in the ideas of plato, or rather in
the single idea of good. his followers, and perhaps he himself, having
arrived at this elevation, instead of going forwards went backwards from
philosophy to psychology, from ideas to numbers. but what we perceive to
be the real meaning of them, an explanation of the nature and origin
of knowledge, will always continue to be one of the first problems of
philosophy.

plato also left behind him a most potent instrument, the forms of
logic--arms ready for use, but not yet taken out of their armoury. they
were the late birth of the early greek philosophy, and were the only
part of it which has had an uninterrupted hold on the mind of europe.
philosophies come and go; but the detection of fallacies, the framing
of definitions, the invention of methods still continue to be the main
elements of the reasoning process.

modern philosophy, like ancient, begins with very simple conceptions.
it is almost wholly a reflection on self. it might be described as
a quickening into life of old words and notions latent in the
semi-barbarous latin, and putting a new meaning into them. unlike
ancient philosophy, it has been unaffected by impressions derived from
outward nature: it arose within the limits of the mind itself. from the
time of descartes to hume and kant it has had little or nothing to do
with facts of science. on the other hand, the ancient and mediaeval
logic retained a continuous influence over it, and a form like that
of mathematics was easily impressed upon it; the principle of ancient
philosophy which is most apparent in it is scepticism; we must doubt
nearly every traditional or received notion, that we may hold fast one
or two. the being of god in a personal or impersonal form was a mental
necessity to the first thinkers of modern times: from this alone all
other ideas could be deduced. there had been an obscure presentiment of
'cognito, ergo sum' more than 2000 years previously. the eleatic notion
that being and thought were the same was revived in a new form by
descartes. but now it gave birth to consciousness and self-reflection:
it awakened the 'ego' in human nature. the mind naked and abstract has
no other certainty but the conviction of its own existence. 'i think,
therefore i am;' and this thought is god thinking in me, who has also
communicated to the reason of man his own attributes of thought and
extension--these are truly imparted to him because god is true (compare
republic). it has been often remarked that descartes, having begun by
dismissing all presuppositions, introduces several: he passes almost
at once from scepticism to dogmatism. it is more important for the
illustration of plato to observe that he, like plato, insists that god
is true and incapable of deception (republic)--that he proceeds from
general ideas, that many elements of mathematics may be found in him. a
certain influence of mathematics both on the form and substance of their
philosophy is discernible in both of them. after making the greatest
opposition between thought and extension, descartes, like plato,
supposes them to be reunited for a time, not in their own nature but by
a special divine act (compare phaedrus), and he also supposes all
the parts of the human body to meet in the pineal gland, that alone
affording a principle of unity in the material frame of man. it is
characteristic of the first period of modern philosophy, that having
begun (like the presocratics) with a few general notions, descartes
first falls absolutely under their influence, and then quickly discards
them. at the same time he is less able to observe facts, because they
are too much magnified by the glasses through which they are seen.
the common logic says 'the greater the extension, the less the
comprehension,' and we may put the same thought in another way and say
of abstract or general ideas, that the greater the abstraction of them,
the less are they capable of being applied to particular and concrete
natures.

not very different from descartes in his relation to ancient philosophy
is his successor spinoza, who lived in the following generation. the
system of spinoza is less personal and also less dualistic than that
of descartes. in this respect the difference between them is like that
between xenophanes and parmenides. the teaching of spinoza might be
described generally as the jewish religion reduced to an abstraction
and taking the form of the eleatic philosophy. like parmenides, he is
overpowered and intoxicated with the idea of being or god. the greatness
of both philosophies consists in the immensity of a thought which
excludes all other thoughts; their weakness is the necessary separation
of this thought from actual existence and from practical life. in
neither of them is there any clear opposition between the inward and
outward world. the substance of spinoza has two attributes, which alone
are cognizable by man, thought and extension; these are in extreme
opposition to one another, and also in inseparable identity. they may be
regarded as the two aspects or expressions under which god or substance
is unfolded to man. here a step is made beyond the limits of the eleatic
philosophy. the famous theorem of spinoza, 'omnis determinatio est
negatio,' is already contained in the 'negation is relation' of plato's
sophist. the grand description of the philosopher in republic vi, as the
spectator of all time and all existence, may be paralleled with
another famous expression of spinoza, 'contemplatio rerum sub specie
eternitatis.' according to spinoza finite objects are unreal, for they
are conditioned by what is alien to them, and by one another. human
beings are included in the number of them. hence there is no reality
in human action and no place for right and wrong. individuality is
accident. the boasted freedom of the will is only a consciousness of
necessity. truth, he says, is the direction of the reason towards the
infinite, in which all things repose; and herein lies the secret of
man's well-being. in the exaltation of the reason or intellect, in the
denial of the voluntariness of evil (timaeus; laws) spinoza approaches
nearer to plato than in his conception of an infinite substance. as
socrates said that virtue is knowledge, so spinoza would have maintained
that knowledge alone is good, and what contributes to knowledge useful.
both are equally far from any real experience or observation of nature.
and the same difficulty is found in both when we seek to apply their
ideas to life and practice. there is a gulf fixed between the infinite
substance and finite objects or individuals of spinoza, just as there is
between the ideas of plato and the world of sense.

removed from spinoza by less than a generation is the philosopher
leibnitz, who after deepening and intensifying the opposition between
mind and matter, reunites them by his preconcerted harmony (compare
again phaedrus). to him all the particles of matter are living beings
which reflect on one another, and in the least of them the whole is
contained. here we catch a reminiscence both of the omoiomere, or
similar particles of anaxagoras, and of the world-animal of the timaeus.

in bacon and locke we have another development in which the mind of
man is supposed to receive knowledge by a new method and to work by
observation and experience. but we may remark that it is the idea
of experience, rather than experience itself, with which the mind is
filled. it is a symbol of knowledge rather than the reality which is
vouchsafed to us. the organon of bacon is not much nearer to actual
facts than the organon of aristotle or the platonic idea of good. many
of the old rags and ribbons which defaced the garment of philosophy have
been stripped off, but some of them still adhere. a crude conception of
the ideas of plato survives in the 'forms' of bacon. and on the other
hand, there are many passages of plato in which the importance of the
investigation of facts is as much insisted upon as by bacon. both are
almost equally superior to the illusions of language, and are constantly
crying out against them, as against other idols.

locke cannot be truly regarded as the author of sensationalism any more
than of idealism. his system is based upon experience, but with him
experience includes reflection as well as sense. his analysis and
construction of ideas has no foundation in fact; it is only the
dialectic of the mind 'talking to herself.' the philosophy of berkeley
is but the transposition of two words. for objects of sense he would
substitute sensations. he imagines himself to have changed the relation
of the human mind towards god and nature; they remain the same as
before, though he has drawn the imaginary line by which they are divided
at a different point. he has annihilated the outward world, but it
instantly reappears governed by the same laws and described under the
same names.

a like remark applies to david hume, of whose philosophy the central
principle is the denial of the relation of cause and effect. he would
deprive men of a familiar term which they can ill afford to lose; but
he seems not to have observed that this alteration is merely verbal and
does not in any degree affect the nature of things. still less did he
remark that he was arguing from the necessary imperfection of language
against the most certain facts. and here, again, we may find a parallel
with the ancients. he goes beyond facts in his scepticism, as they did
in their idealism. like the ancient sophists, he relegates the more
important principles of ethics to custom and probability. but crude and
unmeaning as this philosophy is, it exercised a great influence on his
successors, not unlike that which locke exercised upon berkeley and
berkeley upon hume himself. all three were both sceptical and ideal in
almost equal degrees. neither they nor their predecessors had any true
conception of language or of the history of philosophy. hume's
paradox has been forgotten by the world, and did not any more than the
scepticism of the ancients require to be seriously refuted. like some
other philosophical paradoxes, it would have been better left to die
out. it certainly could not be refuted by a philosophy such as kant's,
in which, no less than in the previously mentioned systems, the history
of the human mind and the nature of language are almost wholly ignored,
and the certainty of objective knowledge is transferred to the subject;
while absolute truth is reduced to a figment, more abstract and narrow
than plato's ideas, of 'thing in itself,' to which, if we reason
strictly, no predicate can be applied.

the question which plato has raised respecting the origin and nature of
ideas belongs to the infancy of philosophy; in modern times it would no
longer be asked. their origin is only their history, so far as we know
it; there can be no other. we may trace them in language, in philosophy,
in mythology, in poetry, but we cannot argue a priori about them. we may
attempt to shake them off, but they are always returning, and in every
sphere of science and human action are tending to go beyond facts. they
are thought to be innate, because they have been familiar to us all our
lives, and we can no longer dismiss them from our mind. many of them
express relations of terms to which nothing exactly or nothing at all in
rerum natura corresponds. we are not such free agents in the use of
them as we sometimes imagine. fixed ideas have taken the most complete
possession of some thinkers who have been most determined to renounce
them, and have been vehemently affirmed when they could be least
explained and were incapable of proof. the world has often been led away
by a word to which no distinct meaning could be attached. abstractions
such as 'authority,' 'equality,' 'utility,' 'liberty,' 'pleasure,'
'experience,' 'consciousness,' 'chance,' 'substance,' 'matter,' 'atom,'
and a heap of other metaphysical and theological terms, are the source
of quite as much error and illusion and have as little relation
to actual facts as the ideas of plato. few students of theology or
philosophy have sufficiently reflected how quickly the bloom of a
philosophy passes away; or how hard it is for one age to understand the
writings of another; or how nice a judgment is required of those who are
seeking to express the philosophy of one age in the terms of another.
the 'eternal truths' of which metaphysicians speak have hardly ever
lasted more than a generation. in our own day schools or systems of
philosophy which have once been famous have died before the founders of
them. we are still, as in plato's age, groping about for a new method
more comprehensive than any of those which now prevail; and also more
permanent. and we seem to see at a distance the promise of such a
method, which can hardly be any other than the method of idealized
experience, having roots which strike far down into the history of
philosophy. it is a method which does not divorce the present from the
past, or the part from the whole, or the abstract from the concrete,
or theory from fact, or the divine from the human, or one science
from another, but labours to connect them. along such a road we have
proceeded a few steps, sufficient, perhaps, to make us reflect on the
want of method which prevails in our own day. in another age, all the
branches of knowledge, whether relating to god or man or nature, will
become the knowledge of 'the revelation of a single science' (symp.),
and all things, like the stars in heaven, will shed their light upon one
another.




meno


persons of the dialogue: meno, socrates, a slave of meno (boy), anytus.


meno: can you tell me, socrates, whether virtue is acquired by teaching
or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor by practice, then whether
it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?

socrates: o meno, there was a time when the thessalians were famous
among the other hellenes only for their riches and their riding; but
now, if i am not mistaken, they are equally famous for their wisdom,
especially at larisa, which is the native city of your friend
aristippus. and this is gorgias' doing; for when he came there, the
flower of the aleuadae, among them your admirer aristippus, and the
other chiefs of the thessalians, fell in love with his wisdom. and he
has taught you the habit of answering questions in a grand and bold
style, which becomes those who know, and is the style in which he
himself answers all comers; and any hellene who likes may ask him
anything. how different is our lot! my dear meno. here at athens there
is a dearth of the commodity, and all wisdom seems to have emigrated
from us to you. i am certain that if you were to ask any athenian
whether virtue was natural or acquired, he would laugh in your face,
and say: 'stranger, you have far too good an opinion of me, if you think
that i can answer your question. for i literally do not know what virtue
is, and much less whether it is acquired by teaching or not.' and i
myself, meno, living as i do in this region of poverty, am as poor as
the rest of the world; and i confess with shame that i know literally
nothing about virtue; and when i do not know the 'quid' of anything how
can i know the 'quale'? how, if i knew nothing at all of meno, could
i tell if he was fair, or the opposite of fair; rich and noble, or the
reverse of rich and noble? do you think that i could?

meno: no, indeed. but are you in earnest, socrates, in saying that you
do not know what virtue is? and am i to carry back this report of you to
thessaly?

socrates: not only that, my dear boy, but you may say further that i
have never known of any one else who did, in my judgment.

meno: then you have never met gorgias when he was at athens?

socrates: yes, i have.

meno: and did you not think that he knew?

socrates: i have not a good memory, meno, and therefore i cannot now
tell what i thought of him at the time. and i dare say that he did know,
and that you know what he said: please, therefore, to remind me of what
he said; or, if you would rather, tell me your own view; for i suspect
that you and he think much alike.

meno: very true.

socrates: then as he is not here, never mind him, and do you tell me:
by the gods, meno, be generous, and tell me what you say that virtue is;
for i shall be truly delighted to find that i have been mistaken, and
that you and gorgias do really have this knowledge; although i have been
just saying that i have never found anybody who had.

meno: there will be no difficulty, socrates, in answering your question.
let us take first the virtue of a man--he should know how to administer
the state, and in the administration of it to benefit his friends
and harm his enemies; and he must also be careful not to suffer harm
himself. a woman's virtue, if you wish to know about that, may also
be easily described: her duty is to order her house, and keep what is
indoors, and obey her husband. every age, every condition of life, young
or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are
virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is
relative to the actions and ages of each of us in all that we do. and
the same may be said of vice, socrates (compare arist. pol.).

socrates: how fortunate i am, meno! when i ask you for one virtue, you
present me with a swarm of them (compare theaet.), which are in your
keeping. suppose that i carry on the figure of the swarm, and ask of
you, what is the nature of the bee? and you answer that there are many
kinds of bees, and i reply: but do bees differ as bees, because there
are many and different kinds of them; or are they not rather to be
distinguished by some other quality, as for example beauty, size, or
shape? how would you answer me?

meno: i should answer that bees do not differ from one another, as bees.

socrates: and if i went on to say: that is what i desire to know, meno;
tell me what is the quality in which they do not differ, but are all
alike;--would you be able to answer?

meno: i should.

socrates: and so of the virtues, however many and different they may be,
they have all a common nature which makes them virtues; and on this he
who would answer the question, 'what is virtue?' would do well to have
his eye fixed: do you understand?

meno: i am beginning to understand; but i do not as yet take hold of the
question as i could wish.

socrates: when you say, meno, that there is one virtue of a man, another
of a woman, another of a child, and so on, does this apply only to
virtue, or would you say the same of health, and size, and strength? or
is the nature of health always the same, whether in man or woman?

meno: i should say that health is the same, both in man and woman.

socrates: and is not this true of size and strength? if a woman is
strong, she will be strong by reason of the same form and of the same
strength subsisting in her which there is in the man. i mean to say that
strength, as strength, whether of man or woman, is the same. is there
any difference?

meno: i think not.

socrates: and will not virtue, as virtue, be the same, whether in a
child or in a grown-up person, in a woman or in a man?

meno: i cannot help feeling, socrates, that this case is different from
the others.

socrates: but why? were you not saying that the virtue of a man was to
order a state, and the virtue of a woman was to order a house?

meno: i did say so.

socrates: and can either house or state or anything be well ordered
without temperance and without justice?

meno: certainly not.

socrates: then they who order a state or a house temperately or justly
order them with temperance and justice?

meno: certainly.

socrates: then both men and women, if they are to be good men and women,
must have the same virtues of temperance and justice?

meno: true.

socrates: and can either a young man or an elder one be good, if they
are intemperate and unjust?

meno: they cannot.

socrates: they must be temperate and just?

meno: yes.

socrates: then all men are good in the same way, and by participation in
the same virtues?

meno: such is the inference.

socrates: and they surely would not have been good in the same way,
unless their virtue had been the same?

meno: they would not.

socrates: then now that the sameness of all virtue has been proven, try
and remember what you and gorgias say that virtue is.

meno: will you have one definition of them all?

socrates: that is what i am seeking.

meno: if you want to have one definition of them all, i know not what to
say, but that virtue is the power of governing mankind.

socrates: and does this definition of virtue include all virtue? is
virtue the same in a child and in a slave, meno? can the child govern
his father, or the slave his master; and would he who governed be any
longer a slave?

meno: i think not, socrates.

socrates: no, indeed; there would be small reason in that. yet once
more, fair friend; according to you, virtue is 'the power of governing;'
but do you not add 'justly and not unjustly'?

meno: yes, socrates; i agree there; for justice is virtue.

socrates: would you say 'virtue,' meno, or 'a virtue'?

meno: what do you mean?

socrates: i mean as i might say about anything; that a round, for
example, is 'a figure' and not simply 'figure,' and i should adopt this
mode of speaking, because there are other figures.

meno: quite right; and that is just what i am saying about virtue--that
there are other virtues as well as justice.

socrates: what are they? tell me the names of them, as i would tell you
the names of the other figures if you asked me.

meno: courage and temperance and wisdom and magnanimity are virtues; and
there are many others.

socrates: yes, meno; and again we are in the same case: in searching
after one virtue we have found many, though not in the same way as
before; but we have been unable to find the common virtue which runs
through them all.

meno: why, socrates, even now i am not able to follow you in the attempt
to get at one common notion of virtue as of other things.

socrates: no wonder; but i will try to get nearer if i can, for you know
that all things have a common notion. suppose now that some one asked
you the question which i asked before: meno, he would say, what is
figure? and if you answered 'roundness,' he would reply to you, in
my way of speaking, by asking whether you would say that roundness is
'figure' or 'a figure;' and you would answer 'a figure.'

meno: certainly.

socrates: and for this reason--that there are other figures?

meno: yes.

socrates: and if he proceeded to ask, what other figures are there? you
would have told him.

meno: i should.

socrates: and if he similarly asked what colour is, and you answered
whiteness, and the questioner rejoined, would you say that whiteness is
colour or a colour? you would reply, a colour, because there are other
colours as well.

meno: i should.

socrates: and if he had said, tell me what they are?--you would have
told him of other colours which are colours just as much as whiteness.

meno: yes.

socrates: and suppose that he were to pursue the matter in my way, he
would say: ever and anon we are landed in particulars, but this is not
what i want; tell me then, since you call them by a common name, and
say that they are all figures, even when opposed to one another, what
is that common nature which you designate as figure--which contains
straight as well as round, and is no more one than the other--that would
be your mode of speaking?

meno: yes.

socrates: and in speaking thus, you do not mean to say that the round
is round any more than straight, or the straight any more straight than
round?

meno: certainly not.

socrates: you only assert that the round figure is not more a figure
than the straight, or the straight than the round?

meno: very true.

socrates: to what then do we give the name of figure? try and answer.
suppose that when a person asked you this question either about figure
or colour, you were to reply, man, i do not understand what you want,
or know what you are saying; he would look rather astonished and say:
do you not understand that i am looking for the 'simile in multis'? and
then he might put the question in another form: meno, he might say, what
is that 'simile in multis' which you call figure, and which includes
not only round and straight figures, but all? could you not answer that
question, meno? i wish that you would try; the attempt will be good
practice with a view to the answer about virtue.

meno: i would rather that you should answer, socrates.

socrates: shall i indulge you?

meno: by all means.

socrates: and then you will tell me about virtue?

meno: i will.

socrates: then i must do my best, for there is a prize to be won.

meno: certainly.

socrates: well, i will try and explain to you what figure is. what do
you say to this answer?--figure is the only thing which always follows
colour. will you be satisfied with it, as i am sure that i should be, if
you would let me have a similar definition of virtue?

meno: but, socrates, it is such a simple answer.

socrates: why simple?

meno: because, according to you, figure is that which always follows
colour.

(socrates: granted.)

meno: but if a person were to say that he does not know what colour is,
any more than what figure is--what sort of answer would you have given
him?

socrates: i should have told him the truth. and if he were a philosopher
of the eristic and antagonistic sort, i should say to him: you have my
answer, and if i am wrong, your business is to take up the argument and
refute me. but if we were friends, and were talking as you and i are
now, i should reply in a milder strain and more in the dialectician's
vein; that is to say, i should not only speak the truth, but i should
make use of premises which the person interrogated would be willing to
admit. and this is the way in which i shall endeavour to approach you.
you will acknowledge, will you not, that there is such a thing as an
end, or termination, or extremity?--all which words i use in the same
sense, although i am aware that prodicus might draw distinctions about
them: but still you, i am sure, would speak of a thing as ended or
terminated--that is all which i am saying--not anything very difficult.

meno: yes, i should; and i believe that i understand your meaning.

socrates: and you would speak of a surface and also of a solid, as for
example in geometry.

meno: yes.

socrates: well then, you are now in a condition to understand my
definition of figure. i define figure to be that in which the solid
ends; or, more concisely, the limit of solid.

meno: and now, socrates, what is colour?

socrates: you are outrageous, meno, in thus plaguing a poor old man to
give you an answer, when you will not take the trouble of remembering
what is gorgias' definition of virtue.

meno: when you have told me what i ask, i will tell you, socrates.

socrates: a man who was blindfolded has only to hear you talking, and he
would know that you are a fair creature and have still many lovers.

meno: why do you think so?

socrates: why, because you always speak in imperatives: like all
beauties when they are in their prime, you are tyrannical; and also,
as i suspect, you have found out that i have weakness for the fair, and
therefore to humour you i must answer.

meno: please do.

socrates: would you like me to answer you after the manner of gorgias,
which is familiar to you?

meno: i should like nothing better.

socrates: do not he and you and empedocles say that there are certain
effluences of existence?

meno: certainly.

socrates: and passages into which and through which the effluences pass?

meno: exactly.

socrates: and some of the effluences fit into the passages, and some of
them are too small or too large?

meno: true.

socrates: and there is such a thing as sight?

meno: yes.

socrates: and now, as pindar says, 'read my meaning:'--colour is an
effluence of form, commensurate with sight, and palpable to sense.

meno: that, socrates, appears to me to be an admirable answer.

socrates: why, yes, because it happens to be one which you have been in
the habit of hearing: and your wit will have discovered, i suspect, that
you may explain in the same way the nature of sound and smell, and of
many other similar phenomena.

meno: quite true.

socrates: the answer, meno, was in the orthodox solemn vein, and
therefore was more acceptable to you than the other answer about figure.

meno: yes.

socrates: and yet, o son of alexidemus, i cannot help thinking that
the other was the better; and i am sure that you would be of the
same opinion, if you would only stay and be initiated, and were not
compelled, as you said yesterday, to go away before the mysteries.

meno: but i will stay, socrates, if you will give me many such answers.

socrates: well then, for my own sake as well as for yours, i will do
my very best; but i am afraid that i shall not be able to give you very
many as good: and now, in your turn, you are to fulfil your promise, and
tell me what virtue is in the universal; and do not make a singular into
a plural, as the facetious say of those who break a thing, but deliver
virtue to me whole and sound, and not broken into a number of pieces: i
have given you the pattern.

meno: well then, socrates, virtue, as i take it, is when he, who desires
the honourable, is able to provide it for himself; so the poet says, and
i say too--

'virtue is the desire of things honourable and the power of attaining
them.'

socrates: and does he who desires the honourable also desire the good?

meno: certainly.

socrates: then are there some who desire the evil and others who desire
the good? do not all men, my dear sir, desire good?

meno: i think not.

socrates: there are some who desire evil?

meno: yes.

socrates: do you mean that they think the evils which they desire, to be
good; or do they know that they are evil and yet desire them?

meno: both, i think.

socrates: and do you really imagine, meno, that a man knows evils to be
evils and desires them notwithstanding?

meno: certainly i do.

socrates: and desire is of possession?

meno: yes, of possession.

socrates: and does he think that the evils will do good to him who
possesses them, or does he know that they will do him harm?

meno: there are some who think that the evils will do them good, and
others who know that they will do them harm.

socrates: and, in your opinion, do those who think that they will do
them good know that they are evils?

meno: certainly not.

socrates: is it not obvious that those who are ignorant of their nature
do not desire them; but they desire what they suppose to be goods
although they are really evils; and if they are mistaken and suppose the
evils to be goods they really desire goods?

meno: yes, in that case.

socrates: well, and do those who, as you say, desire evils, and think
that evils are hurtful to the possessor of them, know that they will be
hurt by them?

meno: they must know it.

socrates: and must they not suppose that those who are hurt are
miserable in proportion to the hurt which is inflicted upon them?

meno: how can it be otherwise?

socrates: but are not the miserable ill-fated?

meno: yes, indeed.

socrates: and does any one desire to be miserable and ill-fated?

meno: i should say not, socrates.

socrates: but if there is no one who desires to be miserable, there is
no one, meno, who desires evil; for what is misery but the desire and
possession of evil?

meno: that appears to be the truth, socrates, and i admit that nobody
desires evil.

socrates: and yet, were you not saying just now that virtue is the
desire and power of attaining good?

meno: yes, i did say so.

socrates: but if this be affirmed, then the desire of good is common to
all, and one man is no better than another in that respect?

meno: true.

socrates: and if one man is not better than another in desiring good, he
must be better in the power of attaining it?

meno: exactly.

socrates: then, according to your definition, virtue would appear to be
the power of attaining good?

meno: i entirely approve, socrates, of the manner in which you now view
this matter.

socrates: then let us see whether what you say is true from another
point of view; for very likely you may be right:--you affirm virtue to
be the power of attaining goods?

meno: yes.

socrates: and the goods which you mean are such as health and wealth and
the possession of gold and silver, and having office and honour in the
state--those are what you would call goods?

meno: yes, i should include all those.

socrates: then, according to meno, who is the hereditary friend of the
great king, virtue is the power of getting silver and gold; and would
you add that they must be gained piously, justly, or do you deem this to
be of no consequence? and is any mode of acquisition, even if unjust and
dishonest, equally to be deemed virtue?

meno: not virtue, socrates, but vice.

socrates: then justice or temperance or holiness, or some other part
of virtue, as would appear, must accompany the acquisition, and without
them the mere acquisition of good will not be virtue.

meno: why, how can there be virtue without these?

socrates: and the non-acquisition of gold and silver in a dishonest
manner for oneself or another, or in other words the want of them, may
be equally virtue?

meno: true.

socrates: then the acquisition of such goods is no more virtue than the
non-acquisition and want of them, but whatever is accompanied by justice
or honesty is virtue, and whatever is devoid of justice is vice.

meno: it cannot be otherwise, in my judgment.

socrates: and were we not saying just now that justice, temperance, and
the like, were each of them a part of virtue?

meno: yes.

socrates: and so, meno, this is the way in which you mock me.

meno: why do you say that, socrates?

socrates: why, because i asked you to deliver virtue into my hands whole
and unbroken, and i gave you a pattern according to which you were to
frame your answer; and you have forgotten already, and tell me that
virtue is the power of attaining good justly, or with justice; and
justice you acknowledge to be a part of virtue.

meno: yes.

socrates: then it follows from your own admissions, that virtue is doing
what you do with a part of virtue; for justice and the like are said by
you to be parts of virtue.

meno: what of that?

socrates: what of that! why, did not i ask you to tell me the nature
of virtue as a whole? and you are very far from telling me this; but
declare every action to be virtue which is done with a part of virtue;
as though you had told me and i must already know the whole of virtue,
and this too when frittered away into little pieces. and, therefore, my
dear meno, i fear that i must begin again and repeat the same question:
what is virtue? for otherwise, i can only say, that every action done
with a part of virtue is virtue; what else is the meaning of saying
that every action done with justice is virtue? ought i not to ask the
question over again; for can any one who does not know virtue know a
part of virtue?

meno: no; i do not say that he can.

socrates: do you remember how, in the example of figure, we rejected any
answer given in terms which were as yet unexplained or unadmitted?

meno: yes, socrates; and we were quite right in doing so.

socrates: but then, my friend, do not suppose that we can explain to any
one the nature of virtue as a whole through some unexplained portion of
virtue, or anything at all in that fashion; we should only have to ask
over again the old question, what is virtue? am i not right?

meno: i believe that you are.

socrates: then begin again, and answer me, what, according to you and
your friend gorgias, is the definition of virtue?

meno: o socrates, i used to be told, before i knew you, that you were
always doubting yourself and making others doubt; and now you are
casting your spells over me, and i am simply getting bewitched and
enchanted, and am at my wits' end. and if i may venture to make a jest
upon you, you seem to me both in your appearance and in your power over
others to be very like the flat torpedo fish, who torpifies those who
come near him and touch him, as you have now torpified me, i think. for
my soul and my tongue are really torpid, and i do not know how to answer
you; and though i have been delivered of an infinite variety of speeches
about virtue before now, and to many persons--and very good ones they
were, as i thought--at this moment i cannot even say what virtue is. and
i think that you are very wise in not voyaging and going away from home,
for if you did in other places as you do in athens, you would be cast
into prison as a magician.

socrates: you are a rogue, meno, and had all but caught me.

meno: what do you mean, socrates?

socrates: i can tell why you made a simile about me.

meno: why?

socrates: in order that i might make another simile about you. for i
know that all pretty young gentlemen like to have pretty similes made
about them--as well they may--but i shall not return the compliment. as
to my being a torpedo, if the torpedo is torpid as well as the cause of
torpidity in others, then indeed i am a torpedo, but not otherwise;
for i perplex others, not because i am clear, but because i am utterly
perplexed myself. and now i know not what virtue is, and you seem to be
in the same case, although you did once perhaps know before you touched
me. however, i have no objection to join with you in the enquiry.

meno: and how will you enquire, socrates, into that which you do not
know? what will you put forth as the subject of enquiry? and if you find
what you want, how will you ever know that this is the thing which you
did not know?

socrates: i know, meno, what you mean; but just see what a tiresome
dispute you are introducing. you argue that a man cannot enquire either
about that which he knows, or about that which he does not know; for if
he knows, he has no need to enquire; and if not, he cannot; for he does
not know the very subject about which he is to enquire (compare aristot.
post. anal.).

meno: well, socrates, and is not the argument sound?

socrates: i think not.

meno: why not?

socrates: i will tell you why: i have heard from certain wise men and
women who spoke of things divine that--

meno: what did they say?

socrates: they spoke of a glorious truth, as i conceive.

meno: what was it? and who were they?

socrates: some of them were priests and priestesses, who had studied how
they might be able to give a reason of their profession: there have been
poets also, who spoke of these things by inspiration, like pindar, and
many others who were inspired. and they say--mark, now, and see whether
their words are true--they say that the soul of man is immortal, and at
one time has an end, which is termed dying, and at another time is born
again, but is never destroyed. and the moral is, that a man ought to
live always in perfect holiness. 'for in the ninth year persephone sends
the souls of those from whom she has received the penalty of ancient
crime back again from beneath into the light of the sun above, and these
are they who become noble kings and mighty men and great in wisdom
and are called saintly heroes in after ages.' the soul, then, as being
immortal, and having been born again many times, and having seen all
things that exist, whether in this world or in the world below, has
knowledge of them all; and it is no wonder that she should be able
to call to remembrance all that she ever knew about virtue, and about
everything; for as all nature is akin, and the soul has learned all
things; there is no difficulty in her eliciting or as men say learning,
out of a single recollection all the rest, if a man is strenuous and
does not faint; for all enquiry and all learning is but recollection.
and therefore we ought not to listen to this sophistical argument about
the impossibility of enquiry: for it will make us idle; and is sweet
only to the sluggard; but the other saying will make us active and
inquisitive. in that confiding, i will gladly enquire with you into the
nature of virtue.

meno: yes, socrates; but what do you mean by saying that we do not
learn, and that what we call learning is only a process of recollection?
can you teach me how this is?

socrates: i told you, meno, just now that you were a rogue, and now you
ask whether i can teach you, when i am saying that there is no teaching,
but only recollection; and thus you imagine that you will involve me in
a contradiction.

meno: indeed, socrates, i protest that i had no such intention. i only
asked the question from habit; but if you can prove to me that what you
say is true, i wish that you would.

socrates: it will be no easy matter, but i will try to please you to
the utmost of my power. suppose that you call one of your numerous
attendants, that i may demonstrate on him.

meno: certainly. come hither, boy.

socrates: he is greek, and speaks greek, does he not?

meno: yes, indeed; he was born in the house.

socrates: attend now to the questions which i ask him, and observe
whether he learns of me or only remembers.

meno: i will.

socrates: tell me, boy, do you know that a figure like this is a square?

boy: i do.

socrates: and you know that a square figure has these four lines equal?

boy: certainly.

socrates: and these lines which i have drawn through the middle of the
square are also equal?

boy: yes.

socrates: a square may be of any size?

boy: certainly.

socrates: and if one side of the figure be of two feet, and the other
side be of two feet, how much will the whole be? let me explain: if in
one direction the space was of two feet, and in the other direction of
one foot, the whole would be of two feet taken once?

boy: yes.

socrates: but since this side is also of two feet, there are twice two
feet?

boy: there are.

socrates: then the square is of twice two feet?

boy: yes.

socrates: and how many are twice two feet? count and tell me.

boy: four, socrates.

socrates: and might there not be another square twice as large as this,
and having like this the lines equal?

boy: yes.

socrates: and of how many feet will that be?

boy: of eight feet.

socrates: and now try and tell me the length of the line which forms the
side of that double square: this is two feet--what will that be?

boy: clearly, socrates, it will be double.

socrates: do you observe, meno, that i am not teaching the boy anything,
but only asking him questions; and now he fancies that he knows how long
a line is necessary in order to produce a figure of eight square feet;
does he not?

meno: yes.

socrates: and does he really know?

meno: certainly not.

socrates: he only guesses that because the square is double, the line is
double.

meno: true.

socrates: observe him while he recalls the steps in regular order. (to
the boy:) tell me, boy, do you assert that a double space comes from
a double line? remember that i am not speaking of an oblong, but of a
figure equal every way, and twice the size of this--that is to say
of eight feet; and i want to know whether you still say that a double
square comes from double line?

boy: yes.

socrates: but does not this line become doubled if we add another such
line here?

boy: certainly.

socrates: and four such lines will make a space containing eight feet?

boy: yes.

socrates: let us describe such a figure: would you not say that this is
the figure of eight feet?

boy: yes.

socrates: and are there not these four divisions in the figure, each of
which is equal to the figure of four feet?

boy: true.

socrates: and is not that four times four?

boy: certainly.

socrates: and four times is not double?

boy: no, indeed.

socrates: but how much?

boy: four times as much.

socrates: therefore the double line, boy, has given a space, not twice,
but four times as much.

boy: true.

socrates: four times four are sixteen--are they not?

boy: yes.

socrates: what line would give you a space of eight feet, as this gives
one of sixteen feet;--do you see?

boy: yes.

socrates: and the space of four feet is made from this half line?

boy: yes.

socrates: good; and is not a space of eight feet twice the size of this,
and half the size of the other?

boy: certainly.

socrates: such a space, then, will be made out of a line greater than
this one, and less than that one?

boy: yes; i think so.

socrates: very good; i like to hear you say what you think. and now tell
me, is not this a line of two feet and that of four?

boy: yes.

socrates: then the line which forms the side of eight feet ought to be
more than this line of two feet, and less than the other of four feet?

boy: it ought.

socrates: try and see if you can tell me how much it will be.

boy: three feet.

socrates: then if we add a half to this line of two, that will be the
line of three. here are two and there is one; and on the other side,
here are two also and there is one: and that makes the figure of which
you speak?

boy: yes.

socrates: but if there are three feet this way and three feet that way,
the whole space will be three times three feet?

boy: that is evident.

socrates: and how much are three times three feet?

boy: nine.

socrates: and how much is the double of four?

boy: eight.

socrates: then the figure of eight is not made out of a line of three?

boy: no.

socrates: but from what line?--tell me exactly; and if you would rather
not reckon, try and show me the line.

boy: indeed, socrates, i do not know.

socrates: do you see, meno, what advances he has made in his power of
recollection? he did not know at first, and he does not know now, what
is the side of a figure of eight feet: but then he thought that he knew,
and answered confidently as if he knew, and had no difficulty; now he
has a difficulty, and neither knows nor fancies that he knows.

meno: true.

socrates: is he not better off in knowing his ignorance?

meno: i think that he is.

socrates: if we have made him doubt, and given him the 'torpedo's
shock,' have we done him any harm?

meno: i think not.

socrates: we have certainly, as would seem, assisted him in some degree
to the discovery of the truth; and now he will wish to remedy his
ignorance, but then he would have been ready to tell all the world again
and again that the double space should have a double side.

meno: true.

socrates: but do you suppose that he would ever have enquired into or
learned what he fancied that he knew, though he was really ignorant of
it, until he had fallen into perplexity under the idea that he did not
know, and had desired to know?

meno: i think not, socrates.

socrates: then he was the better for the torpedo's touch?

meno: i think so.

socrates: mark now the farther development. i shall only ask him, and
not teach him, and he shall share the enquiry with me: and do you watch
and see if you find me telling or explaining anything to him, instead of
eliciting his opinion. tell me, boy, is not this a square of four feet
which i have drawn?

boy: yes.

socrates: and now i add another square equal to the former one?

boy: yes.

socrates: and a third, which is equal to either of them?

boy: yes.

socrates: suppose that we fill up the vacant corner?

boy: very good.

socrates: here, then, there are four equal spaces?

boy: yes.

socrates: and how many times larger is this space than this other?

boy: four times.

socrates: but it ought to have been twice only, as you will remember.

boy: true.

socrates: and does not this line, reaching from corner to corner, bisect
each of these spaces?

boy: yes.

socrates: and are there not here four equal lines which contain this
space?

boy: there are.

socrates: look and see how much this space is.

boy: i do not understand.

socrates: has not each interior line cut off half of the four spaces?

boy: yes.

socrates: and how many spaces are there in this section?

boy: four.

socrates: and how many in this?

boy: two.

socrates: and four is how many times two?

boy: twice.

socrates: and this space is of how many feet?

boy: of eight feet.

socrates: and from what line do you get this figure?

boy: from this.

socrates: that is, from the line which extends from corner to corner of
the figure of four feet?

boy: yes.

socrates: and that is the line which the learned call the diagonal.
and if this is the proper name, then you, meno's slave, are prepared to
affirm that the double space is the square of the diagonal?

boy: certainly, socrates.

socrates: what do you say of him, meno? were not all these answers given
out of his own head?

meno: yes, they were all his own.

socrates: and yet, as we were just now saying, he did not know?

meno: true.

socrates: but still he had in him those notions of his--had he not?

meno: yes.

socrates: then he who does not know may still have true notions of that
which he does not know?

meno: he has.

socrates: and at present these notions have just been stirred up in him,
as in a dream; but if he were frequently asked the same questions, in
different forms, he would know as well as any one at last?

meno: i dare say.

socrates: without any one teaching him he will recover his knowledge for
himself, if he is only asked questions?

meno: yes.

socrates: and this spontaneous recovery of knowledge in him is
recollection?

meno: true.

socrates: and this knowledge which he now has must he not either have
acquired or always possessed?

meno: yes.

socrates: but if he always possessed this knowledge he would always have
known; or if he has acquired the knowledge he could not have acquired it
in this life, unless he has been taught geometry; for he may be made to
do the same with all geometry and every other branch of knowledge. now,
has any one ever taught him all this? you must know about him, if, as
you say, he was born and bred in your house.

meno: and i am certain that no one ever did teach him.

socrates: and yet he has the knowledge?

meno: the fact, socrates, is undeniable.

socrates: but if he did not acquire the knowledge in this life, then he
must have had and learned it at some other time?

meno: clearly he must.

socrates: which must have been the time when he was not a man?

meno: yes.

socrates: and if there have been always true thoughts in him, both at
the time when he was and was not a man, which only need to be awakened
into knowledge by putting questions to him, his soul must have always
possessed this knowledge, for he always either was or was not a man?

meno: obviously.

socrates: and if the truth of all things always existed in the soul,
then the soul is immortal. wherefore be of good cheer, and try to
recollect what you do not know, or rather what you do not remember.

meno: i feel, somehow, that i like what you are saying.

socrates: and i, meno, like what i am saying. some things i have said
of which i am not altogether confident. but that we shall be better and
braver and less helpless if we think that we ought to enquire, than
we should have been if we indulged in the idle fancy that there was no
knowing and no use in seeking to know what we do not know;--that is a
theme upon which i am ready to fight, in word and deed, to the utmost of
my power.

meno: there again, socrates, your words seem to me excellent.

socrates: then, as we are agreed that a man should enquire about that
which he does not know, shall you and i make an effort to enquire
together into the nature of virtue?

meno: by all means, socrates. and yet i would much rather return to my
original question, whether in seeking to acquire virtue we should regard
it as a thing to be taught, or as a gift of nature, or as coming to men
in some other way?

socrates: had i the command of you as well as of myself, meno, i would
not have enquired whether virtue is given by instruction or not,
until we had first ascertained 'what it is.' but as you think only
of controlling me who am your slave, and never of controlling
yourself,--such being your notion of freedom, i must yield to you,
for you are irresistible. and therefore i have now to enquire into the
qualities of a thing of which i do not as yet know the nature. at any
rate, will you condescend a little, and allow the question 'whether
virtue is given by instruction, or in any other way,' to be argued upon
hypothesis? as the geometrician, when he is asked whether a certain
triangle is capable being inscribed in a certain circle (or, whether a
certain area is capable of being inscribed as a triangle in a certain
circle.), will reply: 'i cannot tell you as yet; but i will offer a
hypothesis which may assist us in forming a conclusion: if the figure be
such that when you have produced a given side of it (or, when you apply
it to the given line, i.e. the diameter of the circle (autou).), the
given area of the triangle falls short by an area corresponding to
the part produced (or, similar to the area so applied.), then one
consequence follows, and if this is impossible then some other; and
therefore i wish to assume a hypothesis before i tell you whether
this triangle is capable of being inscribed in the circle':--that is
a geometrical hypothesis. and we too, as we know not the nature and
qualities of virtue, must ask, whether virtue is or is not taught, under
a hypothesis: as thus, if virtue is of such a class of mental goods,
will it be taught or not? let the first hypothesis be that virtue is or
is not knowledge,--in that case will it be taught or not? or, as we were
just now saying, 'remembered'? for there is no use in disputing about
the name. but is virtue taught or not? or rather, does not every one see
that knowledge alone is taught?

meno: i agree.

socrates: then if virtue is knowledge, virtue will be taught?

meno: certainly.

socrates: then now we have made a quick end of this question: if virtue
is of such a nature, it will be taught; and if not, not?

meno: certainly.

socrates: the next question is, whether virtue is knowledge or of
another species?

meno: yes, that appears to be the question which comes next in order.

socrates: do we not say that virtue is a good?--this is a hypothesis
which is not set aside.

meno: certainly.

socrates: now, if there be any sort of good which is distinct from
knowledge, virtue may be that good; but if knowledge embraces all good,
then we shall be right in thinking that virtue is knowledge?

meno: true.

socrates: and virtue makes us good?

meno: yes.

socrates: and if we are good, then we are profitable; for all good
things are profitable?

meno: yes.

socrates: then virtue is profitable?

meno: that is the only inference.

socrates: then now let us see what are the things which severally profit
us. health and strength, and beauty and wealth--these, and the like of
these, we call profitable?

meno: true.

socrates: and yet these things may also sometimes do us harm: would you
not think so?

meno: yes.

socrates: and what is the guiding principle which makes them profitable
or the reverse? are they not profitable when they are rightly used, and
hurtful when they are not rightly used?

meno: certainly.

socrates: next, let us consider the goods of the soul: they are
temperance, justice, courage, quickness of apprehension, memory,
magnanimity, and the like?

meno: surely.

socrates: and such of these as are not knowledge, but of another sort,
are sometimes profitable and sometimes hurtful; as, for example, courage
wanting prudence, which is only a sort of confidence? when a man has no
sense he is harmed by courage, but when he has sense he is profited?

meno: true.

socrates: and the same may be said of temperance and quickness of
apprehension; whatever things are learned or done with sense are
profitable, but when done without sense they are hurtful?

meno: very true.

socrates: and in general, all that the soul attempts or endures, when
under the guidance of wisdom, ends in happiness; but when she is under
the guidance of folly, in the opposite?

meno: that appears to be true.

socrates: if then virtue is a quality of the soul, and is admitted to be
profitable, it must be wisdom or prudence, since none of the things of
the soul are either profitable or hurtful in themselves, but they are
all made profitable or hurtful by the addition of wisdom or of folly;
and therefore if virtue is profitable, virtue must be a sort of wisdom
or prudence?

meno: i quite agree.

socrates: and the other goods, such as wealth and the like, of which we
were just now saying that they are sometimes good and sometimes evil,
do not they also become profitable or hurtful, accordingly as the soul
guides and uses them rightly or wrongly; just as the things of the soul
herself are benefited when under the guidance of wisdom and harmed by
folly?

meno: true.

socrates: and the wise soul guides them rightly, and the foolish soul
wrongly.

meno: yes.

socrates: and is not this universally true of human nature? all other
things hang upon the soul, and the things of the soul herself hang upon
wisdom, if they are to be good; and so wisdom is inferred to be that
which profits--and virtue, as we say, is profitable?

meno: certainly.

socrates: and thus we arrive at the conclusion that virtue is either
wholly or partly wisdom?

meno: i think that what you are saying, socrates, is very true.

socrates: but if this is true, then the good are not by nature good?

meno: i think not.

socrates: if they had been, there would assuredly have been discerners
of characters among us who would have known our future great men; and on
their showing we should have adopted them, and when we had got them, we
should have kept them in the citadel out of the way of harm, and set a
stamp upon them far rather than upon a piece of gold, in order that no
one might tamper with them; and when they grew up they would have been
useful to the state?

meno: yes, socrates, that would have been the right way.

socrates: but if the good are not by nature good, are they made good by
instruction?

meno: there appears to be no other alternative, socrates. on the
supposition that virtue is knowledge, there can be no doubt that virtue
is taught.

socrates: yes, indeed; but what if the supposition is erroneous?

meno: i certainly thought just now that we were right.

socrates: yes, meno; but a principle which has any soundness should
stand firm not only just now, but always.

meno: well; and why are you so slow of heart to believe that knowledge
is virtue?

socrates: i will try and tell you why, meno. i do not retract the
assertion that if virtue is knowledge it may be taught; but i fear that
i have some reason in doubting whether virtue is knowledge: for consider
now and say whether virtue, and not only virtue but anything that is
taught, must not have teachers and disciples?

meno: surely.

socrates: and conversely, may not the art of which neither teachers nor
disciples exist be assumed to be incapable of being taught?

meno: true; but do you think that there are no teachers of virtue?

socrates: i have certainly often enquired whether there were any, and
taken great pains to find them, and have never succeeded; and many have
assisted me in the search, and they were the persons whom i thought the
most likely to know. here at the moment when he is wanted we fortunately
have sitting by us anytus, the very person of whom we should make
enquiry; to him then let us repair. in the first place, he is the son
of a wealthy and wise father, anthemion, who acquired his wealth, not
by accident or gift, like ismenias the theban (who has recently made
himself as rich as polycrates), but by his own skill and industry, and
who is a well-conditioned, modest man, not insolent, or overbearing, or
annoying; moreover, this son of his has received a good education, as
the athenian people certainly appear to think, for they choose him to
fill the highest offices. and these are the sort of men from whom you
are likely to learn whether there are any teachers of virtue, and who
they are. please, anytus, to help me and your friend meno in answering
our question, who are the teachers? consider the matter thus: if we
wanted meno to be a good physician, to whom should we send him? should
we not send him to the physicians?

anytus: certainly.

socrates: or if we wanted him to be a good cobbler, should we not send
him to the cobblers?

anytus: yes.

socrates: and so forth?

anytus: yes.

socrates: let me trouble you with one more question. when we say that we
should be right in sending him to the physicians if we wanted him to be
a physician, do we mean that we should be right in sending him to those
who profess the art, rather than to those who do not, and to those who
demand payment for teaching the art, and profess to teach it to any one
who will come and learn? and if these were our reasons, should we not be
right in sending him?

anytus: yes.

socrates: and might not the same be said of flute-playing, and of the
other arts? would a man who wanted to make another a flute-player refuse
to send him to those who profess to teach the art for money, and be
plaguing other persons to give him instruction, who are not professed
teachers and who never had a single disciple in that branch of knowledge
which he wishes him to acquire--would not such conduct be the height of
folly?

anytus: yes, by zeus, and of ignorance too.

socrates: very good. and now you are in a position to advise with me
about my friend meno. he has been telling me, anytus, that he desires
to attain that kind of wisdom and virtue by which men order the state or
the house, and honour their parents, and know when to receive and when
to send away citizens and strangers, as a good man should. now, to
whom should he go in order that he may learn this virtue? does not the
previous argument imply clearly that we should send him to those who
profess and avouch that they are the common teachers of all hellas, and
are ready to impart instruction to any one who likes, at a fixed price?

anytus: whom do you mean, socrates?

socrates: you surely know, do you not, anytus, that these are the people
whom mankind call sophists?

anytus: by heracles, socrates, forbear! i only hope that no friend or
kinsman or acquaintance of mine, whether citizen or stranger, will ever
be so mad as to allow himself to be corrupted by them; for they are
a manifest pest and corrupting influence to those who have to do with
them.

socrates: what, anytus? of all the people who profess that they know how
to do men good, do you mean to say that these are the only ones who not
only do them no good, but positively corrupt those who are entrusted to
them, and in return for this disservice have the face to demand money?
indeed, i cannot believe you; for i know of a single man, protagoras,
who made more out of his craft than the illustrious pheidias, who
created such noble works, or any ten other statuaries. how could that
be? a mender of old shoes, or patcher up of clothes, who made the shoes
or clothes worse than he received them, could not have remained thirty
days undetected, and would very soon have starved; whereas during more
than forty years, protagoras was corrupting all hellas, and sending his
disciples from him worse than he received them, and he was never found
out. for, if i am not mistaken, he was about seventy years old at his
death, forty of which were spent in the practice of his profession;
and during all that time he had a good reputation, which to this day he
retains: and not only protagoras, but many others are well spoken of;
some who lived before him, and others who are still living. now, when
you say that they deceived and corrupted the youth, are they to be
supposed to have corrupted them consciously or unconsciously? can those
who were deemed by many to be the wisest men of hellas have been out of
their minds?

anytus: out of their minds! no, socrates; the young men who gave their
money to them were out of their minds, and their relations and guardians
who entrusted their youth to the care of these men were still more out
of their minds, and most of all, the cities who allowed them to come in,
and did not drive them out, citizen and stranger alike.

socrates: has any of the sophists wronged you, anytus? what makes you so
angry with them?

anytus: no, indeed, neither i nor any of my belongings has ever had, nor
would i suffer them to have, anything to do with them.

socrates: then you are entirely unacquainted with them?

anytus: and i have no wish to be acquainted.

socrates: then, my dear friend, how can you know whether a thing is good
or bad of which you are wholly ignorant?

anytus: quite well; i am sure that i know what manner of men these are,
whether i am acquainted with them or not.

socrates: you must be a diviner, anytus, for i really cannot make out,
judging from your own words, how, if you are not acquainted with them,
you know about them. but i am not enquiring of you who are the teachers
who will corrupt meno (let them be, if you please, the sophists); i only
ask you to tell him who there is in this great city who will teach him
how to become eminent in the virtues which i was just now describing. he
is the friend of your family, and you will oblige him.

anytus: why do you not tell him yourself?

socrates: i have told him whom i supposed to be the teachers of these
things; but i learn from you that i am utterly at fault, and i dare say
that you are right. and now i wish that you, on your part, would tell me
to whom among the athenians he should go. whom would you name?

anytus: why single out individuals? any athenian gentleman, taken at
random, if he will mind him, will do far more good to him than the
sophists.

socrates: and did those gentlemen grow of themselves; and without having
been taught by any one, were they nevertheless able to teach others that
which they had never learned themselves?

anytus: i imagine that they learned of the previous generation of
gentlemen. have there not been many good men in this city?

socrates: yes, certainly, anytus; and many good statesmen also there
always have been and there are still, in the city of athens. but
the question is whether they were also good teachers of their own
virtue;--not whether there are, or have been, good men in this part of
the world, but whether virtue can be taught, is the question which we
have been discussing. now, do we mean to say that the good men of our
own and of other times knew how to impart to others that virtue
which they had themselves; or is virtue a thing incapable of being
communicated or imparted by one man to another? that is the question
which i and meno have been arguing. look at the matter in your own way:
would you not admit that themistocles was a good man?

anytus: certainly; no man better.

socrates: and must not he then have been a good teacher, if any man ever
was a good teacher, of his own virtue?

anytus: yes certainly,--if he wanted to be so.

socrates: but would he not have wanted? he would, at any rate, have
desired to make his own son a good man and a gentleman; he could not
have been jealous of him, or have intentionally abstained from
imparting to him his own virtue. did you never hear that he made his son
cleophantus a famous horseman; and had him taught to stand upright on
horseback and hurl a javelin, and to do many other marvellous things;
and in anything which could be learned from a master he was well
trained? have you not heard from our elders of him?

anytus: i have.

socrates: then no one could say that his son showed any want of
capacity?

anytus: very likely not.

socrates: but did any one, old or young, ever say in your hearing that
cleophantus, son of themistocles, was a wise or good man, as his father
was?

anytus: i have certainly never heard any one say so.

socrates: and if virtue could have been taught, would his father
themistocles have sought to train him in these minor accomplishments,
and allowed him who, as you must remember, was his own son, to be
no better than his neighbours in those qualities in which he himself
excelled?

anytus: indeed, indeed, i think not.

socrates: here was a teacher of virtue whom you admit to be among
the best men of the past. let us take another,--aristides, the son of
lysimachus: would you not acknowledge that he was a good man?

anytus: to be sure i should.

socrates: and did not he train his son lysimachus better than any other
athenian in all that could be done for him by the help of masters? but
what has been the result? is he a bit better than any other mortal?
he is an acquaintance of yours, and you see what he is like. there is
pericles, again, magnificent in his wisdom; and he, as you are aware,
had two sons, paralus and xanthippus.

anytus: i know.

socrates: and you know, also, that he taught them to be unrivalled
horsemen, and had them trained in music and gymnastics and all sorts of
arts--in these respects they were on a level with the best--and had
he no wish to make good men of them? nay, he must have wished it. but
virtue, as i suspect, could not be taught. and that you may not suppose
the incompetent teachers to be only the meaner sort of athenians and
few in number, remember again that thucydides had two sons, melesias and
stephanus, whom, besides giving them a good education in other things,
he trained in wrestling, and they were the best wrestlers in athens: one
of them he committed to the care of xanthias, and the other of eudorus,
who had the reputation of being the most celebrated wrestlers of that
day. do you remember them?

anytus: i have heard of them.

socrates: now, can there be a doubt that thucydides, whose children were
taught things for which he had to spend money, would have taught them
to be good men, which would have cost him nothing, if virtue could have
been taught? will you reply that he was a mean man, and had not many
friends among the athenians and allies? nay, but he was of a great
family, and a man of influence at athens and in all hellas, and, if
virtue could have been taught, he would have found out some athenian
or foreigner who would have made good men of his sons, if he could not
himself spare the time from cares of state. once more, i suspect, friend
anytus, that virtue is not a thing which can be taught?

anytus: socrates, i think that you are too ready to speak evil of men:
and, if you will take my advice, i would recommend you to be careful.
perhaps there is no city in which it is not easier to do men harm than
to do them good, and this is certainly the case at athens, as i believe
that you know.

socrates: o meno, think that anytus is in a rage. and he may well be
in a rage, for he thinks, in the first place, that i am defaming these
gentlemen; and in the second place, he is of opinion that he is one
of them himself. but some day he will know what is the meaning of
defamation, and if he ever does, he will forgive me. meanwhile i will
return to you, meno; for i suppose that there are gentlemen in your
region too?

meno: certainly there are.

socrates: and are they willing to teach the young? and do they profess
to be teachers? and do they agree that virtue is taught?

meno: no indeed, socrates, they are anything but agreed; you may hear
them saying at one time that virtue can be taught, and then again the
reverse.

socrates: can we call those teachers who do not acknowledge the
possibility of their own vocation?

meno: i think not, socrates.

socrates: and what do you think of these sophists, who are the only
professors? do they seem to you to be teachers of virtue?

meno: i often wonder, socrates, that gorgias is never heard promising to
teach virtue: and when he hears others promising he only laughs at them;
but he thinks that men should be taught to speak.

socrates: then do you not think that the sophists are teachers?

meno: i cannot tell you, socrates; like the rest of the world, i am in
doubt, and sometimes i think that they are teachers and sometimes not.

socrates: and are you aware that not you only and other politicians have
doubts whether virtue can be taught or not, but that theognis the poet
says the very same thing?

meno: where does he say so?

socrates: in these elegiac verses (theog.):

'eat and drink and sit with the mighty, and make yourself agreeable to
them; for from the good you will learn what is good, but if you mix with
the bad you will lose the intelligence which you already have.'

do you observe that here he seems to imply that virtue can be taught?

meno: clearly.

socrates: but in some other verses he shifts about and says (theog.):

'if understanding could be created and put into a man, then they' (who
were able to perform this feat) 'would have obtained great rewards.'

and again:--

'never would a bad son have sprung from a good sire, for he would have
heard the voice of instruction; but not by teaching will you ever make a
bad man into a good one.'

and this, as you may remark, is a contradiction of the other.

meno: clearly.

socrates: and is there anything else of which the professors are
affirmed not only not to be teachers of others, but to be ignorant
themselves, and bad at the knowledge of that which they are professing
to teach? or is there anything about which even the acknowledged
'gentlemen' are sometimes saying that 'this thing can be taught,' and
sometimes the opposite? can you say that they are teachers in any true
sense whose ideas are in such confusion?

meno: i should say, certainly not.

socrates: but if neither the sophists nor the gentlemen are teachers,
clearly there can be no other teachers?

meno: no.

socrates: and if there are no teachers, neither are there disciples?

meno: agreed.

socrates: and we have admitted that a thing cannot be taught of which
there are neither teachers nor disciples?

meno: we have.

socrates: and there are no teachers of virtue to be found anywhere?

meno: there are not.

socrates: and if there are no teachers, neither are there scholars?

meno: that, i think, is true.

socrates: then virtue cannot be taught?

meno: not if we are right in our view. but i cannot believe, socrates,
that there are no good men: and if there are, how did they come into
existence?

socrates: i am afraid, meno, that you and i are not good for much, and
that gorgias has been as poor an educator of you as prodicus has been of
me. certainly we shall have to look to ourselves, and try to find
some one who will help in some way or other to improve us. this i say,
because i observe that in the previous discussion none of us remarked
that right and good action is possible to man under other guidance than
that of knowledge (episteme);--and indeed if this be denied, there is no
seeing how there can be any good men at all.

meno: how do you mean, socrates?

socrates: i mean that good men are necessarily useful or profitable.
were we not right in admitting this? it must be so.

meno: yes.

socrates: and in supposing that they will be useful only if they are
true guides to us of action--there we were also right?

meno: yes.

socrates: but when we said that a man cannot be a good guide unless he
have knowledge (phrhonesis), this we were wrong.

meno: what do you mean by the word 'right'?

socrates: i will explain. if a man knew the way to larisa, or anywhere
else, and went to the place and led others thither, would he not be a
right and good guide?

meno: certainly.

socrates: and a person who had a right opinion about the way, but had
never been and did not know, might be a good guide also, might he not?

meno: certainly.

socrates: and while he has true opinion about that which the other
knows, he will be just as good a guide if he thinks the truth, as he who
knows the truth?

meno: exactly.

socrates: then true opinion is as good a guide to correct action as
knowledge; and that was the point which we omitted in our speculation
about the nature of virtue, when we said that knowledge only is the
guide of right action; whereas there is also right opinion.

meno: true.

socrates: then right opinion is not less useful than knowledge?

meno: the difference, socrates, is only that he who has knowledge will
always be right; but he who has right opinion will sometimes be right,
and sometimes not.

socrates: what do you mean? can he be wrong who has right opinion, so
long as he has right opinion?

meno: i admit the cogency of your argument, and therefore, socrates, i
wonder that knowledge should be preferred to right opinion--or why they
should ever differ.

socrates: and shall i explain this wonder to you?

meno: do tell me.

socrates: you would not wonder if you had ever observed the images of
daedalus (compare euthyphro); but perhaps you have not got them in your
country?

meno: what have they to do with the question?

socrates: because they require to be fastened in order to keep them, and
if they are not fastened they will play truant and run away.

meno: well, what of that?

socrates: i mean to say that they are not very valuable possessions if
they are at liberty, for they will walk off like runaway slaves; but
when fastened, they are of great value, for they are really beautiful
works of art. now this is an illustration of the nature of true
opinions: while they abide with us they are beautiful and fruitful,
but they run away out of the human soul, and do not remain long, and
therefore they are not of much value until they are fastened by the tie
of the cause; and this fastening of them, friend meno, is recollection,
as you and i have agreed to call it. but when they are bound, in the
first place, they have the nature of knowledge; and, in the second
place, they are abiding. and this is why knowledge is more honourable
and excellent than true opinion, because fastened by a chain.

meno: what you are saying, socrates, seems to be very like the truth.

socrates: i too speak rather in ignorance; i only conjecture. and yet
that knowledge differs from true opinion is no matter of conjecture with
me. there are not many things which i profess to know, but this is most
certainly one of them.

meno: yes, socrates; and you are quite right in saying so.

socrates: and am i not also right in saying that true opinion leading
the way perfects action quite as well as knowledge?

meno: there again, socrates, i think you are right.

socrates: then right opinion is not a whit inferior to knowledge, or
less useful in action; nor is the man who has right opinion inferior to
him who has knowledge?

meno: true.

socrates: and surely the good man has been acknowledged by us to be
useful?

meno: yes.

socrates: seeing then that men become good and useful to states, not
only because they have knowledge, but because they have right opinion,
and that neither knowledge nor right opinion is given to man by nature
or acquired by him--(do you imagine either of them to be given by
nature?

meno: not i.)

socrates: then if they are not given by nature, neither are the good by
nature good?

meno: certainly not.

socrates: and nature being excluded, then came the question whether
virtue is acquired by teaching?

meno: yes.

socrates: if virtue was wisdom (or knowledge), then, as we thought, it
was taught?

meno: yes.

socrates: and if it was taught it was wisdom?

meno: certainly.

socrates: and if there were teachers, it might be taught; and if there
were no teachers, not?

meno: true.

socrates: but surely we acknowledged that there were no teachers of
virtue?

meno: yes.

socrates: then we acknowledged that it was not taught, and was not
wisdom?

meno: certainly.

socrates: and yet we admitted that it was a good?

meno: yes.

socrates: and the right guide is useful and good?

meno: certainly.

socrates: and the only right guides are knowledge and true
opinion--these are the guides of man; for things which happen by chance
are not under the guidance of man: but the guides of man are true
opinion and knowledge.

meno: i think so too.

socrates: but if virtue is not taught, neither is virtue knowledge.

meno: clearly not.

socrates: then of two good and useful things, one, which is knowledge,
has been set aside, and cannot be supposed to be our guide in political
life.

meno: i think not.

socrates: and therefore not by any wisdom, and not because they were
wise, did themistocles and those others of whom anytus spoke govern
states. this was the reason why they were unable to make others like
themselves--because their virtue was not grounded on knowledge.

meno: that is probably true, socrates.

socrates: but if not by knowledge, the only alternative which remains
is that statesmen must have guided states by right opinion, which is in
politics what divination is in religion; for diviners and also prophets
say many things truly, but they know not what they say.

meno: so i believe.

socrates: and may we not, meno, truly call those men 'divine' who,
having no understanding, yet succeed in many a grand deed and word?

meno: certainly.

socrates: then we shall also be right in calling divine those whom we
were just now speaking of as diviners and prophets, including the whole
tribe of poets. yes, and statesmen above all may be said to be divine
and illumined, being inspired and possessed of god, in which condition
they say many grand things, not knowing what they say.

meno: yes.

socrates: and the women too, meno, call good men divine--do they not?
and the spartans, when they praise a good man, say 'that he is a divine
man.'

meno: and i think, socrates, that they are right; although very likely
our friend anytus may take offence at the word.

socrates: i do not care; as for anytus, there will be another
opportunity of talking with him. to sum up our enquiry--the result
seems to be, if we are at all right in our view, that virtue is neither
natural nor acquired, but an instinct given by god to the virtuous. nor
is the instinct accompanied by reason, unless there may be supposed to
be among statesmen some one who is capable of educating statesmen. and
if there be such an one, he may be said to be among the living
what homer says that tiresias was among the dead, 'he alone has
understanding; but the rest are flitting shades'; and he and his virtue
in like manner will be a reality among shadows.

meno: that is excellent, socrates.

socrates: then, meno, the conclusion is that virtue comes to the
virtuous by the gift of god. but we shall never know the certain truth
until, before asking how virtue is given, we enquire into the actual
nature of virtue. i fear that i must go away, but do you, now that you
are persuaded yourself, persuade our friend anytus. and do not let him
be so exasperated; if you can conciliate him, you will have done good
service to the athenian people.
